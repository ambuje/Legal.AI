If a decision under s. 12 is reached byassuming jurisdiction which the court does not possess or without observing the formalities which are prescribedfor reaching such a decision, the order obviously would be revisable by the High Court in the exercise of revisionalpowers.

C.) in Civil First Appeal No. 16 of 1944, arising out of the Judgment and Decree datedMarch 13, 1944, of the Court of the Judge, Small Causes, Ajmer, and Additional District Judge, Ajmer, in Civil SuitNo. 28 of 1942.S. S. Deedwania for the appellant.M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, (J. N, Sharma, with him) for the respondents, 199 1952. November 10.The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN'J.-This is an appeal by special leave granted by the PrivyCouncil and limited to the question of court-fee, viz., whether the memorandum of appeal presented to the HighCourt court-fee was payable under section 7 (iv) (e) or article 17 of Schedule II of the Court-Fees Act.The question whether the memorandum of appeal was properly stamped arose in the following circumstances:Edward-Mills Co. Ltd. is a joint stock company situate in Beawar, Ajmer- Merwara. In accordance with theprovisions of the articles of the company one Seth Gadh Mal Lodha and Rai Sahib Moti Lal (respondent No. 2)were its chairman and managing director respectively since 1916. Seth Gadh Mal Lodha represented his family'ï¬rm of Kanwal Nain Hamir Singh, while Rai Sahib Moti Lal represented the joint family ï¬rm of Champa Lal RamSwaroop, 1st July, 1938, Rai Sahib Moti Lal and his ï¬rm were adjudged insolvents by the Bombay High Court. Theresult was that respondent No. 2 had to vacate the oï¬ƒce of managing director and -the members of his ï¬rm alsobecame ineligibleforit. By a resolution of the board of direetors passed 18th July, 1938, Gadh Mal Lodha wasappointed to take the place of Rai Sahib Moti Lal as managing director. Gadh Mal Lodha died llth January, 1942,and the board of directors then appointed Seth -Sobhagmal Lodha to act as chairman as well as managing directortill the, appointment was made by the company. An extraordinary meeting of the company was called for the 8thFebruary, 1945, for the election of the chairman. At this meeting conï¬‚ict &rose between the two groupsrepresented by Sobhagmal Lodha and Moti Lal. The chairman therefore dissolved the meeting but the supportersof Moti Lal continued to hold it and passed a resolution appointing him as the sole agent and chairman for a periodof twenty years a remuneration equal to ten per cent of the proï¬ts of the company It-is this 200 resolution of the8th February, 1942, which has led to the present dispute.Seth Sobhagmal in the situation that arose approached the District Judge of Ajmer with the prayer that a generalmeeting of the company may be held under the supervision of the court. This request was allowed 11th February,1942, and the court ordered that the meeting be held 12th February, 1942, under the chairmanship of SethSobhagmal.Respondent No. 2 being aggrieved by this order, ï¬led an ap- plication in revision in the Court of the 'judicialCommissioner impugning the order. The learned Judicial Commissioner allowed the revision and directed that theresolution of the 8th February, 1942, should be acted upon.Having failed to get redress in the summary proceedings, the appellant then ï¬led the suit out of which this appealarises for quashing the resolution of the 8th February, 1942. In the plaint he asked for the following relies:-1. That it be declared that the appointment of defendant No. 2 is illegal, invalid and ultra vires and that he has noright to act as chairman, managing director etc.of defendant No. 1;2. That a receiver be appointed to take charge of the management of the company, until a properly qualiï¬edchairman managing director etc. are duly appointed as required by the memorandum and articles of the company.The plaint bore a court-fee stamp of Rs. 10 only, but the objection of the respondents that court-fee was payablerelief No. 2 the appellants paid ad valorem fee Rs. 51,000 which was the valuation of the suit for purposes ofjurisdiction.The Additional District Judge dismissed the suit the preliminary ground that it was not maintainable as it related tothe internal management of the company and that the, appellants had no right to bring it without impleading thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/12/58.html/020959595999526 9/12/2NEMI CHAND & ANR V. THE EDW ARD MILLS CO. L TD.& ANR [ 12] INSC 58; AIR 13 SC 28; 13 SCR 17 (10 November 1â€¦directors who were necessary parties to it.201 Aggrieved by this decision of the trials Judge, the appellants preferred an appeal to the Court of the JudicialCommissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, at Ajmer. The memorandum of appeal was Stamped with a courtfee stamp of Rs.1 0 and it was expressly stated therein that relief No. 2 of the plaint was given up. An objection was raisedregarding the amount of courtfee paid the memorandum of appeal. The Judicial Commissioner ordered thatproper court-fees be paid thereon in a month. In this order no reasons were given for this decision. The additionalfee demanded was not paid, and the Judicial Commissioner dismissed the appeal with costs 22nd March, 1945. Anapplication was made for leave to appeal to the Privy Council against this order but, it was refused.In the order refusing leave it was said as follows:- "" appeal to this court, the memorandum was again stamped witha ten rupee stamp only and the respondents therefore objected. It having been conceded by plaintiï¬€s earlier thatthe relief for the receivership was consequential to the relief for the declaration, the appellants were directed topay the same stamp as had been -paid in the trial Court.They objected stating that they had expunged from their memorandum of appeal the request that the courtshould appoint a receiver and that they were not, therefore, liable to pay the same amount this a notice was issuedand counsel were beard.It being clearly set out in section 42 of the Speciï¬c Relief Act that no court shall grarant a declaration only wherethe plaintiï¬€ being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title omits to do so, the appellants weredirected to pay as earlier ordered the same amount as bad ultimately been paid the plaint. They had earlier soughta consequential relief and the court 'was, therefore, entirelv unable to hold that the plaintiï¬€s were unable to seek afurther relief, they having sought the relief in the lower court and it having been refused to them. The amount of-the stamp was not paid and the appeal was therefore dis- missed with costs."" 202 The reasons for demandingadditional court-fee, though not mentioned in the original order, are stated in this order.The question for determination in this appeal is whether the order of the Judicial Commissioner demandingadditional court-fee can be sustained in law. A memorandum of appeal, as provided in article 1 of Schedule I of theCourt-Fees Act, has to be stamped according to the value of the subject-matter in dispute in appeal; in otherwords, the relief claimed in the memorandum of appeal determines the value of the appeal for purposes of court-fee. The only relief claimed in the memorandum of appeal was the ï¬rst one mentioned in the plaint. This reliefbeing purely of a declaratory character, the memorandum of appeal was properly stamped under article 17 ofSchedule II It is always open to the appellant in appeal to give up a portion of his claim and to restrict it. It is furtheropen to him; unless the relief is of such a nature that it cannot be split up, to relinquish a part of the claim and tobring it within the amount of court-fee already paid: Brahnmnandam v. Secretary of State for India(1); Ram Prasadv. Bhiman(2);Karam Chand v. Jullundur Bank Ltd(1); Neelachalam v. Nara- singha Das(4); Sah Bamehand v. Pannalal(5); ChuniLal v.Sheo Charanlat Lalman(1). The plaintiï¬€s in express terms relinquished the second relief,they had claimed in theplaint, in their memorandum of appeal. For the purpose of deciding whether the memorandum of appeal wasproperly stamped according to the subjectmatter of the appeal, it was not open to the Judicial Commissioner tocanvass the question whether the suit with the second prayer eliminated from it fell within the mischief of theproviso to section 42 of the Speciï¬c Relief Act. That was a question which related to the merits of the appeal anddid not concern its proper institution this ground, therefore, the Judicial Commissioner had no jurisdiction todemand (I) (1930) I.L.R. 53 Mad. 48 (2) (1905) I.L.R. 27 All. 151.(3) A.I.R. 1927 Leh. 543.(4) A.R. 1931 Mad 716.(5) A.I.R. 1929 All. 308.(6) (1925) I.L.R. 47 All. 756.203 additional fee from the plaintiï¬€s and the appeal could not be dismissed for failure to meet it. We are thus ofthe opinion that the order demanding additional court-fee the memorandum of appeal as it stood,' that is, minuswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/12/58.html/020959595999536 9/12/2NEMI CHAND & ANR V. THE EDW ARD MILLS CO. L TD.& ANR [ 12] INSC 58; AIR 13 SC 28; 13 SCR 17 (10 November 1â€¦the second prayer, was erroneous and we hold that the memorandum of appeal was properly stamped, as thesubject-matter of the appeal was purely of a declaratory character.Mr. Setalvad for the respondents contended that the ï¬rst relief claimed in the plaint, and which was the subject-matter of the appeal included within it consequential relief and was not purely declaratory in nature and thereforethe Judicial Commissioner was right in demanding additional court-fee the value of the consequential relief. It wassaid that the words that respondent No. 2 ""had no right to act as chairman and managing director"" amounted to aclaim for consequential relief. We are unable to agree. The claim contained in the ï¬rst relief of the plaint is to theeï¬€ect that it be declared that defendant No. 2 has no right to act as chairman an managing director because of hisappointment being illegal, invalid, and ultra vires. The declaration claimed is in negative form that defendant No. 2has no right to act as chairman and managing director. No claim for a consequential relief can be read within thisprayer. The words ""that defendant 2 has no right to act as chairman.......'' are mere repetition and reiteration ofwhat is contained in the opening sentence of the paragraph.This contention of Mr. Setalvad, therefore, cannot be sustained.It was next contended that in view of the provisions of section 12 of the Court-Fees Act it should be held that thedecision of the Judicial Commissioner' was ï¬nal, and could not be challenged in appeal. Section 12 of the Court-Fees Act enacts as follows:""Every question relating to Situation for the purpose of determining the amount of any fee chargeable under thischapter a plaint or memorandumu 204 of appeal shall be decided by the court in which such plaint ormemorandum, as the case may be, is ï¬led, and such decision shall be ï¬nal as between the parties 'to the suit."" Theprovisions of this section have to be read and construed keeping in view the provisions of the Code of CivilProcedure. Order VII, Rule 11, Civil Procedure Code, provides as follows:- ""The plaint shall be rejected- (b) wherethe relief claimed is undervalued and the plaintiï¬€, being required by the court to correct the valuation within atime- to be ï¬xed by the court, fails to do so;......(d) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is written upon paper insuï¬ƒciently stamped, and theplaintiï¬€, being required by the court to supply the requisite stamp paper within a time to be ï¬xed by the court, failsto do so."" An order rejecting a plaint is a decree as deï¬ned in section 2; sub-section (ii), and is appealable as such.There is an apparent conï¬‚ict between the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the provisions of section 12which make the order relating to valuation ï¬nal and eï¬€orts to reconcile the provisions of the Court-Fees Act andthe Code have resulted in some divergence of judicial opinion the construction of the section. In a number ofdecisions the Calcutta High Court took the view that the ï¬nality declared by section 12 of the Court-Fees Act hadbeen taken away by the relevant provisions of the Code, as the order rejecting a plaint was appealable as a decree,no matter whether the dispute related to the category under which the same falls for purposes of court-fee or onlyto valuation pure and simple under a particular category: Vide In re Omrao Mirza v. Mary Jones(,) and TaraPrasanna Chongdar v.Nrisingha Moorari Pal(1). This extreme view has not been maintained in later decisions and it has been held thatthe ï¬nality declared by section 12 is limited only to the question (1883) 12 C.L.R. 148.(2) (1924) I.L..R. 51 Cal. 216.205 of valuation pure and simple and does not relate to the category under which a certain suit falls: TarimanKhatun v.Secretary o State for India in Council(1). The Allahabad High Court in its earlier decisions took the extreme view:Vide Muhammad Sadik v. Muhammad Jan(2). Later that -court veered round to the view that the ï¬nality declaredby section 12 only related to matters of, appraisement. The High Court of Lahore has placed a similar constructionthe meaning of the expression ""valuation"" in section 12 and has held that the ï¬nality attaches only to a decisionwhich concerns valuation simpliciter and no ï¬nality attaches when a court decides a question whether a case fallswithin one or other category of the cases mentioned in the diï¬€erent sections and schedule of the Court Fees Act:Vide Mahna Singh v. Bahadur Singh(1); Mst. Parmeshri v. PannaLal(1).Thisviewhasconsistentlybeenheldin thatcourt. The Madras High Court took the same view in Lakshmi Amma v.Janamajayam Nambiar(5); Annamalai Chetty V. Cloete(6); and Narasimhalu Chetty v. Bamayya Naidu(7). Mr.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/12/58.html/020959595999546 9/12/2NEMI CHAND & ANR V. THE EDW ARD MILLS CO. L TD.& ANR [ 12] INSC 58; AIR 13 SC 28; 13 SCR 17 (10 November 1â€¦Setalvad drew our attention to the recent Full Bench decision of that court in Madana Mohana Naiko v.Krupasindhu Naiko(1). That case, however, concerned the second part of section 12 and was not concerneddirectly with the construction to be placed the ï¬rst part of the section. It, however, contains certain observationsindicating that in the opinion of the judges there was no ground for this restricted construction of the word ""valuation "" in section 12 and that the ï¬nality declared bysection 12 attached not only to valuation pure and simplebut also attached to decisions relating to category under which a suit or appeal falls for purposes of court-fee.These obiter observations, however, cannot be said to ,,overrule the earlier Full Beach decision of that court inLakshmi Amma v. Janamajayam Nambiar(5). In a (1) I.I.R.(1940) 2 Cal. 166.(2) (1889) I.L.R. II All. 91, F.B.(3) 1919 Punjab Record 16.(4) A I.R. 1931 Lah. 378.27 (5) (1894) 4 M.L.J. 183, F.B.(6) (1882) I.L.R. 4 Mad. 204.(7) A.I.R. 1942 Mad. 502.(8) A.I.R. 1937 Mad. 81.206 later decision in Narasimhalu Chetty v. Bamayya Naidu(1), the decision of the Full Bench was explained as notin any way overruling the decision in Lakshmi Amma v. Janamajayam Nambiar(2). All recent decisions of theBombay High Court have taken the same view: Vide Dada v. Nagesh(3); Krishnaji Bari Dhandhere v. Gopal NarainDhandhere(4). Mr. Setalvad drew our attention to an earlier decision of the Bombay High Court in Vithal Krishna v.Balakrishna Janardan(5). In that case the court undoubtedly held that no appeal lay and the ï¬nality declared bysection 12 was comprehensive enough to include all questions whether relating to category or valuation pure andsimple. It was, however, held that the High Court could correct an erroneous decision in the exercise of itsrevisional powers. Thus the ï¬nality declared by section 12 was destroyed by the exercise of powers of appeal underthe guise of exercising revisional jurisdiction. In Patna and Oudh the game view has been taken as in Lahore. VideChandramoni Koer v. Basdeo Narain Singh (6); Gumani v. Banwari(7). It thus appears that the consensus of judicialopinion is against the construction suggested by Mr. Setalvad. We think that the construction given to thelanguage in section 12 in these decisions is right, and our reasons for saying so are these:The diï¬€erence in the phraseology employed in sections 5 and 12 of the Court-Fees Act indicates that the scope ofsection 12 is narrower than that of section 5. Section 5 which declares decisions questions of court-fee wheneverthey arise in the chartered High Courts as ï¬nal makes a decision as to the necessity of paying a fee or the amountthereof ï¬nal. Whereas section 12 makes a decision every question relating to valuation for the purpose ofdetermining the amount of any fee payable under chapter 3 a plaint or memorandum of appeal ï¬nal. Had section12 been drafted somewhat as follows (i) A.I.R. 1942 Mad. 502.(5) (1886) I.L.R. lo Bom. 610, F.B, (2) (1894) 4 M.L.J.183 F.B.(6) (1921) 4 P.L.J. 57.(3) (1899) I.L.R. 23 Bom. 486.(7) (1920) 54 I.C. 733.(4) A.I.R. 1936 Bom. 166.207 ""If any dispute arises as to the amount of any fee chargeable under this chapter a plaint or memorandum ofappeal, it shall be decided by the court in which such plaint or memorandum is ï¬led and such decision shall be ï¬nalas between the parties$), then the construction contended for by Mr. Setalvad might have been upheld. When thetwo sections in the same Act relating to the same subject matter have been drafted in diï¬€erent language, it is notunreasonable to infer that they were enacted with a diï¬€erent intention and that in one case the intention was togive ï¬nality to all decisions of the taxing oï¬ƒcer or the taxing judge, as the case may be, while in the other case itwas only intended to give ï¬nality to questions of fact that are decided by a court but not to questions of law.Whether a case falls under one particular section of the Act or another is a pure question of law and does notdirectly determine the valuation of the suit for 'purposes of court-fee. The question of determination of valuationor appraisement only arises after it is settled in what class or category it falls.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/12/58.html/020959595999556 9/12/2NEMI CHAND & ANR V. THE EDW ARD MILLS CO. L TD.& ANR [ 12] INSC 58; AIR 13 SC 28; 13 SCR 17 (10 November 1â€¦It has been argued in some decisions that it is absolutely necessary to decide the category in which a case fallsbefore assessing its value and therefore the determination of the question of category is necessarily involved inthe determination of the valuation of the suit for purposes of courtfee. This argument, though plausible, does notseem sound. The actual assessment of the value depends either arithmetical calculations or upon a valuation by anexpert and the evidence led in the case, while the decision of the question of category is one of law and may wellbe said to be an independent question antecedent but not relating to valuation. The expression "" valuation""interpreted in its ordinary meaning Of ""appraisement"", cannot be said to necessarily include within its ambit thequestion of category which is a matter of law. The construction placed this section by a long course of decisions isone which 208 reconciles the provisions of the Court-Fees Act with that of the Code of Civil Procedure and doesnot make those provisions nugatory and is therefore more acceptable than the other constructions which wouldmake the provisions of either one or the other of these statutes nugatory. Perhaps it may be possible to reconcilethe provisions of the two statutes by holding that the ï¬nality declared by section 12 of the Court-Fees Act meansthat the parties cannot impugn such a decision by preferring an appeal but that it does not confer such decisions acomplete immunity from examination in a higher court. In other words section 12 when it says that such a decisionshall be ï¬nal between the parties only makes the decision of the court a question of court-fee nonap pealable andplaces it the same footing as other interlocutory nod-appealable orders under the Code and it does no more thanthat. If a decision under section 12 is reached by assuming jurisdiction which the court does not possess or withoutobserving the formalities which are prescribed for reaching such a) decision, the order obviously would berevisable by the High Court in the exercise of revisional powers. Similarly, when a party thinking that a decisionunder section 12 is palpably wrong takes the risk of his plaint being rejected or suit dismissed and then appealsfrom the order rejecting the plaint or from the decree dismissing the suit but not from the decision the question ofcourt-fee, then it is open to him to challenge the interlocutory order even the question of court-fee made in thesuit or apppal. The word ""ï¬nality"" construed in the limited sense in which it is often used in statutes means that noappeal lies from an order of this character as such and it means no more than that.Conceding for the sake of argument but not admitting-that Mr. Setalvad is right in his contention that section 12 iscomprehensive enough to include within its ambit all questions relating to court-fee whether they involve adecision as to question of category or as to valuation simpliciter, in the present 209 case the Judicial Commissionerdecided none of these questions and: his decision cannot be said to be one falling within the ambit of section 12.All that the Judicial Commissioner decided was that as the suit could not be maintained without asking for reliefNo. 2, the same fee was payable the memorandum of appeal as the plaint. In substance the court decided an issueregarding the maintainability of the appeal without ï¬rst deciding whether the appeal had been properly institutedin that court. No ï¬nality can attach to such a decision by the provisions of section 12, as in reality it decides noquestion within, the ambit of section 12 of the Court-Fees Act.For the reasons given above the second objection raised by Mr. Setalvad that no appeal lies from the order of theJudicial Commissioner by special leave is without force and is overruled.The result, is, that the appeal is allowed, the decision of the Judicial 'Commissioner dismissing the appeal is setaside and the case remanded to him for decision in accordance with law the basis that the memorandum of appealpresented to him was properly stamped. The appellants' costs of this appeal will be costs in the appeal in the Courtof the Judicial Commissioner.Appeal allowed.Agent for the appellant: Rajinder Narain.Agent for the respondents: S P.

Under the old rules candidates were required to give their caste,but on 23-7- 1949 this was changed and instead of caste their occupation had to be entered. The only person whokept himself abreast of the law was the ï¬rst respondent.

Allthe other candidates, including the appellant, ï¬lled in their forms as they stood and entered their caste and nottheir occupation. The ï¬rst respondent raised an objection before the Supervising Oï¬ƒcer and contended that allthe other nominations were s; invalid and claimed that he should be elected as his was the only valid nominationpaper. The objection was overruled and the election proceeded.The appellant secured the highest number of votes and was declared to be elected. The ï¬rst respondentthereupon ï¬led the election petition out of which this appeal arises.He failed in the trial Court. The learned Judge held that the defect was not substantial and so held that it wascurable. This was reversed by the High Court on revision.The learned High Court Judges referred to a decision of this Court in Rattan Anmol Singh v. Atma Ram(1) and heldthat any failure to comply with any of the provisions set out in the various rules is fatal and that in such cases thenomination paper must be rejected.We do not think that is right and we deprecate this tendency towards technicality; it is the substance that countsand must take precedence over mere form. Some rules are vital and go to the root of the matter: they cannot bebroken;others are only directory and a breach of them can be overlooked provided there is substantial compliance withthe rules read as whole and provided no prejudice ensues; and when the legislature does not itself state which iswhich judges must determine the matter and, exercising a nice discrimination, sort out one class from the otheralong broad based, commonsense lines. This principle was enunciated by Viscount Maugham in Punjab Co-operative Bank Ltd., Amritsar v. Incometax Oï¬ƒcer, Lahore(2) and was quoted by the learned High Court judges-'""It is a well settled general rule that an absolute enactment must be obeyed or fulï¬lled exactly, but it is suï¬ƒcient ifa directory enactment be obeyed or fulï¬lled substantially"".(1) [ 1954] INSC 71; [ 1955] 1 S.C.R. 481.(2) [ 1940] L.R. 07 I.A. 464, 476, 1032 But apart from that, this is to be found in the Act itself.The learned High Court Judges were of opinion that the directions here about the occupation were mandatory.That, we think, is wrong.The present matter is governed by section 18 of the Central Provinces and Berar Municipalities Act (II) of 1922.Among other things, the section empowers the State Government to ""make rules under this Act regulating themode............of election of presidents....."" and section 175(1) directs that ""all rules for which provision is made in this Act shall bemade by the State Government and shall be consistent with this Act"", Now one of the provisions of the Act, theone that directly concerns us, is set out in section 23:""Anything done or any proceeding taken under this Act shall not be questioned on account of any defect orirregularity not aï¬€ecting the merits of the case"".The rules have therefore to be construed in the light of that provision.Rule 9 (1)(i) states that- "" each candidate shall.....deliver to the Supervising Oï¬ƒcer a nomination paper completedin the form appended and subscribed by the candidate himself as assenting to the nomination and by two dulyqualiï¬ed electors as proposer and seconder"".The amended form requires the candidate to give, among other things, his name, father's name, age, address andoccupation; and rule 9(1)(iii) directs that the Supervising Oï¬ƒcer ""shall examine the nomination papers and shalldecide all objections which may be made to any nomination and may either on such objection or on his ownmotion, after such summary enquiry, if any, as he thinks necessary, refuse any nomination on any of the followinggrounds:* * * * 1o33 (C) that there has been any failure to comply with any of the provisions of clause (i)........."" It wascontended that the word ""may"" which we have underlined above has the force of ""shall"" in that context becausewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/12/60.html/02095959523 9/12/2THAKUR PRATAP SINGH V. SHRI KRISHNA GUPT A & ORS [12] INSC 60 (2 December 12)clause (a) of the rule reads--- ""(a) that the candidate is ineligible for election under section 14 or section 15 of theAct"".It was argued that if the candidate's ineligibility under those sections is established, then the Supervising Oï¬ƒcerhas no option but to refuse the nomination and it was said that if that is the force of the word ""may"" in a caseunder clause (a) it cannot be given a diï¬€erent meaning when clause (c) is attracted.We need not stop to consider whether this argument would be valid if section 23 had not been there because therules cannot travel beyond the Act and must be read subject to its provisions. Reading rule 9(1) (iii) (c) in the lightof section 23, all that we have to see is whether an omission to set out a candidate's occupation can be said toaï¬€ect ""the merits of the case"". We are clear it does not. Take the case of a man who has no occupation. Whatdiï¬€erence would it make whether be entered the word ""nil"" there, or struck out the word ""occupation"" or placed aline against it, or just left it blank? How is the case any diï¬€erent, so far as the merits are concerned, when a manwho has a occupation does not disclose it or misnames it, especially as a man's occupation is not one of thequaliï¬cations for the oï¬ƒce of President. We are clear that this part of the form is only directory and is part of thedescription of the candidate;, it does not go to the root of the matter so long as there is enough material in thepaper to enable him to be identiï¬ed beyond doubt.It was also argued that there was a reason for requiring the occupation to be stated, namely, because section 15(k)of the Act disqualiï¬ed any person who ""holds any oï¬ƒce of proï¬t"" under the Committee. But disclosure of acandidate's occupation would not necessarily reveal this because the occupation need only be stated in generalterms such as ""service"" or 1034 ""agriculture"" and need not be particularised; also, in any 'event, section 15 sets outother grounds of dis- qualiï¬cation which are not required to be shown in the form.As regards our earlier decision. That was a case in which the law required the satisfaction of a particular oï¬ƒcial at aparticular time about the identity of an illiterate candidate. That, we held, was the substance and said in eï¬€ect thatif the law states that A must be satisï¬ed about a particular matter, A's satisfaction cannot be replaced by that of B;still less can it be dispensed with altogether.The law we were dealing with there also required that the satisfaction should be endorsed on the nominationpaper.That we indicated was mere form and said at page 488-- ""If the Returning Oï¬ƒcer had omitted the attestationbecause of some slip on his part and it could be proved that he was satisï¬ed at the proper time, the matter mightbe diï¬€erent because the element of his satisfaction at the proper time, which is of the substance, would be there,and the omission formally to record the satisfaction could probably, in a case like that, be regarded as anunsubstantial technicality"".A number of English cases were cited before us but it will be idle to examine them because we are concerned withthe terms of section 23 of our Act and we can derive no assistance from decisions that deal with other laws made inother countries to deal with situations that do not necessarily arise in India.The appeal succeeds and is allowed with costs here and in the High Court. The order of the High Court is set asideand that of the Civil Judge restored."

High Court of Judicature at Madras (SatyanarayanaRao and Viswanatha Sastri JJ.) in Case Referred No. 67 of 1947.G. S. Pathak (G. R. Jagadisan, with him) for the appellants.M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the respondent.1953. January 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.-This appeal arises out of areference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Madras Bench, under section 21 of the Excess Proï¬ts TaxAct, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the Act).1059 The appellants are merchants carrying on business in yarn in Madura and are the sole selling agents for yarnmanufactured by the Madura Mills Co., Ltd., distributing yarn to several' constituents under forward con tracts inrespect of which they obtained advances of moneys from their constituents. During the charge able accountingperiod (13th May, 1944, to 12th 1945) the appellants received from their custom sums amounting to Rs. 7,69,569and they claimed before the Excess Proï¬ts Tax Oï¬ƒcer that the said sum should be treated as ""borrowed money""within the meaning of Rule 2-A of the Rules in the Second Schedule to the Act and, on that footing, no excessproï¬ts tax was payable by them for the chargeable accounting period. The Excess Proï¬ts Tax Oï¬ƒcer rejected theclaim and assessed them to excess proï¬ts tax of Rs. 25,404, holding that, having regard to the terms of theagreement under which the amounts were received, they could not in law be regarded as ""borrowed money""within the meaning of that Rule. Appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner 'and the Income-tax AppellateTribunal having failed, the appellants applied to the Tribunal for reference of the question of law arising in the caseto the High Court at Madras for its determination, and the Tribunal accordingly referred the following question:""Whether in the circumstances of this case, the moneys deposited by customers with the assessee ï¬rm as securitydeposits were ""borrowed money"" within the meaning of Rule 2- A of the Second Schedule to the Excess Proï¬ts TaxAct, 1940, either throughout the chargeable accounting period ended 12th April, 1945, or during any part of thatchargeable accounting period ? "" The reference was heard by a Division Bench of the Court (Satyanarayana Raoand Viswanatha Sastri JJ.) and the learned judges by their judgment dated 9th June, 1950, decided the questionagainst the appellants but granted them leave to appeal to this Court As is well known, during the period of thewar, proï¬ts arising from a trade or business were much higher 1060 than the pre-war standard of proï¬ts and theState wanted to catch a portion of such proï¬ts which it deemed to be in excess of the normal or ""standard"" proï¬ts.The Act accordingly charges a tax on the ""excess proï¬ts"" earned under war conditions and makes provision, interalia, for cases where, as here, there is an increase of capital used for purposes of the business in the chargeableaccounting period. In such cases the standard proï¬ts are to the increased by an amount calculated by applying the""statutory percentage"" (varying from 8 to 12 per cent. in diï¬€erent classes of cases) to the increase in capital. Thus,with the increase in -the capital employed in the chargeable accounting period, there would be an increase in thestandard proï¬ts and a decrease in the excess proï¬ts. Where the increase in the capital is brought about withborrowed money, it is but fair that such money,which plays its part in earning the larger proï¬ts, of which the Stateclaims a substantial share, should not be deducted in computing the average capital used for the purposes of thebusiness. Rule 2-A of the Rules in the Second Schedule to the Act accordingly provides that in computing thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/020959526 9/12/2K. M. S. LAKSHMANIER AND SONS V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX AND EXCESS PROFITS TAX, MADRAS [13] INSC â€¦average capital during the chargeable accounting period and the relative standard period ""no deduction shall bemade in respect of borrowed money"". In the present case, the appellants having admittedly received no securitydeposits during the standard period, the increase in the average capital employed in the chargeable accountingperiod would be much greater than what it has been computed to be, if the security deposits received, which wereall used for the appellants' business, were treated as borrowed money and part of the average capital of theirbusiness for the chargeable accounting period, and that, as stated above, would result in a considerable reductionof the excess proï¬ts as now assessed. What then is the true legal character of these security deposits ? The sums inquestion were received by the appelants under three diï¬€erent arrangements with their 1061 customers evidencedby the circulars issued to them. The ï¬rst of these circulars issued on 5th May, 1944, was in the following terms:"" You are quite aware of the fact that we are and will be, so long as the existing contracts of bales are closed,transferring the Contract Advance Deposit amounts to the credit of current yarn account for the bales supplied toyou then and there.Now, what we have decided in this connection is not to do so as stated above, but to keep such advance amountsunder the new heading "" Contracts Advance Fixed Deposit Account "" and return in cash or by bank's cheque or byinsured post the advance amount of the bales booked and supplied in full under certain contract number only aftercompletion of that contract with the bank's commission etc.expenses that may be incurred therein on your account.The value of the bales delivered or to be delivered for each and every time should be paid in full and this system isapplicable to our future booking of contracts only."" This was followed by another issued on 5th December, 1944,which runs thus:""This is to inform you that we have changed the heading of your "" Contracts Advance Fixed Deposit "" account into"" Security Deposit "" account. As such, we have transferred the amount which is to your credit in the former to thecredit of your latter account. This is with eï¬€ect from 1st November, 1944. Kindly note."" The arrangement wasfurther modiï¬ed by the last circular dated 14th February, 1945, which was in these terms ""Instead of calling foramounts from you towards 'Security Deposit due to bales for which we are entering into forward contracts withyou and returning the same to you from the said deposit then and there, as we are doing now, and in order tomake. it feasible, we have decided to demand from you a certain sum towards Security Deposit and keep the 1062same with -us so long as our business connection under forward contracts will continue with you.In your case, we have ï¬xed a sum of Rs for the said deposit, which amount we have to keep with us on yourapproval. Against the said amount, a sum of Rs stands credit with us now in the said deposit. Therefore, thebalance of Rs due by you to you, is to be remitted will be returned. Kindly let us have your reply immediately in thisconnection.Please note that interest of 3 per cent. per annum will be allowed as usual to the said deposit amounts until furthernotice."" It will be seen that before the 5th May, 1944, which covers the ï¬rst seven weeks of the chargeableaccounting period, the appellants had two accounts for each constituent, namely, a "" contract deposit account ""and a "" current yarn account "", crediting the moneys received from the customers in the former account andtransferring them to the yarn account in adjustment of the price of the bales supplied ,then and there"", that is, asand when deliveries were made under a contract either in installments or in full. It is clear that the amountsreceived from the customers under this arrangement were merely advance payments of the price which were tobe adjusted against the value of the bales supplied from time to time under the forward contracts and they can inno sense be regarded as borrowed money. This indeed was not disputed by Mr. Pathak.It was also conceded by him that the circular of 5th December, 1944, which merely changed the heading of theaccount in which the moneys received were credited, did not alter the legal position as it then stood. Accordingly,the question arises only with reference to the amounts received between 5th May, 1944, and 14th February, 1945,which covers the major part of the chargeable accounting period and those received thereafter till the end of thatperiod.It will be convenient to deal ï¬rst with the amounts received during the last part of that period, for, if we 1063accept the view of the learned judges below that those amounts were not borrowed money, then a fortiori mustamounts received during the second part be held not to be borrowed money.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/020959536 9/12/2K. M. S. LAKSHMANIER AND SONS V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX AND EXCESS PROFITS TAX, MADRAS [13] INSC â€¦The circular of the 14th February, 1945, marks a clear departure from the mode of dealing followed by the partiesbefore the 5th May, 1944. The amount deposited by a customer was no longer to have any relation to the priceï¬xed for the goods to be delivered under a forward contract-either in instalments or otherwise. Such price was tobe paid by the customer in full against delivery in respect of each contract without any adjustment out of thedeposit, which was to be held by the appellants as security for the due performance of his contracts by thecustomer so long as his dealings with the appellants by way of forward contracts continued, the appellants payinginterest at 3 per cent. in the meanwhile, and having, as appears from the course of dealings between the parties,the use of the money for their own business. It was only at the end of the "" business connection "" with theappellants that an adjustment was to be made towards any possible liability arising out of the customer's default.Apart from such a contingency arising, the appellants undertook to repay an equivalent amount at the terminationof the dealing. The transaction had thus all the essential elements of a contract of loan, and we accordingly holdthat the deposits received under the ï¬nal arrangement constitute borrowed money for the purpose of Rule 2-A.The learned Attorney-General laid great stress on the fact that the amounts were deposited with the object ofinducing the appellants to have dealings with the customers and for the speciï¬c purpose of being held as securityfor the due performance by the customers of their forward contracts, and that the appellants their selves ï¬xed theamount to be deposited in each case. These features, according to him, distinguished these transactions from areal borrowing or a real lending which the expression "" borrowed money "" in Rule 2-A must be taken to connote.We are unable to see how 1064 the object which the customers had in view in making the deposits can aï¬€ect theessential character of the transaction. If A pays money to B who agrees to return not the identical currency inspecie but an equivalent sum subsequently, no bailment arises but simply a loan owing by B to A. The fact that it iscalled a "" deposit "" can make no diï¬€erence. As pointed out by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in NawabMajor Sir Mohammad Akbar Khan v.Attar Singh (1), the two terms are not mutually exclusive.A deposit of money is not conï¬ned to a bailment ofspeciï¬c currency to be returned in specie. As in the case of a deposit with a banker, it does not necessarily involvethe creation of a trust but may involve only the creation of the relation of debtor. and creditor, a loan underconditions "".The fact that one of the conditions is that it is to be adjusted against a claim arising out of a possible default of thedepositor cannot alter the character of the transaction. Nor can the fact that the purpose for which the deposit ismade is to provide a security for the due performance of a collateral contract invest the deposit with a diï¬€erentcharacter. It remains a loan of which the repayment in full is conditioned by the due fulï¬llment of the obligationsunder the collateral contract.The Attorney-General placed strong reliance, as did the learned judges in the High Court, on the English decisionsin Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Port of London Authority (2 )and Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Rowntree& Co. Ltd.(3). In the ï¬rst case it was held that the stock issued by the Port of London Authority as consideration for theacquisition of the property of certain dock companies of London, which carried interest and was redeemable aftertwenty years, could not be regarded as representing "" borrowed money "" under Rule 2 of Part III of Schedule IV ofthe Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, as that expression referred to ""a real borrowing and a real lending "". The transactionwas held to be a purchase of assets for consideration in the shape of the stock issued, though it was attended (1)(1936) L R. 63 I.A. 279.(2) L.R. [ 1923] A.C. 507 (3) [ 1948] All E.R. 482.1065 with incidents in some respects similar to those which would have ensued if there had been a borrowing. maywell be conceded that the term "" borrow money "" must be construed in its natural and ordinary meaning andimplies a real borrowing and a real lending. But the holding that "" there was nothing of kind "" in the issue of stockas consideration for the purchase of certain assets, where "" no money passe directly or indirectly between theparties to the tran- saction "" is not of much assistance in determining the issue whether the security deposits nowin question involved a real borrowing and a real lending. For the reasons already indicated, we are satisï¬ed thatthey do answer to that description and constitute borrowed money within the meaning of Rule 2-A.The other case cited is still less helpful. Under certain arrangements for ï¬nancial facilities, A drew bills on B whoaccepted them and then, as an agent of A, discounted them with C and paid over the proceeds to A, who agreed toput him in funds before the maturity of the bills for paying them oï¬€. The Court of Appeal held that the money thuswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/020959546 9/12/2K. M. S. LAKSHMANIER AND SONS V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX AND EXCESS PROFITS TAX, MADRAS [13] INSC â€¦raised was not "" borrowed money "" within the meaning of paragraph 2 (1) of Part 11 of the Seventh Schedule to theFinance (No. 2) Act, 1939, which provided that "" any borrowed money shall be deducted "" (for the purpose ofExcess Proï¬ts Duty). After referring to the Port of London case (supra) as authority for the view that the words ""borrowed money "" require the existence of a borrower and a lender and that there must be a real borrowing in thelegal sense of the word, the learned judges proceeded to inquire who could be the lender, if any, in thecircumstances of the case and found there was none-not B, for an acceptor of a bill need not have any money in hishands at all to lend, not C who was only acquiring certain rights in the bill under the law merchant but was notlending money. They accordingly found it "" impossible to discover that there was such a relationship "" (of lenderand borrower) either between A and B or between A and C. In the 138 1066 present case, the relationship of lenderand borrower in all its essential features is plainly recognisable between the depositors and the appellants, andthat decision does not aï¬€ect the matter one way or the other.On the other hand, a more recent decision of the English Court of Appeal in Davies v. The Shell Company of China(1), which Mr. Pathak brought to our notice, is more in. point.A British Company, which sold petroleum products in China through Chinese agents, required the latter to depositwith the company a sum of money in Chinese dollars to be held as security against possible default by the agent inpayment for the products consigned to them and to be repaid when the agency came to an end. These depositswere, during the war, transferred to the United Kingdom for reasons of safety and were there held in sterling.Subsequently, when the Chinese dollar depreciated in relation to sterling, the amounts required to repay thedeposits in Chinese dollars were much less than the sums held by the company as sterling equivalents of thedeposits, and the question arose whether such deposits were trading receipts or receipts of a capital nature. Inholding that they were capital receipts and the proï¬t was therefore a capital gain, Jenkins L.J., who delivered theleading judgment, observed","""If the agent's deposit had in truth been a payment in advance to be applied by the company in discharging thesums from time to time due from the agent in respect of petroleum products transferred to the agent and sold byhim, the case might well be diï¬ƒcult and might well fall within the ratio decidendi of Landes Bros. v. Simpson(1)and Imperial Tobacco Co. v. Kelley.(1) But that is not the character of the de- posits here in question. The intentionmanifested by the terms of the agreement is that the deposit should be retained by the company, carrying interestfor the beneï¬t of the depositor throughout the terms of the agency. It is to be available during the (1) (1951) 32 TaxCas, I33. (3) (1943) 25 Tax Cas. 292.(2) (1934) 19 Tax Cas. 62.1067 deriod of the agency for making good the agent's pefaults in the event of any default by him; but otherwise itremains, as I see it, simply as a loan owing by the company to the agent and repayable on the termination of theagency; and I do not see how the fact that the purpose for which it is given is to provide a security against anypossible default by the agent can invest it with the character of a trading receipt."" The Attorney-General relied alsoupon certain decisions holding that security deposits received from employees were impressed with a ï¬duciarycharacter so that the depositors were entitled to preferential payments from the assignee in bankruptcy of thedepositee. He admitted, however, that there were decisions holding the other way, and we do not think itnecessary to discuss that class of cases, as the manner in which such sums have to be dealt with under theInsolvency Acts has no direct bearing on the question now under consideration.Turning now to the deposits received by the appellants from 5th May, 1944, to 14th February, 1945, we are ofopinion that, having regard to the terms of the arrangement then in force, they partake more of the nature oftrading receipts than of security deposits. It will be seen that the amounts received were treated as advancepayments in relation to each ""contract number"" and though the agreement provided for the payment of the pricein full by the customer and for the deposit being returned to him on the completion of delivery under the contract,the transaction is one providing in substance and eï¬€ect for the adjustment of the mutual obligations on thecompletion of the contract.We hold accordingly that the sums received during this period cannot be regarded as borrowed money for thepurposes of Rule 2-A.Lastly, Mr. Pathak suggested that the case having proceeded both before the Excess Proï¬ts Tax authorities andthe High Court on the footing that if the sums received from the customers during any part of the chargeableaccounting period were held to be borrowed 1068 money, they must be included in the computation of thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/020959556 9/12/2K. M. S. LAKSHMANIER AND SONS V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX AND EXCESS PROFITS TAX, MADRAS [13] INSC â€¦average proï¬ts for the whole. of the chargeable accounting period, no distinction should now be made betweenone part of the period and another for this purpose. We cannot accept that view. It is true to say that no suchdistinction was in fact made at any stage so far, but that is because it was held that none of the sums receivedunder any of the arrangements was borrowed money within the meaning of Rule 2-A. But, if it be held that the a'mounts received under one or more, but not all, of the agreements are borrowed moneys, then, obviously, thecomputation of average capital in accordance with Rule 2-A must take into account the diï¬€erent character of thesums received under each of the agreements which was in force during a part only of the chargeable accountingperiod. The form of the question referred to the court clearly recognises this and admits of a distinction beingmade, if necessary, between parts of the chargeable accounting period.In the result we set aside the order of the court below and answer the question referred in the aï¬ƒrmative withreference to the last part of the chargeable accounting period, namely, 14th February, 1945, to 12th April, 1945,and in the negative with reference to the rest of that period. We make to order as to costs.Order set aside.Agent for the appellants: Naunit Lal.Agent for the respondent: O. H. Rajadhyaksha."
