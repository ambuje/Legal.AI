# Legal.AI

We have chosen a Legal Tech idea as our 7th semester capstone project. 

The project indentifies and classifies important terminologies and entities in a contract that would further add to the automation of contract analysis and save precious time. Some of the categories are - Contract title , contract party , Date, termination date, governing law, duration/period of contract etc. 

The project also deals with collecting important information from a case document and preparing an extractive summary from it.

It has another module that generates an abstractive HEADNOTE for case documents which works on Supreme court of India's case files for the moment. We have used the SCI data from 1960-1993 to train this system.

A proposed module that we plan to go for deals with legal research in which given a master case and a set of cases we can predict the similarity of cases that can further be used to fetch precedents and similar judgements.
