January 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.----This is an appeal from thejudgment and decree passed by the late Chief Court of Oudh, aﬃrming the judgment and decree passed by theCivil Judge of Sitapur, dismissing the plaintiﬀs' suit.One, Thakur Shankar Bux Singh, proprietor of the Estate known as Rampur Kelali, situated in -District Sitapur(Oudh) was heavily indebted and the estate had been in the possession of Deputy Commissioner of Sitapur asreceiver from 1892 up to 11th July, 1901. Thereafter he was declared a disqualiﬁed proprietor under the provisionsof Section 8 (D) (1) of the U.P. Court of Wards Act (U.P. Act III of 1899) and the Court of Wards took possession ofthe estate on the 1st August, 1901. Under Section 34 of the Act he was 916 not competent to dispose his propertyby will without the consent in writing of the Court of Wards, though prior to the 1st August, 1901, he had madefour successive wills, the last being dated 19th June, 1901, under which he gave his estate absolutely to his wife.On the 30th November, 1901, he made a will giving a life interest to his wife and the remainder over to his cousinGanga Bux Singh after providing for certain legacies by way of maintenance in favour of his three daughters, hisfather's sister and his mother. The Court of Wards withheld its consent to this will which thus fell through. On the7th January, 1904, Ganga Bux Singh executed in his favour a registered deed of agreement agreeing to pay him Rs.50 per month during his lifetime with eﬀect from the month in which he would execute a will in favour of GangaBux Singh and his sons and submit the same for sanction of the Members of the Board of Revenue. A draft of thewill was accordingly prepared by him on the 18th January, 1904, under which he gave a life interest to his wife andthe residue of the property to Ganga Bux Singh and after him to his sons after providing legacies for maintenancein favour of his daughters, father's sister and mother. The Board of Revenue intimated on the 25th May, 1904, thatit would not withhold its consent to a will similar to that contained in the draft but altered in the light of theproposals contained in the further letter dated 27th April, 1904. He thereupon duly made and published a will onthe 28th July, 1904, in accordance with the suggestions contained in the Board's letter dated 25th May, 1904,cancelling all the previous wills executed by him. It appears that he handed over the original of this will to GangaBux Singh but did not give any intimation of the execution thereof to the authorities and the authorities could onlycome to know of the same when Ganga Bux Singh gave the original will to the Special Manager on or about the19th December, 1905. He appears to have changed his mind thereafter and having embraced Christianity intendedto marry a Christian woman and submitted to the Court of Wards on the 8th June, 1906, the draft of a new willwhich he 917 intended to execute in favour of his Christian wife. The Board withheld its consent to that new willand intimated on the 13th July, 1906, its refusal and also communicated thereby the withholding of its consent tothe will already executed by him on the 28th July, 1904. A further attempt by him on the 21st November, 1906, to.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/3.h/02095950951wwwiiofindirasee95tml27 9/12/2THAKURAIN RAJ RANI & ORS V. THAKUR DW ARKA NATH SINGH & ORS [13] INSC 3; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 SCR 93 (23 J…obtain the consent of the Court of Wards to another draft will was also unsuccessful and the will dated the 28thJuly, 1904, was the only last will and testament executed by him and got registered after consent obtained fromthe Court of Wards.Shankar Bux Singh died thereafter on the 28th July, 1922, and he being a Christian at the time of his deathsuccesssion to his property was governed by the Indian Succession Act. His wife got 1/3rd of the estate and theremaining 2/3rds were divided in equal shares between his surviving daughter and the son of a predeceaseddaughter of his. Mutation was eﬀected in the records of rights and the name of the widow was .shown there as theowner of the estate in his place and stead. The Court of Wards relinquished charge of the estate sometime inNovember, 1925. The widow executed on the 16th August, 1927, a deed of gift conveying the bulk of the estate toher daughter and the son of the predeceased daughter. She also executed another deed of gift in the same yearconveying the rest of the properties and on the 8th September, 1928, Ganga Bux Singh ﬁled a suit in the Court ofthe Subordinate Judge of Sitapur for a declaration that under the aforesaid will she had only a life interest in theproperty and the transfers made by her were void. This suit was contested by her and one of the defences takenwas that Ganga Bux Singh could not maintain the suit without ﬁrst obtaining letters of administration with the willannexed. This defence was upheld and the suit was dismissed on the 14th July, 1930.Ganga Bux Singh having died in the meanwhile on the 19th October, 1929, his sons applied for letters ofadministration with the will annexed on the 25th September, 1930, on the original side of the Chief Court of Oudh.This application was opposed by the 918 widow and other heirs of Shankar Bux Singh inter alia on the ground thatthe will had been executed without the sanction of the Court of Wards. Mr. Justice Kisch delivered an elaboratejudgment, negatived all the objections and granted letters of administration with the will annexed to the sons ofGanga Bux Singh on the 16th November, 1931. An appeal ﬁled by the widow and heirs of Shankar Bux Singhagainst that decision was allowed by the Bench of the Chief Court of Oudh at Lucknow on the 8th September,1933, and the orders passed by the lower court granting letters of administration with the will annexed were setaside. The sons of Ganga Bux Singh took an appeal to the Privy Council and their Lordships of the Privy Council onthe 7th May, 1937, reversed the decree of the Appeal Court and restored the decree passed by Mr. Justice Kisch.Their Lordships however observed that the only eﬀect of their decision was that letters of administration with acopy of the will annexed must be granted as prayed but that would not in any way prejudice any proceedingsagainst any of the beneﬁciaries which may be open to the respondents or any of them.On the 9th September, 1937, the widow, the daughter and the son of the predeceased daughter of Shankar BuxSingh, the plaintiﬀs, 'ﬁled the suit out of which this appeal arises, against the three sons of Ganga Bux Singh, thedefendants, for a declaration that the will dated the 28th July, 1904, was inoperative and ineﬀectual and that inany case the defendants had no right, title or interest in the properties in suit, that plaintiﬀ I was entitled to holdthe property in suit under the will of Shankar Bux Singh dated 19th June, 1901, or that the plaintiﬀs 1 to 3 wereentitled to the same as heirs-at-law of Shankar Bux Singh deceased under the provisions of the Indian SuccessionAct, and for further and other reliefs. In the plaint they alleged that the will was inoperative as Shankar Bux Singhhad no animus testandi and that it was void and inoperative in respect of the testamentary disposition in favour ofGanga 919 Bux Singh and his sons because Ganga Bux Singh failed to perform his part of the contract as regardsthe payment of monthly allowance and the defendants therefore could not take advantage of or claim any beneﬁttinder that testamentary disposition and further the payment of the said allowance being a condition precedentand the condition not having been fulﬁlled the disposition became inoperative.The defendant 3 ﬁled a written statement on the 7th February, 1938, contesting the plaintiﬀ 's claim. He contendedthat the plea as to the validity or eﬀect of the will was barred by resjudicata by virtue of the judgment of the PrivyCouncil dated 7th May, 1937. He denied that the will was executed in consideration of the agreement. He alsodenied that there was any contingent or conditional contract or any trace of the alleged condition in the whole ofthe correspondence between Shankar Bux Singh and the Board of Revenue.The learned Civil Judge, Sitapur, after considering the evidence, oral as well as documentary, led before him heldthat the will as well as the agreement formed one contract, that Ganga Bux Singh had failed to perform hispromise or his part of the contract, that the only point which was agitated before their Lordships of the PrivyCouncil was as regards the consent of the Court of Wards and that therefore even though the plaintiﬀs wereprecluded from disputing the genuineness of the will they were not precluded from seeking a declaration to theeﬀect that the defendants were not entitled to any beneﬁt under the will, and that the decision therefore did notoperate as res judicata so far as issues in the present case were concerned. He however held that the contractclearly provided a remedy for breach on the part of either party, that Shankar Bux Singh did not in fact cancel thewill and could not be said to have treated it as inoperative, that Ganga Bux Singh acquired a vested interest in the.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/3.h/02095950951wwwiiofindirasee95tml37 9/12/2THAKURAIN RAJ RANI & ORS V.

The Chief Court of Oudh negatived the contention that Shankar Bux Singhhad no animus testandi and that it was a will in form only and not in substance, holding that it was barred by resjudicata by reason of the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council. It also negatived the contention that thebequest in favour of Ganga Bux Singh was a conditional bequest or that Ganga Bux Singh having failed to fulﬁl hisobligation to pay the gujara his original character as a legatee changed into that of a trustee and he must hold thebeneﬁcial interest for the testator or his heirs. The appeal was therefore dismissed with costs. The plaintiﬀsapplied for leave to appeal to the Privy Council and the necessary certiﬁcate was granted by the Chief Court ofOudh on the 8th August, 1947.It is necessary at the outset to set out the deed of agreement and the will executed by Ganga Bux Singh andShankar Bux Singh respectively on dates the 7th January, 1904, and the 28th July, 1904. The deed of agreementdated the 7th January, 1904, ran as under:- ""Whereas, my cousin Thakur Shankar Bakhsh Singh, Taluqdar ofRampur Kalan, has proposed to make a bequest of his taluka, immovables, movables, rights etc. in favour of hiswife and, after her death in my favour and that of my sons Dwarka Nath Singh, Ajodhya Nath Singh andTirbhuwan Nath Singh, there- fore by way of consideration for this concession and favour, I, the executant, out ofmy own free will do hereby execute this agreement in favour of my cousin aforesaid that in the month in which thesaid cousin might execute the said will in my favour and that of my sons and lays the same along with anapplication before the Deputy Commissioner, Sitapur district, for sanction of the Members of the Board ofRevenue, I shall from the 1st date of the month following that month, continue to pay to my said cousin Rs. 50 incash every month during his life, so long as the said will remains in force and under this contract I make my personliable and hypothecate the same by virtue 921 of this agreement. If I, the executant, fail to perform the saidcontract the said cousin has power to have the same performed by me, the executant, through Court. If the willmentioned above executed by the said cousin, be not sanctioned by the Members of the Board of Revenue or ifunder any circumstance, the kV said cousin may himself revoke the said will, then from the time of revocation orrefusal by the Board of Revenue the said cousin shall not be entitled to receive the aforesaid monthly amount ofRs. 50 and whatever money the said cousin might have received from me, the executant, up to the said refusal orrevocation the said cousin shall necessarily be bound to refund that money to me, the executant."" The will datedthe 28th July, 1904, was executed by Shankar Bux Singh in the terms following:- "" I am Thakur Shankar Baksh aliasS. John son of Thakur Anant Singh, Taluqdar of Rampur and Grantee of Piprawan, district Sitapur. Out of my ownfree will, inclination and accord and consent I make a will that after my death my wife for her lifetime shall remainin possession of my entire Ilaqa (estate) as well as the movable and immovable property, left by me, together withthe rights etc., relating to the said properties, without the power of any sort to transfer the said properties andrights, that on the death of the said wife all the aforesaid property and the rights shall devolve on my real cousin,Ganga Bakhsh with all the proprietary powers, and that on the death of Ganga Bakhsh the said entire property andthe rights shall devolve on Dwaraka Nath, Ajodhia Nath and Tirbhuwan Nath, sons of Ganga Bakhsh, like GangaBakhsh himself, in the following shares: Dwaraka Nath annas 6, Ajodhia Nath aninas 5, Tirbhuwan Nath annas 5:and that the persons mentioned below shall continue to get the maintenance allowance (Guzara) according to theamounts and conditions noted below:- Musammat Permeshuri, my eldest daughter, married at Allahabad to theson of Rai Anant Ram, generation 922 after generation, (limited) to male issue, Rs. 100 per month;Musammat Chandrani, my younger sister, married to Rai Raghubir Bakhsh, son of Rai Kunwar Bahadur, Rais ofShahabad, district Hardoi, generation after generation (limited) to male issue, Rs. 60 per month; - Mussamat RoopRani, my real paternal aunt (father's sister), wife of Munshi Chedi Prasad deceased, Rais of Qasba Mahona, districtLucknow, generation after generation, (limited) to male issue, Rs. 45 per month;Musammat Sohni, my mother for her life, Rs. 70 per month.* * * * * Be it also known that my estate (Ilaqa) is under the Superintendence of the Court of Wards and theHon'ble Members of the Board of Revenue have granted me power to execute the will so I do hereby execute thismy last will cancelling all the previous wills executed by me' "" It is clear from the terms of the deed of agreementthat Ganga Bux Singh agreed to pay Rs. 50 in cash every month during the lifetime of Shankar Bux Singh inconsideration of Shankar Bux Singh having proposed to make a bequest of the remainder in favour of Ganga BuxSingh and his sons and that it was after the deed of agreement was got registered by Ganga Bux Singh on the 11 thJanuary, 1904, that the draft of the will was submitted on the 18th January by Shankar Bux Singh to the Court ofWards. It was this draft of the will amended as it was by the letter dated 27th April, 1904, that was engrossed in thewill which was ultimately executed on the 28th July, 1904, after the letter of sanction obtained from the Board on.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/3.h/02095950951wwwiiofindirasee95tml47 9/12/2THAKURAIN RAJ RANI & ORS V. THAKUR DW ARKA NATH SINGH & ORS [13] INSC 3; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 SCR 93 (23 J…25th May, 1904. The learned Civil Judge under the circumstances came rightly to the conclusion that the deed ofagreement and the will formed part of the same transaction, that the consideration for the will was the deed ofagreement and the consideration for the agreement was the will and that the will 923 as well as the agreementformed one contract. This ﬁnding was not challenged before the Chief Court of Oudh and could not be challengedbefore us. There was also a further ﬁnding of fact which was recorded by the learned Civil Judge and it was thatGanga Bux Singh failed and neglected to -make any payment to Shankar Bux Singh in terms of the deed ofagreement even though Shankar Bux Singh executed the will and laid the same along with the application beforethe Deputy Commissioner, Sitapur, for sanction of the Members of the Board of Revenue and that Ganga BuxSingh thus failed to perform his part of the contract. This ﬁnding also was not challenged before the Chief Court ofOudh and could not be challenged before us.The question therefore which falls to be considered by us is what is the eﬀect of the failure on the part of GangaBux Singh to make the payments to Shankar Bux Singh in terms of the deed of agreement. It was urged by Dr.Tekchand, who appeared for the plaintiﬀs before us that by reason of such non-payment and the breach ofcontract on the part of Ganga Bux Singh the will became ineﬀective and inoperative, that the payment of Rs. 50per month during the lifetime of Shankar Bux Singh was a condition precedent to the vesting of the legacy infavour of Ganga Bux Singh and that condition not having been fulﬁlled the legacy did not vest in Ganga Bux Singhand that on a true construction of the terms of the will Ganga Bux Singh acquired no vested interest in theremainder. He also urged that the scope of the Privy Council judgment was misunderstood by the Chief Court ofOudh and that both the questions as regards animus testandi and the payment of Rs. 50 per month being acondition precedent though they were barred by res judicata in regard to the due execution of the will were stillopen to him as aﬀecting the right of Ganga Bux Singh to the legacy which was provided for him by Shankar BuxSingh under the will.In regard to the last contention urged by Dr. Tekchand both the courts below were of the opinion that the questionof animus testandi was barred by res 924 judicata. It was held by their Lordships of the Privy Council that the will indispute was not revoked and that it was the last will and testament of Shankar Bux Singh. That decisionnecessarily meant that the testator when -he appended his signature to the will was in a sound and disposing stateof mind, was a free agent and 'duly executed the will in accordance with the law. The decision was conclusive asregards the testamentary capacity, due execution and the representative title of the person to whom the letters ofadministration with the will annexed were granted. It was not open therefore to the plaintiﬀs to contend that thewill which was executed by Shankar Bux Singh was a will merely in form and not in substance. The question ofanimus testandi was therefore barred by res judicata. In regard however to the question whether the bequest infavour of Ganga Bux Singh could take eﬀect by reason of default in payment the decision of the Privy Council didnot constitute res judicata and it was open to the plaintiﬀs to urge that contention. Both the courts' belowtherefore allowed the plaintiﬀs to agitate that ques- tion though they came to a conclusion adverse to theplaintiﬀs. We are of the opinion that there was no bar of res judicata and the courts below were right in allowingthe plaintiﬀs to agitate that question. The payment of Rs. 50 per month to Shankar Bux Singh during his lifetimemight be a condition precedent to the whole will coming into operation or might, be a condition precedent to thevesting of the legacy in favour of Ganga Bux Singh. If the plaintiﬀs urged the former position that plea wouldcertainly be barred by res judicata. No court would grant a probate or letters of administration with the willannexed in regard to a will which has ceased to be operative and was a mere scrap of paper. The plaintiﬀs couldnot therefore be heard to say that 'by reason of the non-fulﬁlment of the condition precedent the whole will hadbecome inoperative, for that would run counter to the decision of the Privy Council. Even on merits such a positionwould be untenable for the simple reason that besides 925 Ganga Bux Singh there was the widow, who was given alife interest and there were the three daughters, the father's sister and the mother who were given legacies by wayof maintenance and they were certainly not guilty of non- fulﬁlment of any condition precedent. The will wouldcertainly therefore stand so far as they were concerned and the whole eﬀect of the non-fulﬁlment of the conditionprecedent qua Ganga Bux Singh would be to prevent the vesting of the legacy in his favour.The latter position therefore would be available to the plaintiﬀs and they could contend that by reason of the non-fulﬁlment of the condition precedent by Ganga Bux Singh the legacy provided in his favour did not vest in him. Ifthe payment of Rs. 50 per month therefore constituted a condition precedent the plaintiﬀs were on ﬁrm groundand that position could not and was not contested before us by the learned counsel appearing for the defendants.It therefore remains to be considered whether the payment of Rs. 50 pet month to Shankar Bux Singh during hislifetime constituted a condition precedent to the vesting of the legacy in favour of Ganga Bux Singh..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/3.h/02095950951wwwiiofindirasee95tml57 9/12/2THAKURAIN RAJ RANI & ORS V. THAKUR DW ARKA NATH SINGH & ORS [13] INSC 3; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 SCR 93 (23 J…There is no doubt, as held by the learned Civil Judge, that the consideration for the will was the deed of agreementand the consideration for the agreement was the will and that the will as well as the agreement formed onecontract. But for Ganga Bux Singh having executed the deed of agreement Shankar Bux Singh would not haveforwarded the draft will to the Court of Wards for its sanction and he would also not have executed the will on the28th July, 1904. The contract was an overall contract under which both the parties had to perform their respectiveobligations. The obligation on the part of Ganga Bux Sigh was to execute the deed of agreement, agreeing to paythe moneys to Shankar Bux Singh in accordance with the terms thereof. The obligation on the part of Shankar BuxSingh was to execute the will and submit it to the Court of Wards for its sanction. Both these obligations werefulﬁlled by the parties and the two documents were supported by consideration and became binding 926 on boththe parties. The nonperformance of the agreement to pay by Ganga Bux Singh constituted at best a failure. tofulﬁl his obligation and Shankar Bux Singh became entitled to pursue his rights and remedies against Ganga BuxSingh by reason of the breach of contract by him.It was urged by Dr. Tekchand that the consideration here constituted a condition precedent and that the non-payment of Rs. 50 per month by Ganga Bux Singh constituted non- fulﬁlment of condition precedent.He relied upon the observations of Chief Justice Wills in Acherley v. Vernon, 125 English Reports 1106 at page 1108(Willes 153 at page 156):"" I know of no words that either in a will or deed necessarily make a condition precedent, but the same words willeither make a condition precedent or subsequent according to the nature of the thing and the intent of the parties.If therefore a man devise one thing in lieu and consideration of another, or agree to do anything or pay a sum ofmoney in consideration of anything to be done, in these cases that which is the consideration is looked upon as acondition precedent. So is the case of Peters v. Opie, I Ventr. 177, and I Saund. 350. If a man agree to pay a sum ofmoney to another pro labore suo in pulling down a house, the pulling down of the house is a condition precedent.So is the case of Thorpe and Thorpe. I Salk. 171, where a man agreed to pay a sum of money to another hereleasing the equity of redemption in certain lands. And so is the case of Turner v. Goodwin, adjudged by LordMacclesﬁeld and the rest of the Judges of B. R. upon great consideration, P. 13 Anne, in which case Goodwin was topay Turner 15001. be assigning a judgment. In all which cases it was holden that the party who was to receive themoney was not entitled to demand it until he had performed that which was the consideration of the payment,and which was considered in all these cases to be in the nature of a condition prece- dent.* * * * 927 So likewise if it plainly appear to be the intent of the testator that the devise shall not have the beneﬁtof the devise unless he perform a certain act enjoined him by the devisor, this is a condition precedent; and thedevisee shall have no beneﬁt of the devise until he perform it, even though the condition be never so unreasonableif it be not illegal or impossible; for cujus est dare ejus est disponere."" These observations were particularly reliedupon by Dr.Tekehand in support of his contention that the payment of Rs. 50 per month to Shankar Bux Singh during hislifetime constituted a condition precedent to the vesting of the legacy in favour of Ganga Bux Singh.While recognising the force of these observations we are constrained to observe that the terms of the deed ofagreement negative any such contention. The agreement itself provided what was to happen if payment was not-made in accordance with the terms thereof. If Ganga Bux Singh failed to perform the contract Shankar Bux Singhwas to have the power to have the same performed by Ganga Bux Singh through Court. This consequence couldnot be contemplated if the payment constituted a condition precedent and the non-fulﬁlment of the conditionprecedent was to have the eﬀect of rendering the agreement inoperative. In that event the agreement itself wouldbecome inoperative and no rights under the agreement would survive to Shankar Bux Singh. The right which wastherefore given to Shankar Bux Singh to have the agreement performed by Ganga Bux Singh contemplated theexistence and the continued existence of the agreement so as to enable Shankar Bux Singh to hold Ganga BuxSingh to its performance, The continued existence of the contract was in contemplation of the parties and so far asGanga Bux Singh is concerned it was at no stage contemplated that he could forego the performance of theobligation on his part to pay Rs. 50 per month to Shankar Bux Singh during his lifetime so long as the will stoodunrevoked.928 It is signiﬁcant to observe on the other hand that two events were contemplated so far as Shankar Bux Singhhimself was concerned. The one was the withholding of the consent of the Court of Wards and the other was therevocation of the will by Shankar Bux Singh himself. The sum of Rs. 50 per month was agreed to be paid by GangaBux Singh to him from the month when Shankar Bux Singh executed the will and laid it before the Court of Wards.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/3.h/02095950951wwwiiofindirasee95tml67 9/12/2THAKURAIN RAJ RANI & ORS V. THAKUR DW ARKA NATH SINGH & ORS [13] INSC 3; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 SCR 93 (23 J…for its sanction. The Court of Wards might withhold its consent to the will and in that event whatever paymentswere made during the interval by Ganga Bux Singh to Shankar Bux Singh had to be refunded by the latter. Eventhough the Court of Wards might sanction the will Shankar Bux Singh might later on revoke the will and theconsequence of such revocation was also provided in that Shankar Bux Singh was to refund to Ganga Bux Singhthe amounts which he had paid up to the time of revocation to Shankar Bux Singh in accordance with the terms ofthe agreement. It has to be observed moreover that all these constituted independent obligations on the part ofboth the parties. The obligation on the part of Ganga Bux Singh was so long as the will stood unrevoked to pay toShankar Bux Singh Rs. 50 per month during his lifetime and the obligation on the part of Shankar Bux Singh was toobtain the consent of the Court of Wards and to leave the will unrevoked during his lifetime. These obligationswere independent of each other and the consequences of the non- performance of these obligations on the part ofeach of the parties were expressly provided in the agreement itself. It could not therefore be contended that thepayment of Rs. 50 per month to Shankar Bux Singh during his lifetime constituted a condition precedent to thevesting of the legacy in his favour. That was merely a consideration provided by Ganga Bux Singh for the executionof the will by Shankar Bux Singh in his favour and if Ganga Bux Singh committed a breach of the agreement theonly result was that Shankar Bux Singh would become entitled to recover the amount due on such default 929from Ganga Bux Singh by having recourse to a court of law.The contract would continue to subsist, the parties being relegated to their rights and remedies thereunder ascontemplated by the parties.In spite of the non-payment by Ganga Bux Singh of the sum of Rs. 50 per month to Shankar Bux Singh inaccordance with the terms of the agreement at no time did Shankar Bux Singh revoke the will nor did he pursueGanga Bux Singh in a court of law for the recovery of the amounts in respect of which Ganga Bux Singh was indefault. He left the will unrevoked and on his death the will became eﬀective as his last will and testament andoperated to vest in Ganga Bux Singh ail interest in the remainder as therein provided. There is nothing in the willitself which in terms makes the bequest conditional on regular payment of the amount under the agreement.The argument which was advanced by Dr. Tekchand based on section 81 of the Indian Trusts Act could not availhim for the simple reason that the intention of Shankar Bux Singh had to be gathered as on the date of theexecution of the will and not at any subsequent time thereafter. That intention was clearly to eﬀect a testamentarydisposition of the remainder in favour of Ganga Bux Singh. It was certainly farthest from the thought of ShankarBux Singh not to dispose of the beneﬁcial interest in the remainder in favour of Ganga Bux Singh with the resultthat there could neither be a secret trust nor a trust of imperfect obligation created in favour of the heirs at law ofthe testator Shankar Bux Singh. The argument of Dr. Tekchand that the remainder did not vest in Ganga Bux Singhbut fell into residue by reason of his having predeceased the widow of Shankar Bux Singh is equally of no avail. Thelegacy in favour of Ganga Bux Singh was a legacy of the remainder of the estate which vested in Ganga Bux Singhbut was deferred in possession till after the extinction of the life interest created in favour of the plaintiﬀ 1. Suchvested interest could devolve upon the defendants, the heirs and legal representatives of 120 930 Ganga Bux Singhon the death of the latter and the -defendants were therefore as the heirs and legal repre sentatives of Ganga BuxSingh since deceased rightly entitled to the same. As the bequest was not conditional and did not lapse therecould be no question of any resulting trust or of any intestacy with respect to the remainder.The result therefore is that the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.Agent for the appellants"

In default,after the expiry of the said period action will be taken according to law, and thereafter no plea shall beentertained."" The requisition not having been complied with, the landlords evidently ﬁled a suit being Suit No. 590of 1859. The pleadings in this suit are not on the record. On 21st September, 1860, the Principal Sudder Amindelivered his judgment, Exhibit 24. It appears from that judgment that the following two issues had been framed:-"" 1. Whether the plaintiﬀs have served notice on the other party for assessment of Jama ?2. Whether a Jama can be assessed in respect of the disputed lands; if so at what rate?"" The Principal Sudder Aminoverruling the objection of the defendants held that the landlords had full power to assess the rent andaccordingly he ﬁxed the rent at Rs. 2 per Cotta which worked out at Rs. 78 in respect of the entire land. There wasan appeal from that decision which, however, was dismissed by the judgment Exhibit Z (2) delivered on the 18thMarch, 1862 . The Mourashi Patta relied upon was rejected as 935 it was not registered and appeared, onexamination, to have been newly written and ﬁled. Thereafter the landlord ﬁled a suit for rent of the disputedlands# against Dobson and Exhibits Z and Z (1) are the certiﬁed copies of the judgment and order - passedthereon. On the 29th May, 1866, Dobson executed two mortgages (Exhibits P/6 and P/7) in favour of De Rozarioand John Dominic Freitas for Rs. 4,000 and Rs, 2,000 respectively. The two re-conveyances dated 29th February,1874, and 12th March, 1874, are also on the record. On 6th March, 1874, Dobson sold the premises to HenryCharles Mann by a deed which is Exhibit P/5. The consideration for the sale was Rs. 9,500. It appears from thisdeed that by that time there were two brick-built dwelling houses on the property which came to be numbered asNos. 2 and 3, Watkin's Lane. On 11th September, 1883, Henry Charles Mann sold the premises to George Jones forRs.10,000: vide Exhibit P/4. In both those sale deeds the transferee is granted a heritable right forever. In theassessment books of the Howrah Municipality (Exhibits 22 series) the interest of George Jones is described asMourashi. In the landlord's Sherista the nature of the tenancy is not stated and Dobson continues to be therecorded tenant (Exhibit D series). There was, however, no column. in the rent receipts to indicate the status of thetenant. It appears that on the death of George Jones the estate came into the hands of the Administrator-Generalof Bengal representing the estate of George Jones. In the rent receipts of Dighapatia Raj the rent is said to be""received from Jones--Administrator-General of Bengal."" In May, 1931, the plaintiﬀ and the Administrator-Generalof Bengal entered into an agreement for sale of premises No. 2, Watkin's Lane, being a portion of the premises inquestion, for a sum of Rs. 10,001 and Rs. 1,001 was paid by the plaintiﬀ as and by way of earnest money. Thelandlords having declined to subdivide the ground rent between the two portions of the premises, namely, Nos. 2and 3, Watkin's Lane, and a portion of the Premises No. 2, Watkin's Lane, having fallen down the 936 agreementfor sale appears to have fallen through. On the 4th June, 1932, the plaintiﬀ suggested that a lease for 20 yearsshould be granted which was refused by the Administrator-General, Bengal. Then there was some negotiationbetween the plaintiﬀ and the Administrator- General of Bengal for the sale of both the premises, Nos. 2 and 3,Watkin's Lane, to the plaintiﬀ for a sum of Rs.12,500. The plaintiﬀ on 9th April, 1933, sent a draft deed of sale (Exhibit 15) for the approval of the Administrator-General of Bengal describing the premises as a Mokarari Mourashi homestead. On 21st April, 1933, Dighapatia RajEstate wrote to the Administrator-General. of Bengal saying that the tenancy was a Ticca one. On 6th June, 1933,the Administrator-General of Bengal declined to approve the draft as drawn. After some further proposal by theplaintiﬀ for a long lease he declined to purchase the property on the ground that the Administrator-General ofBengal had not a good marketable title. Nothing having come out of the negotiations between the plaintiﬀ andthe Administrator-General of Bengal the latter in September, 1936, invited oﬀers for sale of the lands (Exhibit B).The defendant No. I made the highest oﬀer of Rs. 12,251. and this was accepted by the Administrator-General inpreference to the oﬀer made by the plaintiﬀ for Rs. 11,251. The Administrator-General accordingly executed aconveyance in favour of the defendant Pratul Chandra Ghose (Exhibit P. X) who thereupon became the tenant ofthe premises. Having failed to obtain title to the premises from the Administrator-General of Bengal the plaintiﬀapproached the landlords and on 22nd September, 1937, obtained a Mokarari Mourashi Patta in respect of thedisputed land on payment of a Selami of Rs. 3,205 and at an annual rent of Rs. 78 only.The defendant Pratul Chandra Ghose ﬁled rent suits against the plaintiﬀ in respect of the underlease held by thelatter under the Administrator-General of Bengal and obtained rent decrees. The plaintiﬀ, however, on thestrength of his new title derived from the superior landlords under the Mourashi Patta served 937 notice on thedefendant Pratul Chandra Ghose on the 7th October, 1937, requiring him to vacate the premises on the last day ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/4.html/9595595959535 9/12/ 2020BEJOY GOP AL MUKHERJI V . PRATUL CHANDRA GHOSE [13] INSC 4; AIR 13 SC 13; 13 SCR 930 (28 January 13)the month of Chaitra 1944 B. S. The defendant Pratul Chandra Ghose, not having vacated the premises, theplaintiﬀ ﬁled the suit out of which the present appeal has arisen.Shri N. C. Chatterjee contends that in view of the decision in the suit of 1859 it was not open to the defendantPratul Chandra Ghose to contend that his tenancy was a heritable permanent tenancy. This point was neitherpleaded nor raised in the trial Court but was put forward for the ﬁrst time before the High Court. The pleadings ofthe 1859 suit are not on the record but the substance of ' the written statement appears from the judgment Exhibit24 passed in that case. The issues framed in that case have already been set out. There was no issue regarding thecharacter of the tenancy, namely, whether it was permanent and heritable or otherwise. The only question therewas whether rent could be assessed tinder the Regulation. There is nothing in that Regulation suggesting that rentcould be assessed only if the tenancy was a ticca tenancy or that rent could not be assessed if the tenancy was apermanent one. The question of permanency of the tenancy was not, therefore, directly or substantially in issue.We ﬁnd ourselves in agreement with the High Court that the permanency of tenure does not necessarily implyboth ﬁxity of rent and ﬁxity of occupation. The fact of enhancement of rent in 1859 may be a circumstance to betaken into consideration but it does not necessarily militate against the tenancy being a permanent one, as held bythe Privy Council in the case of an agricultural tenancy in Shankarrao v. Sambhu Wallad(l).The principle of that decision was applied also to non- agricultural tenancies in Jogendra Krishna Banerji v. Sm.Subashini Dassi(2). In Probhas Chandra Mallik v. Debendra Nath Das(3) also the same view was taken. We,therefore, hold that the plea of res judicata cannot be sustained.(1) (1940) 45 C.W.N. 57.(2) (1940) C.W.N. 590. (3) (1939) 43 C.W.N, 828, 121 938 Shri N. C. Chatterjee then contends, relying on thedecisions in Rasmoy Purkatt v. Srinath Moyra (1), Digbijoy Roy v. Shaikh Aya Rahman (2), Satyendra Nath v. CharuSankar (3 ) and Kamal Kumar Datta v. Nanda Lal Dule ( 4 ) that the tenancy in this case cannot be regarded as apermanent one.The decisions in those cases have to be read in the light of the facts of those particular cases. The mere fact of renthaving been received from a certain person may not, as held in Rasamoy Purkatt v. Srinath Moyra (supra) andDigbijoy Roy v. Shaikh Aya Rahman (supra), amount to a recognition of that person as a tenant. Mere possessionfor generations at a uniform rent or construction of permanent structure by itself may not be conclusive proof of apermanent right as held in Kamal Kumar Dutt v. Nanda Lal Dule (supra) but the cumulative eﬀect of such factcoupled with several other facts may lead to the inference of a permanent tenancy as indicated even in the case ofSatyendra Nath v. Charu Sankar (supra) on which Shri N. C. Chatterjee relies. What, then, are the salient factsbefore us ? It is not known how the earliest known tenant Shaik Manik acquired the tenancy or what the nature ofthat tenancy was. The tenancy has passed from one person to another by inheritance or by will or by transfersinter vivos. In the deeds of transfer the transferee has been given the right to enjoy the property from generationto generation for ever. A tank has been excavated and a pucca ghat built on the land. Bricks have beenmanufactured with the earth taken from the land and the premises have been enclosed within pucca walls. Puccabuildings have been erected and mortgages have been executed for substantial amounts. Although there was anenhancement of rent in 1860 that rent has continued to be paid ever since then. Portion of the premises, namely,No. 2, Watkin's Lane, has been used as a factory by the plaintiﬀs and on the other portion, namely, No. 3, Watkin'sLane, residential buildings were -erected which indicate that the lease was for residential purposes. As already (1) 7C.W.N. 132 (2) 17 C.W.N. 156.(3) 40 C.W.N. 854.(4) (1929) I.L.R. 56 Cal. 738.939 indicated there have been many transfers and devolutions and the landlords have accepted rent' from thetransferees or the successors. The names of Mrs. Cynthia Mills and Dobson and, Jones were mutated in theZamindar's Sherista.Although in the rent receipts Dobson continued to be shown as the recorded tenant, eventually Jones's nameappears on the rent receipts as tenant. In spite of the increase in land value and the letting value the landlordsthrough whom the plaintiﬀ derives his title did not at any time make may attempt to eject the tenant or to get anyfurther enhancement of rent since 1860. All these circumstances put together are explicable only on thehypothesis of permanency of the tenure and they irresistibly lead to the conclusion, as held by the lower Courts,www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/4.html/9595595959545 9/12/ 2020BEJOY GOP AL MUKHERJI V .

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J. - This is an appeal by the plaintiﬀ ' in anejectment suit. His case was that defendant No. I Pratul Chandra Ghose was a Ticca tenant of premises Nos. 2 and3, Watkin's Lane, Howrah, comprising an area of I Bigha 19 Cottahs of land on a rent of Rs. 78 per annum under thelandlords Kumar Sarat Kumar Roy and Bibhuti Bhusan Chatterjee, proform a defendants Nos. 2 and 3, that theplaintiﬀ took a Mourashi Mokarari lease from these landlords on the 23rd September, 1937, and thereby becamethe immediate landlord of the said defendant and that the teancy was determined by a notice to quit dated the 7thOctober, 1937. The trial Court, amongst other 932 things, found as a fact that the tenancy of the defendant PratulChandra Ghose was permanent, heritable and transferable and was not liable to be determined by notice.The plaintiﬀ preferred an appeal to the High Court but the High Court dismissed that appeal holding, amongstother things, that the ﬁnding of the trial Court as to the nature of the tenancy was correct. The plaintiﬀ has nowcome up on appeal before us after getting a certiﬁcate from the High Court that it is a ﬁt case for appeal to thisCourt.Relying on the decision of the Privy Council in Dhanna Mal v. Moti Sagar(1) Shri N. C. Chatterjee appearing onbehalf of the plaintiﬀ-appellant contends that the present appeal is not concluded by the concurrent ﬁnding of theCourts below that the tenancy was permanent because that question was one of the proper inference in law to bededuced from the facts as found by the Courts below. The learned counsel has, therefore, taken us through. theevidence mostly documentary, as to the nature of the tenancy. The earliest document referred to is Exhibit P/11,being a conveyance executed in 1226 B.S.1819-1820 by Sheikh Manik and another in favour of Mrs. Cynthia MillsJunior. How the vendors had acquired their title is not known. By that deed of sale the vendors, for a moneyconsideration,, conveyed their interest in the lands described as Jamai lands to the purchaser who, on payment ofrent of Rs. 480 per kist, was to ""go on possessing and enjoying the same with great felicity down to your sons andgrandsons etc., in succession by constructing houses and structures."" Mrs. Cynthia Mills died some time beforeOctober, 1855, and her son John Henry Mills who had succeeded her sold the premises to one Mrs. Sabina Love bya conveyance Exhibit P/10 dated the 29th October, 1855. It appears from that deed that by that time a tank withmasonry steps had been excavated on the lands which were described as a plot of rentpaying garden land. Theconsideration for the sale (1) (1927) L. R. 54 1. A. 178.933 was Rs. 1,000. The following provisions of the sale deed are of importance:-- ""From this date being entitled tomake gift and sale of the said property, you do bring into your own possession the said lands etc., and on payingannually to the Maliks Zemindars Rs. 480 (Rupees-four and annas eight) in Siccas coins as rent and on getting yourname mutated in place of mine and obtaining Dakhilas in your own name, you do go on possessing and enjoyingthe same with great felicity down to your sons and grandsons etc., in succession."" By a conveyance Exhibit P/9,dated the 10th October, 1856, Mrs. Sabina Love transferred the premises to one Francis Horatio Dobson. Thepremises were there described as ""garden land held under Mourashi Patta"" which Patta has since been held to be aspurious document in a subsequent litigation. It appears from this document that Mrs. Cynthia Mills had excavateda tank and constructed a pucca ghat and laid out a garden and that on her death her son and heir John Henry Millscame into possession of the land and that he had sold the premises to Mrs. Sabina Love and that after herpurchase Mrs. Sabina Love had enclosed the said lands and had manufactured bricks with the earth of the land shepurchased.

R & Co., collectedthe amounts of the bills from the purchasers on behalf of the company and credited the sums realised in thecompany's account with banks at Ahmedabad and also disbursed them to creditors of the company in BritishIndia. These payments were credited by the company to R & Co. During the relevant accounting year the companythus received Rs. 12,68,480. The company also received Rs. 4,40,878 from sales to purchasers in British India.

The taxation in such cases is not on income, proﬁtsor gains which were received but on proﬁts which ""accrued or arose"" to the assessee in the accounting year.

Jagmohandas Ramanlal & Co.......................Rs. 12,68,480 (b) Saleproceeds through British Indian banks and shroﬀs rec eived by means of drafts or hu ndies drawn by thecompany...........Rs. 4,40,878 (Railway receipts handed over to British Indian merchants by the banks on payment).(c) Sale proceeds received by cheques on British Indian banks and hundies on British Indian shroﬀs and merchants,and collected by the banks and shroﬀs .................................. Rs. 6,719735 Total Rs. 23,81,093 As regards item (a)the company debited the account of the ﬁrm of Messrs. Jagmohandas Ramalal & Co. with Rs.13,41,744 which represented sales made by the company to merchants of Ahmedabad whose payments wereguaranteed by that ﬁrm, and credited the sales account with the amount of the bills. Messrs. JagmohandasRamanlal & Co. collected the amounts of the bills from the merchants at Ahmedabad and credited the sumsrecovered in the company's accounts with banks and/or shroﬀs at Ahmedabad and also made dis- bursementsunder instructions of the company to the creditors of the company in British India. All these payments werecredited by the company to the account of Messrs. Jagmohandas Ramanlal & Co. and during the relevantaccounting year the company thus 954 received Rs. 12,68,480 against the total debits of Rs.13,41,744.As regards item (b) the company received Rs. 4,40.878 by drawing hundies or drafts for the amounts of its salesbills (including the forwarding charges and the cost of transit from the mills premises to the station) on themerchants in favour of recoginised banks and shroﬀs in British India, by sending the same to those banks or shroﬀswith the railway receipts duly endorsed in favour of the merchants and by instructing the banks or shroﬀs torecover the amounts including the costs of transmitting the same to them. The amounts of these sales bills weredebited by the company to the accounts of the respective merchants and credited to the sales account and thesums recovered by the banks or shroﬀs from the merchants in British India against the delivery of the relativerailway receipts were on receipt of the same by the company credited to the accounts of the respective merchantsin their books of account.As regards item (c), the company received Rs. 6,71,735 from the merchants by cheques and hundies drawn onbanks and shroﬀs in British India in favour of the company. These cheques and hundies were negotiated by thecompany in Petlad and sent back for credit to its accounts with those banks and shroﬀs. The said cheques andhundies were cashed in British India and the sale proceeds remitted by the banks and shroﬀs to the company. Theamounts of the sales bills were debited to the accounts of the merchants in the books of the company when thegoods were invoiced to the merchants and these accounts were credited with the moneys thus received by thecompany from the merchants.The Income-tax Oﬃcer brought to tax the proﬁts derived by the company represented by the said three items inthe assessment year on the basis that the sale proceeds having been received in British India the proﬁts werereceived in British India. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner on appeal held that proﬁts 955 from items (a) and(c) were exempt from British Indian tax while those represented by item (b) were rightly taxed. The Departmentﬁled an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal against the decision of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in regard toitems (a) and (c) and the company ﬁled an appeal in respect of item (b). The Appellate Tribunal held in regard toitem (a) that the merchants in British India were not absolved either in law or in fact from their responsibility to payto the company its dues by virtue of the debit entries in the account of Messrs. Jagmohandas Rainanlal & Co. andin regard to item (b) that the payment of the amounts due was a condition precedent to' the delivery of goods bythe banks in British India on behalf of the company. The Tribunal therefore held that proﬁts arising from items (a)and (b) were rightly subjected to tax. As regards item (c) the Tribunal held that Rs.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html3/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD. V.

The amounts were received at Petlad and once they were received there,they could not be held to have been received again in British India "".The Department asked the Tribunal to refer to the High Court the question of law arising on item (c) and thecompany asked the Tribunal to refer to the High Court the question of law arising on items (a) and (b) and theTribunal therefore referred the following question of law to the High Court:- "" Whether on the facts and in thecircumstances of the case, the sums of Rs. 12,68,480, Rs. 4,40,878 and Rs. 6,71,735, or any of them, which,represents receipts by the assessee company of its sale proceeds in British India, include any portion of its incomein British India?"" The High Court held that Rs. 12,68,480 were received in British India and included the proﬁts andgains of the business of the assessee company. It held that Rs. 4,40,878 also were received in British India 956 andthe company was liable in respect of that amount. In regard to the item of Rs. 6,71,735, the High Court found thatthe facts stated by the Tribunal were not suﬃcient to enable it to reach a decision and therefore directed that theTribunal should submit a supplementary statement of case setting out the several aspects set out in the judgment.The High Court reframed the question in regard to the two items of Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878 in the mannerfollowing:- (1)Whether the sums of Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878 were sale proceeds of the goods sold by theassessee to merchants in British India or were debts due by the said merchants ? (2)Whether if they were saleproceeds, they were received in British India ? and answered them by stating that they were sale proceeds andthey were received in British India. There was also a third question which was comprised in the reference and thatquestion was framed as under:- Whether the proﬁts of the assessee's business are included in the sums of Rs.12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878 ? This question was also answered by stating that they were included in these twosums. The company obtained leave from the High Court to appeal against the decision in regard to the two sumsof Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878 and hence this appeal.It is common ground that the company is a nonresident and its accounts have been regularly kept according tothe, mercantile system. Its balance sheets were also prepared on that basis. The company was assessed to tax inBritish India on the basis that these two sums of money were received in British India by or on behalf of thecompany.In regard to the item of Rs. 12,68,480, even though the amounts of the sales bills were in the ﬁrst instance debitedby the company in its books to the account of Messrs. Jagmohandas Ramanlal & Co. the sale proceeds inaccordance with 957 the terms of the sales bills were paid by the respective merchants to Messrs. JagmohandasRamanlal & Co. in British India and were either credited by Messrs. Jagmohandas Ramanlal & Co. in the company'saccounts with banks or shroﬀs in British India or were disbursed by them in accordance with the instructions of thecompany in British India. In regard to the item of Rs. 4,40,878 even though the amounts of the sales bills weredebited in the ﬁrst instance by the company to the accounts of the respective merchants in the books of accountat Petlad the relative railway receipts were sent by the company to banks or shroﬀs in British India together withdrafts or hundies in connection with the same with instructions that delivery of the railway receipts should begiven to the respective merchants against payment and the amounts of the sales bills were thus paid by therespective merchants to the banks or shroﬀs in British India and were transmitted under the instructions of thecompany by the banks and shroﬀs in British India to the company at Petlad. Prima facie therefore the amounts ofthe sales bills in both the cases whether they were paid to Messrs. Jagmohandas Ramanlal & Co. or to the banks orshroﬀs, through whom the railway receipts were negotiated were paid by the merchants in British India and werereceived by Messrs. Jagmohandas Ramanlal & Co. and the banks or shroﬀs on behalf of the company,in BritishIndia. The receipt of these amounts thus fell within section 4 (1) (a) of the Act and the proﬁts or gains of thisbusiness thus were received in British India by or on behalf of the company.The company however sought exemption from liability to tax on the grounds (a) that the accounts of the companywere kept on the mercantile or book proﬁt basis under which the accrual of proﬁt as shown in the account was thecriterion of taxability and section 4(l) (a) had no application at all; (b) that it was obligatory on the authorities undersection 13 of the Act to accept that system of maintaining accounts except under the proviso to that section andthat the method of computation there was made the very basis of 124 958 chargeability and section 10 read withsection 13 operated to save these amounts from chargeability and (c) that the amounts having been treated asreceived when credit entries were made in the books of account, and chargeability having crystallised on the datewhen the income accrued or was treated as received, there was no further scope for a charge when the amountswere subsequently actually received and the subsequent handling of the amounts by the company and the receiptthereof in British India were of no consequence.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html4/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY [1953] INSC 6; AIR 1953 SC 187; 1953 SCR 950 (30 Janua…The mercantile system of accounting or what is otherwise known as the double entry system is opposed. to thecash system of book keeping under which a record is kept of actual cash receipts and actual cash payments, entriesbeing made only when money is actually collected or disbursed.That system brings into credit what is due, immediately it becomes legally due and before it is actually receivedand it brings into debit expenditure the amount for which a legal liability has been incurred before it is actuallydisbursed. The proﬁts or gains of the business which are thus credited are not realised but having been earned aretreated as received though in fact there is nothing more than an accrual or arising of the proﬁts at that stage.They are book proﬁts. Receipt being not the sole test of chargeability and proﬁts and gains that have accrued orarisen or are deemed to have accrued or arisen being also liable to be charged for income-tax, the assessability ofthese proﬁts which are thus credited in the books of account arises not because they are received but because.they have accrued or arisen.Mr. Kolah appearing for the company drew our attention to the following cases:- Subramaniyan Chettiar v.Commissioner of Incometax(1), Ahmed Din Alladitta v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Punjab(2), Kanwal NayanHamir Singh v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Ajmer-Merwara(3) and (1)(1927) 2 I.T.C. 365.(2)[ 1934] 2 I.T.R. 369.(3) [ 1938] 6 I.T.R. 675.959 Commissioner of Income-tax v. Shrimati Singari Bai(1).The assessees there were all residents in British India and maintained their books of account according to themercantile system. Except in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Singari Bai(1) where the assessment wasin respect of the total income or proﬁts, stray items of income treated as received in British India were sought tobe charged for tax and they were all assessed for tax not on the basis of actual receipts in British India but on thebasis of their having accrued or arisen in British India.The cases were decided with reference to the law as it stood before the amendment in 1939 which under section4(l) rendered liable to tax all income, proﬁts or gains from whatever source derived, accruing or arising or receivedin British India or deemed under the provisions of the Act to accrue, arise or to be received in British India. Thequestion that arose for the determination of the courts was whether under the mercantile system, proﬁts whichwere credited in the books could be taxed even though they had in fact not been received and the conclusionreached by the courts was that these proﬁts credited in the books of account were earned and could be charged ashaving accrued or arisen within British India even though they were in fact not received. In none of these caseswere the courts con- cerned with a non-resident claiming to have received proﬁts or gains outside British Indiaunder the mercantile system of accounting and claiming exemption from liability to tax under section 4 (1) (a) inrespect of proﬁts actually received in British India.It follows from the above that the mercantile system of accounting treats proﬁts or gains as arising or accruing atthe date of the transaction notwithstanding the fact that they are not received or deemed to be received andunder that system, book proﬁts are, assessed as liable to tax.If an assessee therefore regularly adopts the mercantile system of accounting he would be liable to tax on theproﬁts thus credited by (1)..[ 1945] 13 I.T.R. 224.960 him in his books of account subject to all deductions for bad debts as provided in section 10 (2) (xi). Section 4(1) (a) has nothing to do with this basis of taxation. Section 13 which is an integral part of the computation of thetotal income of the assessee and is compulsory on the income-tax authorities as well when computing the totalincome (vide section 2 (15) ) does not lay down any exemption from liability. It only sets up a mode of computationof the income which is liable to assessment and imposes upon the income-tax authorities an obligation to acceptthe mode of accounting regularly adopted by the assessee except in the cases where the proviso to that sectioncomes into operation. The proﬁts earned and credited in the books of account being thus taken as the basis ofcomputation, the system of accounting postulates the existence of debts in so far as moneys re ain due andpayable by the parties to whom they have been debited and when it is realised that these debts are notrecoverable the assessee gets a deduction for the bad debts under section 10 (2) (xi). This however does not meanthat the transaction as it has been recorded in the books of account under the mercantile system of accounting orwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html5/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY [1953] INSC 6; AIR 1953 SC 187; 1953 SCR 950 (30 Janua…the double entry system is metamorphosed or the relationship between the parties assumes a diﬀerent character.What was in its inception a transaction of sale and purchase is not converted into another transaction as betweencreditor and debtor. The relationship as between vendor and purchaser still subsists and there does not come intoexistence a new relationship as between creditor and debtor with all its necessary consequences. The transactionas it has been recorded in the books of account has got to be worked out to its fullest extent. Merely because thegoods have been supplied and the price thereof has been de- bited to the purchaser the rights and obligations ofthe vendor and purchaser inter se are not in any manner aﬀected. The vendor is bound to fulﬁl all his obligationsunder the contract and continues to be liable for all the consequences of his default including rejection of hisgoods by the purchaser or a claim for damages 961 for breach of warranty by him. The purchaser is equally entitledto reject the goods or to claim the damages as on breach of warranty by the vendor and all these rights andobligations have got to be worked out in spite of the fact that the entries 'are made in the books of account by thevendor in accordance with the mercantile system of accounting adopted by him. The vendor could not say that heis under no further obligation to the purchaser and that the purchaser must pay the price of the goods debited tohim as a debt arising out of the book entry. The count in any action ﬁled by the vendor against the purchaserwould be a count for the price of goods sold and delivered and would not be a count on an assumpsit for recoveryof a debt due by the debtor to him.It is clear that under these circumstances there is no receipt of the moneys at all, either actual or constructive, incash or in kind, by actual payment or by adjustment or settlement of accounts. There is also no scope for theargument that even though these sums may not be said to be either actually or constructively received theyshould be ""deemed to be received"". The expression ""deemed to be received"" only means deemed by the provisionsof the Act to be received. The phrase statutory receipt might be con- veniently employed to cover income which is'deemed to be received' and instances of such statutory receipts are to be found in the provisions of the Act, e.g.,section 18 (4), section 58 (E), section 58 (J) (3), section 7(2), section 16(1) (c) and sections 19 (2) (vii) and 16(2). (Seethe observations of Beaumont C.J. in Commissionei, of Income- tax, Bombay v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.(1).An amount cannot be ""deemed to be received"" merely by the volition or sweet will of an individual. In all the caseswhich we have mentioned above the proﬁts earned which were credited in the books of account according to themercantile system of accounting were at best ""treated as having been received"" which is neither ""received"" nor""deemed to be received"" and therefore not within the purview of section 4 (1) (a).(1) [ 1938] 6 I.T.R. 603 at p. 614.962 If then proﬁts which have been thus credited cannot be said to be received nor deemed to have been receivedwhen the entries were made in the books of account, the contention urged before us by Mr. Kolah that there couldnot be a second receipt of the amount in British India does not survive. It is true that the words used in section 4(l)(a) relate to the ﬁrst receipt after the accrual of the income.Once it is received by the party entitled to it, in respect of any subsequent dealing with the said amount it cannotbe said to be "" received"" as income on that occasion. [ Per Kania J. in B. M. Kamdar (1)]. The ""receipt"" of incomerefers to the ﬁrst occasion when the recipient gets the money under his own control. Once an amount is receivedas income, any remittance or transmission of the amount to another place does not result in ""receipt"", within themeaning of this clause, at the other place. This was deﬁnitely established by the Privy; Council in PondicherryRailway Co. v. Commissioner of IncomeTax 2) and in Commissionei, of Income-tax v. Mathias (3). If, therefore, theincome, proﬁts or gains have been once received by the assessee even though outside British India they do notbecome chargeable by reason of the moneys having been brought in British India, because what is chargeable isthe ﬁrst receipt of the moneys and not a subsequent dealing by the assessee with the said amount. In that eventthey are brought, by the assessee as his own moneys which he has already received and had control over and theycease to enjoy the character of income, proﬁts or gains.This ratio however does not apply to the facts of the present case before us. The moneys were neither received bythe company nor could be deemed to have been received by it when the entries were made in the books ofaccount at Petlad. They had merely accrued or arisen to it and so far as the receipt thereof is concerned they wereﬁrst received in British India when they were received by Messrs.Jagmohandas Ramanlal (1)[ 1946] 14 I.T.R. 14 at P. 39, (2)[ 1931] 58 I.A. 239.(3) [ 1939] 66 I.A. 23.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html6/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD.

While agreeing generally with that submission in case of residents, we doubt whether that position wouldbe available to a non-resident, who maintains his books of account outside British India according to themercantile system.The section would only be relevant where the total proﬁts of the assessee have to be computed, in which event hewould be entitled to claim that they should be computed according to the system of accounts maintained by him.But the section would hardly be relevant where stray items of income are caught in taxable territories as receivedin taxable territories by a nonresident. The entries in the present case were put in merely to prove that the saleproceeds were received outside British India where the entries were made.That contention however could not be sustained, as section 4 (1) (a) is concerned with cases of actual receipt andnot with cases of paper receipts.Having regard to the observations made above we have come to the conclusion that the High Court "",as right inholding that the two sums of Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878 were the sale proceeds of the goods sold anddelivered by the appellant to merchants in British India, that they were received by Messrs, 964 JagmohandasRamanlal & Co. and by the banks and shroﬀs through whom the railway receipts were negotiated, on behalf of theappellant in. British India, that they were liable to tax under section 4 (1) (a) of the ,*Act as having been received inBritish India on its behalf, that there is nothing either in the facts and circumstances of the case or in law why theyshould be exempted from such liability, that the answers given to the questions which were ultimately consideredby the High Court were correct, and the appellant was rightly held liable for the tax on these two amounts subjectto all just deductions and allowances. - The appeal therefore fails and must stand dismissed with costs.BOSE, J.-I respectfully disagree.Section 3 of the Indian Income-tax Act provides that the "" total income "" is to be charged in accordance with theprovisions of the Act. We have therefore to see what "" total income "" means."" Total income "" is deﬁned in section 2(15). It means (not "" includes "" but means) the total amount of income,proﬁts and gains ""referred to in sub-section (1) of section 4 computed in the manner, laid down in this Act.""Therefore, the computation of all income refeﬀed to in section 4(l.) has to be ""in the manner laid down in the Act "".Section 4 (apart from the provisos and explanations is divided into three clauses, (a), (b) and (c). Clause (b) dealswith residents and (c) with nonresidents. As (a) is general, it is legitimate to infer that it refers to both. Therefore,the words "" received"" and "" deemed to be received "" must be construed in the same sense in both cases except ofcourse where it is otherwise provided in the Act, for sub-section (1) is made subject to the provisions of the Act.Now the words ""deemed to be received"" can be excluded from consideration at once because I agree that they areconﬁned, and are intended to be conﬁned to what I may call the deeming sections in the Act, that is to say, tocases where the deeming must be done 965 under the express provisions of the Act. That leaves us with the word""received"" (I am of course only deal ing with section 4(l) (a) which deals with "" receipts' and not with section 4(l) (c)which refers to ""accruals"" and ""arisals"" and to that which is deemed to ""accrue"" or ""arise"").Now this, in my opinion, is to be contrasted with the words ""accrue"" and ""arise"" which are used in clauses (b) and(c).Though there may be overlapping in some cases, I do not think the three are intended to mean the same thing.The Privy Council thought in Commissioner of Income-tax v.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html7/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY [1953] INSC 6; AIR 1953 SC 187; 1953 SCR 950 (30 Janua…Mathias(1) that there is some variation in meaning between them and in Commissioner of Income-tax v. ChunilalB.Mehta(2) they drew attention to the antithesis between ""accruing and arising in"" and ""received in"", though theyalso said in the earlier case that there is not a complete disjunction between them and that they are not threemutually exclusive qualiﬁcations (page 56); that is, that there may be some overlapping in certain cases.Next, we turn to section 6 which divides the various sources of income under various heads for the purposes ofcomputation and chargeability and states that each head shall be "" chargeable"" ""in the manner hereinafterappearing"". It is to be observed that the word ""shall"" has been used and not "" may "" thereby implying that there isno option in the matter. So far as business is concerned, the head is No. (iv) ""Proﬁts and gains of business etc.""That carries us on to sections 10 and 13 which prescribe the method of computation. Here again, the language isimperative and in the case of a business the method of computation has to be in accordance with the method ofaccounting regularly employed by the assessee: see Commissioner of Income-tax v. Kameshwar Singh(3).Now in the present case, the method of accounting was the mercantile system. The essential diﬀerence (1) [ 1939]7 I.T.R. 48 at 56. (3) [ 1933] 1 I.T.R. 94 at 100 and 101.(2) [ 1938] P I.T.R. 521 at 527, 125 966 between this and the cash basis system is that in the latter actual receipts anddisbursements are taken into account.In the former, sums which are due to the business are entered on the credit side immediately they are legally dueand before they are actually received and expenditures are entered the moment a legal liability to pay arises andbefore the actual disbursements. The proﬁt or loss at the end of the accounting year is therefore based, not on adiﬀerence between what was actually received and what was actually paid out, but on the diﬀerence between theright to receive and the liability to pay. I ﬁnd it impossible in such a case to say that the taxation -is on income, orproﬁts and gains which were ""received"". It can only be oil proﬁts which "" accrued "" or ""arose"" to the assessee in theaccounting year: see the Privy Council in Feroz Shah v.Commissioner of Income-tax('). That, in my opinion, excludes section 4(l) (a) and that in turn means that in such acase a resident is taxed under section 4(l) (b) and a non-resident under section 4(l) (c).Now, this to my mind is of vital importance. The primary object of the Income-tax Act is to tax and not merely toascertain an income. The computation of the income is subsidiary and is only for the purposes of ascertaining thequantum of the tax: see Commissioner of Income-tax v.Kameshwar Singh(2). Therefore, if the legislature chooses to lay down diﬀerent methods of computation and saythat the taxation shall be on the amount so computed, it is essential that these methods be adhered to. In somecases this may be to the advantage of the assessee and in others it may operate to his disadvantage. But that isimmaterial.The importance lies in this. All that can be taxed in a given year are the proﬁts and gains which are received orwhich arise or accrue in the "" previous year"", and if the Act directs that the proﬁts are to be computed in a givencase on ""accruals"" or ""arisals"" and not on actual receipts it is essential that that be (1) [ 1933] 1 I.T.R. 219at 224 and225. (2) [ 1933] 1 I.T.R.94 at 100.967 done; and it follows from that that the tax in such a case can only be on the accruals or arisals and not on theactual receipts, for clearly you cannot tax on that which you are forbidden to compute in a case where the tax canonly be levied on what is computable. under the Act.It is important to draw the distinction for this reason.The rate of tax varies from year to year, therefore if the book proﬁts which are directed to be taxed in a given yearare, say, Rs. 10,000 and the actual receipts only Rs. 100, it makes a lot of diﬀerence which ﬁgure is taken; nor doesit even itself out in the long run, for if the rate of taxation increases in the following year and the state of thebusiness is just the reverse, namely that the book proﬁts are only Rs. 100 whereas the actual receipts arising fromthe previous year's transactions are Rs. 10,000, it will make a considerable diﬀerence to the assessee in thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html8/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY [1953] INSC 6; AIR 1953 SC 187; 1953 SCR 950 (30 Janua…aggregate of tax payable over the years, whether he pays oil the basis of book proﬁts or actual receipts in the twoyears.I am not able to draw a distinction between a resident and a non-resident in these matters. I can ﬁnd no ground forholding that in the case of a resident the mercantile system must be adopted for computing the proﬁts if that isthe system of accounting regularly employed but that that need not be done in the case of a non-resident. If theassessee had been a resident company, the taxation would, in my opinion, have been under section 4(l) (b) onproﬁts and gains which had accrued or arisen and not under section 4 (1) (a) on proﬁts which had been received.The same principle must, in my opinion, be applied in the case of a nonresident and therefore section 4 (1) (c) isattracted, provided the proﬁts and gains have actually accrued or arisen in the taxable territories or they can,because of section 42, be deemed to have accrued or arisen there. If section 4 (1) (c) is not attracted, then the taxcannot be levied.Now, applying section 4 (1) (c), the question is where do the proﬁts and gains arise or accrue, in a case 968 like thepresent ? This is not free from diﬃculty and various views have been, and can be, taken. But as these expressionshave not been deﬁned and as they are not words of art, I think they should be construed in their ordinary meaningwhich businessmen would ordinarily and easily understand in a business transaction. When goods are sold it is tomy mind evident that the proﬁt or the loss on any particular transaction arises out of the sale, for until there is asale there can be no proﬁt. - The proﬁt may not be wholly attributable to the sale but that is another matter. It is tomy mind unquestionable that they arise, in part, at any rate, out of the sale. Therefore, if the goods are sold in thetaxable territories, then, to my mind, the proﬁts, or a portion of them, arise there. As the Privy Council pointed outin Commissioner of Income-tax v.Chunilal B. Mehta(1), in determining where the proﬁts arise the place of the formation of the contract is not thesole criterion, other matters, as for example acts done under the contract are also material.I am not here attempting to go behind the decision of the Supreme Court to the eﬀect that the place of sale is notnecessarily the place of the receipt of the proﬁts. I am construing the word ""arise "" and not ""receive"".That brings me to the next question, where were the goods in the present ease sold ? That is a, mixed question offact and law and must vary in each case and must, in my opinion, be answered in a commonsense way and notnecessarily in the artiﬁcial manner laid down by the Sale of Goods Act to determine where and when the propertypasses. What are the facts here ? In the case of the Rs. 4 lakhs odd, the control over the corpus of the goods wasretained by the assessee right up to the moment the price was paid; and the price was paid not outside BritishIndia but to his nominees in this country, namely, to the assessee's banks in British India.These banks retained the documents of title and had the right to refuse (1) [ 1938] 61.T.R.521 at533.969 delivery until the money was actually handed over.Therefore, the right to get possession of the goods and to take delivery accrued or arose in British India where themoney was actually paid, and that to my mind must be taken to be the place where the proﬁts accrued and arosefor income-tax purposes, not because the money was received there, for we are not concerned with actualreceipts, but because the right which accrued at the date of the transaction was to receive the money in BritishIndia and hand over the goods there on the receipt of the money. As I have said, the substance of the transactionmust be viewed and that cannot be made to depend upon the method of book- keeping. Even if there are no booksthe proﬁts on such a transaction would accrue in the place where the money is to be paid and the goods are to behanded over. I cannot see how that can alter by reason of the method of accounting employed. Accordingly, Iagree that the method of accounting adopted by the assessee cannot aﬀect the substance of the transactionsbetween the parties or aﬀect their nature. The rights and liabilities of the parties inter se cannot be made todepend on the way in which one of them chooses to keep its books. But that is not the case when we come to thequestion of taxation for income-tax purposes. There the method of accounting is vital. But even there thesubstance of the transaction must be viewed, for the substance cannot alter by a mere method of accounting. It isevident that if the assessee had been resident in British India and these transactions had been omitted from tilebooks, the sums which ought to have been entered would be taxable as items which had escaped assessment evenif there had been no actual receipts in that or in any following year. Therefore, it is not the entry in the books whichattracts the taxation but the proﬁts on the transaction itself, and when the mercantile system is used the proﬁtsarise when the right to receive them accrues and not when the entry is made. If the system is properly employedthe entry is made as soon as the right to receive the price arises and so for all practical 970 purposes that is thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html9/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD. V.

What should be taxed, or rather taken into account for the purposes of taxation, are theﬁgures entered in the accounting year as the sale price of the various transactions which the Rs. 4 lakhs represent.The proﬁts which arise out of these transactions do not, on my view, escape tax because the proﬁts accrue or arisein the taxable territories. But the ﬁgure on which the tax is to be computed is not the 4 lakhs odd which representthe actual receipts but another ﬁgure which unfortunately we have not been given. I am of course assuming thatthe ﬁgures were duly entered in the books at the proper time in accordance with the mercantile system ofaccounting. If they were not, then the Income-tax authorities have power to tax income which, for one reason oranother, has escaped assessment Turning to the Rs. 12 lakhs. We know that the ﬁgure entered in the booksrelating to these transactions was Rs.13,41,744. i am not clear whether that was entered in the accounting year with which we are concerned, though Igathered that that was the case. The actual receipts, which followed later, amounted to only Rs. 12,68,480. In myopinion, if anything is computable for the purposes of tax, it is the former ﬁgure (assuming all the entries are in theaccounting year) and not the latter. But in order to determine whether the proﬁts on these transactions are taxableat all, we must examine the transactions.In these cases the sales were to merchants resident in Ahmedabad. But according to the assessee's aﬃdavit, "" Inrespect of buyers from Ahmedabad, the apllicant Mills have no account of such buyers. The 971 price is debited tothe account of the said Jagmohandas Ramlal and company and credited to the sales account in the books of theapplicant:"" and later, Jagmohandas "" discharges its debts by making payments to the applicants from time to timetowards the balance in their said account in the books of the applicant Mills. The said amounts are paid by the saidﬁrm by paying the same to the credit of the applicant Mills with British Indian banks or shroﬀs."" Now, it is evidentfrom this that Jagmohandas & Company do not merely guarantee payment by the Ahmedabad buyers but actuallymake the payments, or the equivalent of payments, to the assessee company. So little do the 'buyers matter thattheir transactions are not even reﬂected in the accounts. All we have is Jagmohandas. It does not, in my opinion,matter whether the actual buyers remained primarily and legally responsible to the assessee or not. The factremains that in practice Jagmohandas & Company actually met the obligations of the buyers and discharged theirliabilities to the assessee. it is, equally clear that Jagmohandas & Company must have recouped themselves insome way from the buyers. The question is how. If the whole of the transactions occurred outside British India andthe buyers or their agents went to Petlad and received the goods there and paid Jagmohandas & 'Companyoutside British India, then I am clear that the proﬁts and gains did not accrue or arise in British India, simply be-cause the (foods were ultimately brought there. But if Jagmohandas & Company or their agents were paid inBritish India, the proﬁts and gains, in my opinion, arose there in the same way as in the 4 lakhs case. IfJagmohandas & Company were the actual agents of the assessee as were the banks in the other case, and thepayments were made in the taxable territories, then the accrual and arising was direct. If, however, they were notthe agents in the strict sense of the term, then I am of opinion that section 42 would be attracted because at thevery least there would be a ""business connection"", 972 provided of course the payments were made in the taxableterritories.Now, here again., I am looking to what was actually done in order to determine what the rights were, for it isevident that what was done was done in pursuance of some agreement, express or implied, between the partieswhich agreement regulated their rights, and those rights in turn determine the place where the proﬁts accrued orarose, or must, because of section 42, be deemed to have accrued or arisen.In my view, the question referred by the Incometax Appellate Tribunal in its statement of the case does not reﬂectthe true position because it concentrates on the actual receipts. If the cash basis system of accounting wasgermane here, then I would agree that the Rs. 4,40,878 was part of the assessee's income in British India, and soalso in the other case, provided the payments were made in British India. But it is misleading to enquire whatwould have happened in circumstances which are not material in this case because of the mercantile system ofaccounting which was employed.As regards the High Court. The learned Judges refrained the question and answered it without sending the caseback to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal for a further statement of the case. That was not strictly proper. But, inmy opinion, the refrained questions suﬀer from the same defect.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/6.html10/11 9/12/2020KESHAV MILLS L TD. V.

The 2nd appellant who was then oﬃciating as the District Magistrate sent this application tothe Sub-Divisional Magistrate for report and on receiving a report from him that A and B should be asked to ﬁle aformal complaint before him, advised them to do so. A brother of A sent a similar petition to the DistrictMagistrate containing also allegations against the trying Magistrate. The 1st appellant, who was the DistrictMagistrate, forwarded them to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate for report, and on receiving his report passed anorder that he saw no reason to withdraw the ﬁle from the Sub-Divisional Magistrate.The High Court of Allahabad held that as the applications contained allegations which might interfere with thecourse of the trial of the proceedings under s. 145, in transmitting the applications the appellants had actedwithout due circumspection and thought though they had no intention to inﬂuence the Sub-Divisional Magistrateand the appellants were therefore guilty of contempt of court:Held, (i) that in transmitting the applications received by them to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate and calling for areport the appellants were not in any way interfering with the course of justice but were only doing their duty assuperior oﬃcers;(ii) it was not possible to hold that any prejudice had been caused by the two applications being sent by theappellants to the Sub,Divisional Magistrate or that any action was necessary to protect the Sub-DivisionalMagistrate who was hearing the case and the appellants were not guilty of any contempt of court.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/8.html/959589589514 9/12/ 2020RIZWAN-UL-HASAN & ANR V .

The mere fact that he had to take action in view of theallegations against the magistrate in that application would not aﬀect this question. The application contained, asalready stated, expressions showing that Phundi Singh was a history sheeter and that the case under section 145,Criminal Procedure Code, was ﬁctitious and was instituted at the instance of Pratap Singh. He should not havetransmitted the entire application. He could have necessary extracts which related to the allegations against themagistrate sent to the' court concerned in the circumstances when the applicants introduced matter irrelevant fortransfer application. It may also be mentioned here that the application could be treated as a transfer applicationthough no such request was made in that application. The application was neither properly presented nor was itaccompanied by an aﬃdavit nor was it stamped.The applicant wanted some action for the protection of his crop from bad characters."" Having found both theappellants guilty of contempt of court of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Jalaun, the High Court took no actionagainst them because they happened to commit contempt of court rather due to their carelessness Find lack ofvigilance 586 than with any deliberate intention to commit it. It was observed that oﬃcers who have to transmitcommunications to courts of justice should be vigilant and careful to see that nothing is transmitted which canhave any eﬀect, even remotely on, the merits of a case.In our judgment, the proceedings for contempt of court against the two appellants on the facts stated aremisconceived and have to be quashed. Both the appellants were superior oﬃcers of the Sub-Divisional Magistrateat the time when they sent the applications of Kedarnath and Matadin for report. They were under a duty tosupervise his work. It is diﬃcult to see how by transmitting the applications received by them to him, and askinghim for his views they were in any way interfering with the course of justice and were committing contempt of hiscourt. Their action cannot be characterized as having a tendency to interfere with the course of justice. Theapplications were transmitted to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in the usual and normal course of the oﬃcialpractice and we 'cannot subscribe to the view of the High Court that only extracts of these applications shouldhave been sent to him for his views and not the applications as such as they contained material which had atendency to interfere with the course of justice.The second appellant, when he was oﬃciating as District Magistrate, received the application of Kedarnath andMatadin with a letter of recommendation from the Secretary of the Congress Committee. This application was inthe nature of a counter complaint, and the appellant acted properly in sending it to the magistrate who was seisedof the original application. He was under no duty to censor it and to out it into pieces and then forward therelevant parts only to the magistrate. The recommendatory letter was an annexure to the application and it had togo with it.The conduct of the Secretary of the Congress Committee in writing a recommendatory letter about the facts ofthe case to the District 587 Magistrate was undoubtedly a communication for the purpose of inﬂuencing hisdecision and was rightly reprobated by the High Court. Such 9, course is calculated, if tolerated, to divert thecourse of justice and ought more frequently than it is, to be treated as what it really is' namely, a high contempt ofcourt. The Congress Secretary has been rightly held guilty of contempt and punished. He has not come to thisCourt and we are no longer concerned with him.But we are unable to ﬁnd how the conduct of the appellant in sending the application which, as we have alreadystated, was in the nature of counter charge to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate who was seised of the originalcomplaint in any way amounted to contempt of court. There are three diﬀerent sorts of contempts known to lawin such matters.One kind of contempt is scandalizing the court itself.There may likewise be a contempt of the court in abusing parties who are concerned in causes in that court. Theremay also be a contempt of court in prejudicing mankind against persons before the cause is heard. The act of theappellant could not fall in either of these three categories.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/8.html/959589589534 9/12/ 2020RIZWAN-UL-HASAN & ANR V . THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [13] INSC 8; AIR 13 SC 15; 13 SCR 51 (5 February 1…So far as the ﬁrst appellant is concerned, under the provisions of section 528 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, hehad authority to withdraw the case under section 145 of the Code pending in the court of the Sub-DivisionalMagistrate. On the application of 22nd March made by Kedarnath and Matadin containing allegations against theSub-Divisional Magistrate he was entitled to use his powers under that section if the allegations contained thereinwere substantiated. It is usual to send such applications to the court concerned for its remarks and that is preciselywhat he did. and as soon as the remarks were received and he was satisﬁed that the allegations were baseless, hedeclined to withdraw the case. We have not been able to see how such an action on the part of the DistrictMagistrate, done in the normal and usual course of the discharge of his duties as such magistrate, could be held tointerfere with the 76 588 course of administration of justice or to create pre- re- judice of any kind against thecomplainant in the proceedings under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There is nothing in section528 of the Criminal Procedure Code which disables a magistrate from taking -action unless he is set in motion bythe petition of one of the parties and nothing in the Code prevents any person from bringing facts to the notice ofthe District Magistrate which might suggest to that magistrate that it was advisable to see whether the magistrateshould remain in charge of a particular case.In our judgment, therefore, the High Court was in error in thinking that the two appellants acted without duecircumspection and thought and were guilty of contempt of the court of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate. We arefurther of the opinion that it was not possible to hold on those facts that any prejudice &rose in the case by thesetwo applications being sent by the appellants to the Sub- Divisional Magistrate or that any action was necessaryfor the protection of the tribunal which was engaged in hearing the case under section 145, Criminal ProcedureCode. As observed by Rankin C.J. in Anantalal Singha v. Alfred Henry Watson (1), the jurisdiction in contempt is notto be invoked unless there is real prejudice which can be regarded as a, substantial interference with the duecourse of justice and that the purpose of the court's action is a practical purpose and it is reasonably clear on theauthorities that the court will not exercise its juris- diction upon a mere question of propriety.The result is that we allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court against the two appellants andacquit them of the charge under section 3 of the Contempt of Courts Act.Appeal allowed.Agent for the appellant-: S.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.-This is an appeal by special leave fromthe judgment and order dated the 16th April, 1951 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Miscellaneous PetitionNo.17 of 1950. The two appellants are members of the Uttar Pradesh Civil Service.583 In March, 1950, appellant No. 1 (Rizwan-ul-Hasan) was posted as District Magistrate, Jalaun, and appellant No.2, Mohammad Munawar, was posted as a Magistrate in the same district, having oﬃciated as District Magistratefor some time in the early part of March, 1960.On 2nd March, 1,950, one Phundi Singh commenced proceedings under section 145 of the Code of CriminalProcedure in the Court of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Jalaun on the allegation that Kedarnath and Matadinwere about to cut his standing crop by force and 'that there was an imminent danger of a breach of the peace. Themagistrate issued notices to the parties complained against and ordered attachment of the standing crop.On 4th March, 1950, one Shriram, brother of Kedarnath, ﬁled a counter application before the court makingcertain allegations against one Thakur Pratap Singh, said to be the real person behind the proceedingscommenced by Phundi Singh. Kedarnath and Matadin, the respondents in Phundi Singh's application, also ﬁled anapplication similar to that of Shriram before the District Magistrate on the same date. This application wasaccompanied by a recommendatory letter written to the District Magistrate by Lalla Ram Dwivedi, Secretary,District Congress Committee. It was received by the second appellant who was then oﬃciating as DistrictMagistrate and was sent by him to the Sub- Divisional Magistrate, Jalaun, in whose court Phundi Singh'sapplication was pending, for report. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate returned it with the remark that a proper com-plaint should be made in his court in the ordinary way on the allegations made in the application. Thereupon thesecond appellant returned the application to Kedarnath and Matadin and advised them to move the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in as formal and proper manner.On the application of Phundi Singh made before the High Court of Allahabad under section 3 of the 584 Contemptof Courts Act, the second appellant was held guilty of contempt of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate on the followingreasoning Shri Mohammad Munawar opposite party No. 5 forwarded application given by the opposite partiesNos' 2 and 3 together with introductory letter to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate,Jalaun. We do not think that he hadany intention to inﬂuence the Sub-Divisional Magistrate with respect to his action in the case under section 145,Criminal Procedure Code. But intention is not 'of importance so far as the question of commission of contempt isconcerned. He certainly acted without due circumspection and thought. It must have been clear to him that theapplication contained expression which aﬀected the due considerations of the points in dispute in the proceedingunder section 145, Criminal Procedure Code. He says in his aﬃdavit and we can accept it that he sent thisapplication to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate just for taking action for the protection of opposite parties No. 2 andNo. 3 and their crop about which an allegation was made that some action was to be taken by the other party thenight following. He should in the circumstances either pass an order for the police himself which he could havevery well done, or he could have just conveyed a gist of the complaint necessitating protection of life and propertyimmediately.His conduct in transmitting the allegations made by the opposite parties No. 2 and 3 to the Sub DivisionalMagistrate, Jalaun, in whose court the case under section 145, Criminal Procedure Code, was pending, did amountto the commission of contempt of that court."" - As regards the ﬁrst appellant, the facts are that on 22nd March anapplication was received by post in the oﬃce of the District Magistrate signed by Shriram containing allegationsagainst the trying Magistrate.

THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN [1953] INSC 9; AIR 1953 SC 174; 1953 SCR 973 (16 February 1953).pdf,"Section 285 of the Criminal Procedure Code permits a trial commenced with the aid of three assessors to becontinued and completed with the aid of less than three if during the course of the trial any assessor is preventedby suﬃcient cause from attending. It does not, however, authorise the substitution of an assessor for an absentone nor an addition to the number of assessors during the course of the trial.A, B and C were summoned to sit as assessors for a murder trial and as C did not appear, D who was in the list ofassessors and who was present in court though not summoned, was asked to sit as an assessor, and the trialcommenced with three assessors","- ""(1) If in the course ofa trial with the aid of assessors, at any time before the ﬁnding, any assessor is from any suﬃcient cause, preventedfrom attending throughout the trial, or absents himself, and it is not practicable to enforce his attendance, the trialshall proceed with the aid of the other assessor or assessors.(2)If all the assessors are prevented from attending or absent themselves, the proceedings shall be stayed and anew trial shall be held with the aid of fresh assessors."" In cases contemplated by this section a trial commencedwith the aid of three assessors can be (1) A.I.R. 1918 Pat. 420. (2) A.I.R. 1942 All, 140.978 continued and ﬁnished with the aid of less than three assessors. This section, however, does neither authorizethe substitution of an assessor for an absent assessor, nor does it authorise an addition of an assessor to thenumber of assessors during the course of the trial. The eﬀect of the provisions of sections 284 and 285 is that a trialcannot be validly commenced with less than three assessors chosen in the manner prescribed by the Code, butonce validly commenced it can be continued in certain cases to a ﬁnish if some, though not all, of the personsoriginally appointed, attend throughout the trial. If all of them do not attend, then a fresh trial has to be held. Anaddition in the number of the assessors or a change or substitution in their personnel during the course of the trialis not warranted by the Code; on the other hand, it is implicitly prohibited. The procedure prescribed by section285(l) is not of a permissive nature. It has to be followed if the conditions prescribed are fulﬁlled, and like section285(2) it is of a mandatory character. No scope is left in these provisions for the exercise of the discretion of thejudge for supplementing these provisions and for holding a trial in a manner diﬀerent from the one prescribed andfor conducting it with the aid of some assessors originally appointed, and also with the aid of some othersrecruited during the trial. Section 309 provides that when a trial is concluded, the court may sum up the evidencefor the prosecution and defence and shall then require each of the assessors to state his opinion orally and shallrecord such opinions. Sub-clause (2) of this section enacts that the judge shall then give judgment, but in doing soshall not be bound to conform to the opinions of the assessors. Sections 326 and 327 enact the method andmanner of summoning assessors and jurors. Section 537 provides as follows:- ""Subject to the provisionshereinbefore contained, no ﬁnding, sentence or order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall bereversed or altered under Chapter XXVII or on appeal or revision on account- 979 (a)of any error, omission orirregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, proclamation, order, judgment or other proceedingsbefore or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code, or...(c)of the omission to revise any list of jurors or assessors in accordance with section 324, or (d)of any misdirectionin any charge to a jury, unless such error, omission, irregularity or misdirection has in fact occasioned a failure ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/9.html/02095957957959537 9/12/2MAGGA & ANR V. THE ST ATE OF RAJASTHAN [13] INSC 9; AIR 13 SC 14; 13 SCR 93 (16 Fe bruary 13)justice."" The ﬁrst objection that was taken in the High Court to the validity of the trial was that Asharam who hadnot been summoned as an assessor could not be appointed as such and hence it should be held that the trialcommenced with a minimum of two assessors in deﬁance of the provisions of section 284. What happened wasthis: On the date ﬁxed for the trial there was a deﬁciency in the number of persons who had been summoned andwho appeared to act as assessors, the court then sent for Asharam whose name was in the list of assessors andordered him to sit as an assessor. The High Court took the view, and we think rightly, that the circumstance thatthe formality of issuing a summons was not gone through was a mere irregularity which was curable under section537 of the Code, as there was no failure of justice caused on account of that irregularity and that the trial on thataccount could not be held to be bad. This view is in accord with the decision of the Calcutta High Court in King-Emperor v. Ramsidh Rai(1) with which we agree. We are constrained, however, to observe that the High Court didnot fully appreciate the decision of the Patna High Court in Balak Singh v. Emperor(2), when it said that thatdecision held a trial bad where a -person was chosen as an assessor who had not been summoned. In that caseduring the examination of the ﬁrst witness only one qualiﬁed assessor was present in court and capable of actingas such, the judge ordered another person who happened to be present in court but was not in the oﬃcial list ofassessors to act as an (1) 30 Crl. L. J . 725.(2) A.I.R. 1918 Pat. 420.980 assessor, and it was held that as the trial commenced with only one assessor and not with two duly qualiﬁedassessors the trial was abortive and contrary to law. No exception could therefore be taken to the rule stated inthis decision.The second objection against the validity of the trial taken before the High Court was -founded on section 285. Itwas contended that when one of the assessors appointed absented himself the court was bound, under section285, to ascertain before proceeding further with the trial whether the absence of the assessor was due to suﬃcientcause and whether it was practicable to enforce his attendance and that the judge in this case failed to observethis condition which alone entitled him to continue the trial with the remaining assessors and that the defect wasfatal to the validity of the trial. The High Court held that though there was non- compliance with the provisions ofsection 285 in the case, this irregularity was cured by section 537 as it had not in fact caused failure of justice. Weagree with the High Court in this conclusion. It is no doubt true that the section enjoins on the judge a duty to ﬁndwhether there is a suﬃcient cause for the non-attendance of an assessor and whether it is not practicable toenforce his attendance, and ordinarily the proceedings must represent on their face whether this duty has beenperformed, but we think that such an omission on his part does not necessarily vitiate the trial. We are further ofthe opinion that when a judge proceeds with a trial in the absence of one or two of the assessors with the aid of theremaining assessor or assessors, it may be presumed that he has done so because he was satisﬁed that it was notpracticable to enforce the attendance of the absent assessor or assessors and that there was suﬃcient cause forhis or their non-attendance.If, however, there is evidence to a contrary eﬀect, the matter maybe diﬀerent. Failure to record an order indicatingthe reasons for proceeding with the trial with the aid of the remaining assessors can at best be an irregularity or anomission which must be held to 981 be such as to come within the reach of section 537 unless it has in factoccasioned a failure of justice. It could not be seriously argued that such an omission can lead to such a result.Finally the learned counsel contended, also relying on section 285, that the sessions judge had no jurisdiction orpower to substitute an assessor or to reinstate the absent assessor, or to add to the number of assessors. Whenthe point was raised before the High Court, it fully realized that there was no provision in law which permitted suchsubstitution of an absent assessor by another assessor or the subsequent reinstatement of an absent assessor asbad been done in this case. It, however, felt that the irregularity was of the same nature as noncompliance with theprovisions of section 285, and as such was cured by section 537 of the Code. In regard to the addition of an assessorduring the trial it said:- "" We have not been able to ﬁnd any reported case where an assessor had been added in themiddle of the trial as has been done by the learned judge. That is perhaps due to the fact that no judge ever didsuch an obviously silly thing, but considering that the trial, in any case, continued with the aid of two assessorswho were there throughout, there was, in our opinion, substantial compliance with the mode of trial provided inthe Code and the irregularity committed by the addition of Chimniram in June, 1952, is curable under section 537as it did not occasion any failure of justice.The sessions judge was still the court of competent jurisdiction to try the case and all that he did was to addunnecessarily one more assessor to advise him when he had no business to do so. We can ignore his presencealtogether and as the irregularity has not caused failure of justice, the trial will not be vitiated"".www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/9.html/02095957957959547 9/12/2MAGGA & ANR V. THE ST ATE OF RAJASTHAN [13] INSC 9; AIR 13 SC 14; 13 SCR 93 (16 Fe bruary 13)In our judgment, the High Court was in error in this view.The sessions judge during the progress of the trial not only made a change in the personnel of the assessorsoriginally appointed and also added to their number, but he. actually took the opinions 127 982 of all the fourassessors as required by the provisions of section 309 of the Code, and acted in accordance with those opinions inconvicting the two appellants. It is plain that a unanimous verdict of four assessors is bound to weigh much morewith a judge than the opinion of two persons. We have not been able to understand how the High Court couldignore the presence of assessors altogether who had given their opinions and which opinions had been acceptedby the judge.The opinion of an assessor is exercised in the judicial function imposed upon him by law, and the judge is bound totake it into consideration and he cannot dispense with it.The judge considered this trial as if lie had commenced it with the aid of four assessors, and taking into -consideration their opinion, he convicted the appellants.It is diﬃcult to assess the value which the judge gave to the opinions of the assessors at the time of arriving at hisﬁnding and the High Court was in error in thinking that it did no harm and caused no prejudice. We cannotsubscribe to the view of the High Court that the trial should be taken as having been conducted with the aid of thetwo assessors as sanctioned by section 285, Criminal Procedure Code. That is not what actually happened. It isdiﬃcult to convert a trial held partly with the aid of three assessors and partly with the aid of four assessors intoone held with the aid of two assessors only. At no stage was the trial held with the aid of two assessors only. Thethird substituted assessor attended a part of the trial and the added fourth assessor also attended a part of it.None of these two were present throughout. Thus the trial when it concluded was a diﬀerent trial from the onewhich was commenced under the provisions of section 284, Criminal Procedure Code. To a situation like this wethink section 537 cannot be called in aid. Such a trial is not known to the Code and it seems implicitly prohibited bythe provisions of sections 284 and 285. What happened in this case cannot be described as a mere error, omissionor irregularity in the course of the trial. It is much more serious, It 983 amounts to holding a trial in violation of theprovisions of the Code and goes to the root of the matter and the illegality is of a character that it vitiates thewhole proceedings. As observed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Subramania lyer v. -King-Emperor('),disobedience to an express provision as to a mode of trial cannot be regarded as a mere irregularity. In AbdulRahman v. King- Emperor (2), the distinction between cases which fall within the rule of section 537 and thosewhich are outside it was pointed out by Lord Phillimore. There it was said that the distinction betweenSuubramania Iyer's case (1) and that case in which there was an irregularity in complying with the provisions ofsection 360 of the Code was fairly obvious. In Subramania Iyer's case(1) the procedure adopted was one which theCode positively prohibits and it was possible that it might have worked actual injustice, to the accused but that theerror in not reading the statements of witnesses to them was of a diﬀerent character, and such an omission wasnot fatal. In Pulukurti Kotayya v. King- Emperor(3) their Lordships again examined this question.That was a case where there had been a breach of the provisions of section 162, Criminal Procedure Code, and itwas held that in the peculiar circumstances of that case it had not prejudiced the accused and the case thereforefell under section 537 and that the trial was valid notwith- standing the breach of section 162. Sir John Beaumont indelivering the decision of the Board made the following observations which bring out the distinction between thetwo sets of cases:-- There are, no doubt, authorities in India which lend some support to Mr. Pritt's contention, andreference may be made to Tirkha v. Nanak (4), in which the court expressed the view that section 537, CriminalProcedure Code, applied only to errors of procedure arising out of mere inadvertence, and not to cases ofdisregard of, or disobedience to, mandatory provisions of the Code, and to In re Madura Muthu (1) (1901) 28 l.A.257. (3) (1947) 74 I.A. 65.(2) (1927) 54 I.A. 96. (4) (1927) I.L.R. 49 All- 475.984 Vannian(1), in which the view was expressed that any failure to examine the accused under section 342,Criminal Procedure Code, was fatal to the validity of the trial, and could not be cured under section 537. In theirLordships' opinion, this argument is based on too narrow a view of the operation of section 537. When a trial isconducted in a manner diﬀerent from that prescribed by the Code [ as in Subramania lyer's case(2)], the trial is bad,and no question of curing an irregularity arises: but if the trial is conducted sub- stantially in the manner prescribedby the Code, but some irregularity occurs in the course of such conduct, the irregularity can be cured under section537, and none the less so because the irregularity involves, as must nearly always be the case, a breach of one ormore of the very comprehensive provisions of the Code. The distinction drawn in many of the cases in Indiawww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/9.html/02095957957959557 9/12/2MAGGA & ANR V. THE ST ATE OF RAJASTHAN [13] INSC 9; AIR 13 SC 14; 13 SCR 93 (16 Fe bruary 13)between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather than of kind. This view ﬁnds support in the decisionof their Lordships' Board in Abdul Rahman v. King-Emperor('), where failure to comply with section 360, CriminalProcedure Code, was held to be cured by sections 535 and 537. The present case falls under section 537, and theirLordships hold the trial valid notwithstanding the breach of section 162."" In our judgment, the trial conducted inthe present case was conducted in a manner diﬀerent from that prescribed by the Code and is bad and no questionhere arises of curing any irregularity. The Code does not authorize a trial commenced with the aid of three namedassessors to be conducted and completed with the aid of four assessors. The substitution of one assessor byanother and an addition to the number of assessors appointed at the commencement of the trial is not sanctionedby section 285, Criminal Procedure Code, nor is it authorized by section 284. On the other hand, the language ofsection 285(l) read with the provisions of section 285(2) implicitly bans the holding of such a trial.It is not possible to say with any degree (1) (1922) I.L.R. 45 Mad. 82o.(2) (1901) 28 I.A. 257.(3) (1927) 54 I.A. 96.985 of certainty to what extent the opinion of the outgoing and the incoming assessors who did not attend thewhole of the trial inﬂuenced the decision in the case ; but as such a trial is unknown to law, it has to be presumedthat it was illegal.Mr. Mehta for the State Government contended that under section 309(2) the opinion of assessors is not bindingon the sessions judge and their presence or absence does not aﬀect the constitution of the court and that as at thistrial at least two of the assessors originally appointed sat throughout the trial it should be held that the trial wassubstantially a trial conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Code. The learned counsel did not go to thelength of urging that a trial without the aid of any assessors whatever was a good trial under the Code. Such acontention, if raised, would have to be negatived in view of the clear provisions of section 284 and of sub-section(2) of section 285. The appointment of at least three assessors is essential for the validity of a trial of this characterat its commencement, and once validly commenced,in certain events, it can be validly concluded if at least one ofthem remains present throughout, while others drop out; but a trial conducted in the manner in which it was donein this case is wholly outside the contemplation of the Code and it is not possible to hold that it was concludedaccording to the provisions of the Code. The provision in the Code that the opinion of the assessor is not bindingon the sessions judge cannot lend support to the contention that the sessions judge is entitled to ignore their veryexistence.As already pointed out, though he may not be bound to accept their opinions, be is certainly bound to take theminto consideration. The weight to be attached to such opinions may well vary with the number of assessors.Mr. Mehta to support his contention placed reliance on the majority decision of the Madras High Court in King-Emperor v. Tirumal Reddi (1). In that case the trial continued for about seven weeks. During that (1) (1901) I.L.R. 24Mad. 523.986 period one of the assessors was permitted to absent himself during two whole days, and ﬁve half daysrespectively, at ﬁrst, so that he might visit his mother on her death-bed, and subsequently, to perform the dailyobsequies rendered necessary by her decease. He then resumed his seat as an assessor and continued so to actuntil the termination of the trial, all the depositions recorded in his absence having been read by him on his return.At the conclusion of the trial the sessions judge invited the opinion of each assessor, and recorded it. The opinionof each was that all the accused were guilty and the judge concurring in that opinion, convicted. the accused. Onappeal it was contended that the judge had acted contrary to law in allowing the assessor who had been absent toresume his seat as an assessor and in inviting and taking into consideration his opinion in deciding the case. It washeld by the majority of the court that the ﬁnding and the sentence appealed against had been passed by a court ofcompetent jurisdiction within the meaning of section 537 of the Code and that the defect in the trial did not aﬀectits validity and was cured by that section as the irregularity had not in fact occasioned a failure of justice. Mr.Justice Davies took a diﬀerent view. This decision was clearly given on the peculiar facts and circumstances of thatcase and is no authority in support of the view contended for by Mr. Mehta.For the reasons given above we are constrained to hold that the trial of the appellants conducted in the mannerabove stated was bad and the appellants have to be retried in accordance with the procedure prescribed by theCode.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/9.html/02095957957959567 9/12/2MAGGA & ANR V.

J. Umrigar for the appellants.Porus A. Mehta for the respondent.1953. February 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.--This is an appeal under article 134(l)(c) of the Constitution of India, by Magga and Bhagga,who have been convicted under section 302, Indian PenalCode, for the triple murders of Ganesh, Gheesa and Hardas.The case relates to an incident which took place -on the night between the 3rd and 4th April, 1951 Gheesa andGanesh, deceased, Ratna, Govind, another Ganesh who is a witness in the case, and Hardas had gone to "" Imaratia"" a well in village Gadwara on that night to keep watch over the crops there. Gheesa slept in one shed near thewell, while Hardas slept in another shed some distance away, and Ratna slept in a third shed near the entrancegate. Ganesh, deceased, Ganesh (P. W.), and Govind slept on the threshing ﬂoor further away from the well. Sometime after midnight Ratna woke up on hearing the cries of Gheesa. It is alleged that he then saw the two accusedbeating Gheesa, accused Magga having in his hand a farsi and accused Bhagga having a katari and an axe. Hardas,who woke up on hearing the cries, rushed to the aid of Gheesa and thereupon the two accused, Magga andBhagga, fell upon him and attacked him with farsi and axe. Ratna 975 ran away and hid himself near the well. Onan alarm being raised, one Krishna who was working on a nearby well came and witnessed the attack on Hardas.The accused, after ﬁnishing Gheesa and Hardas went to the threshing ﬂoor where Ganesh, deceased, wassleeping. There Magga asked Bhagga to hit Ganesh with the axe and Bhagga immediately hit Ganesh with the axeand he fell down. Thereafter Magga hit Ganesh two or three times with the farsi on the legs and Bhagga cut theneck of Ganesh with the katari. Govind (P.W.) entreated on behalf of Ganesh but he was threatened and was told,that if he did not keep quiet he would also be killed. Without injuring Govind and Ganesh (P.Ws.) the accused thenleft the place.Information of the incident was carried to the village by Ratna and a report of it was made to the police at 11-30a.m. on 4th April, 1951. In the report it was stated that "" Bhagga and Magga are standing at their house withswords and are saying that they would kill more persons. Village people are surrounding them outside the house "".The sub- inspector of police, when he arrived at the village, found the house of the accused surrounded by thevillage people.The door of the house was closed from inside and the accused were standing on the chabutra inside. Magga had afarsi in his hand and Bhagga had an unsheathed sword. The sub- inspector got the door opened, arrested theaccused, and took possession of the farsi and the sword. He also recovered the axe and a katari which werebloodstained. The clothes of the accused were also taken possession of after the arrest and they appeared to havebloodstains on them.The accused pleaded not guilty. They admitted their partnership in cultivation at "" Imaratia "" well with thedeceased but denied that any quarrel took place between them and the other partners about the cutting of thecrop. They also denied that they had gone to the well armed with various weapons and had committed the murderof Gheesa, Hardas and Ganesh.The sessions judge on the evidence led by the prosecution felt satisﬁed that the prosecution case was 976 provedbeyond all reasonable doubt. It was held that the murder was brutal and advantage had been taken of the personswho were sleeping to kill them. In the result the appellants were convicted under section 302, Indian Penal Code,and sentenced to death. The sentence of death passed on them by the sessions judge was conﬁrmed by the HighCourt after examining the evidence afresh. In the High Court a contention was raised that the whole trial wasvitiated inasmuch as it had not been conducted in accordance with procedure prescribed by law. This contentionwas negatived on the ground that the irregularities committed in the course of the trial were such as were cured bythe pro- visions of section 537, Criminal Procedure Code. As the objection raised concerned the validity of the trialthe case was certiﬁed as a ﬁt one for appeal to this Court.The facts which concern the validity of the trial, shortly stated, are these: The trial began on 22nd March, 1952.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/9.html/02095957957959527 9/12/2MAGGA & ANR V. THE ST ATE OF RAJASTHAN [13] INSC 9; AIR 13 SC 14; 13 SCR 93 (16 Fe bruary 13)Three assessors had been summoned for that date. Of these two were present while the third did not come.Thereupon one person who was present in the court premises and whose name was in the list of assessors but whohad not been summoned in the manner prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure was chosen as an assessor.The trial then began with the three assessors so chosen, viz., Jethmal, Balkrishna and Asharam. On the 6th June,1952, Jethmal, one of the assessors absented himself and for some reason, which is not clear from the record, oneChimniram was asked to sit in place of Jethmal as an assessor with the result that on the 6th June, 1952, therewere three assessors, viz., Balkrishna and Asharam, who had been sitting from the beginning -of the trial, andChimniram who was introduced for the ﬁrst time that day. On the 23rd June also Chimniram, Balkrishna andAsharam sat as assessors. On 27th June, however, Jethmal reappeared and was allowed to sit and since that datefour assessors sat throughout, viz., Jethmal, Chimniram, Balkrishna and Asharam. Eventually all these fourassessors gave their opinion on the ﬁrst 977 July, 1952, when the trial came to an end. It was con tended that thetrial was bad as it took place in deﬁance of the provisions of sections 284 and 285 of the Code of CriminalProcedure and that such an illegality could not be cured by the provisions of section 537 of the Code.In order to judge of the validity of this objection it is necessary to set out the provisions of the Code relevant to thismatter. Section 284 provides that, ""When the trial is to be held with the aid of assessors, not less than three and, ifpossible, four shall be chosen from the persons summoned to act as such"" . The section as it originally stoodrequired that "" two or more shall be chosen as the Judge thinks ﬁt "", so that there had to be a minimum of twoassessors. In the year 1923, that provision was amended so as to make a minimum of three assessors an essentialrequisite for a trial to be held with the aid of assessors.A trial commenced with less than three assessors is not authorised by the provisions of this section as it nowstands. Therefore, unless a case comes within the provisions of the next following section 285, a trial held indeﬁance of the provisions of section 284 would not be legal. Section 285, however, has no application to caseswhere a trial is commenced with less than three assessors.[ Vide Balak Singh v. Emperor (1); Sipattar Singh v. King-Emperor (2)]. Section 285 provides, B and D. A absented himself during the course of, the trial and the judgeasked E to sit in place of A and proceeded with the trial for some days with B, D and E. Later on A appeared andthe trial continued till the end with the four assessors A, B, D andHeld, (i) that the mere fact that D who had not been sum- moned was allowed to sit as an assessor when the trialcommenced did not vitiate the trial as it, was a mere irregularity and did not cause any failure of justice;King Emperor v. Ramsidh Rai (39 Cr. L.J. 726) approved.Balak Singh v. Emperor (A.I.R. 1918 Pat. 420) explained.(ii)though sub-section (1) of s. 285 imposes a duty on the judge to ﬁnd out whether there was suﬃcient cause forthe absence of an assessor and to consider whether it is not possible to enforce his attendance, it should bepresumed that he has done so when he proceeds with the trial in his absence and a mere omission to recordreasons for proceeding with the trial without the absent assessor would not by itself vitiate the trial ;(iii) a sessions judge, however, has no jurisdiction to substitute another person for any assessor who absentshimself during the trial or to reinstate the absent assessor when be reappears and continue the trial with fourassessors when the trial commenced with three assessors, and the trial in question was there fore illegal.126 974 King Emperor v.

THE STATE OF BIHAR & ORS [1953] INSC 10; AIR 1953 SC 215; 1953 SCR 1129 (20 February 1953).pdf,"The Court of Wards granted to the appellants a large area of land belonging to the Bettiah Raj which was thenunder the management of the Court of Wards, on the recommendation of the Board of Revenue, at half the usualrates. A few years later, the Working Committee of the Indian National Congress expressed the opinion that thesettlement of the lands was against public interest, and in 1950, the Bihar Legislature passed an Act called theSathi Lands (Restoration) Act, 1950, which declared that, notwithstanding anything contained in any law for thetime being in force the settlement granted to the appellants shall be null and void and that no party to thesettlement or his successors in interest shall be deemed to have acquired any right or incurred any liabilitythereunder, and empowered the Collector to eject the appellants if they refused to restore the lands. Theappellants, alleging that the Act was unconstitutional, applied under article 226 of the Constitution for a writ ofmandamus against the State of Bihar restraining it from taking any action under the Act.It was found that there were several other settlements of lands belonging to the Bettiah Raj on similar termsagainst which the Government had taken no action:Held, that the dispute between the appellants and the State was really a private dispute and a matter to bedetermined by a judicial tribunal in accordance with the law applicable to the case, and, as the Legislature had, inpassing the impugned enactment singled out the appellants and deprived them of their right to 1130 have thisdispute adjudicated upon by a duly constituted Court, the enactment contravened the provisions of article 14 ofthe Constitution which guarantees to every citizen the equal protection of the laws, and was void.Legislation which singles out a particular individual from his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability which isnot imposed upon the others and against which even the right of complaint is taken away is highly discriminatory.Though the presumption is in favour of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment and it has to be presumedthat a Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, yet when on the face of astatute there is no classiﬁcation at all, and no attempt has been made to select any individual or group withwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 10.html/0209595195129517 9/12/2RAM PRASAD NARAYAN SAHI & ANR V.

J.-I concur in the judgmentwhich my learned brother Mukherjea is about to deliver, but I wish to add a few words in view of the importantconstitutional issue involved.The facts are simple. The appellants obtained a settlement of about 200 bikhas of land in a village known as SathiFarm in Bettiah Estate, in Bihar, 1131 then and ever since in the management of the Court of Wards on behalf ofthe disqualiﬁed proprietress who is the second respondent in this appeal. The lands were settled at the prevailingrate of rent but the salami or premium payable was ﬁxed at half the usual rate as a concession to the appellantswho are said to be distant relations of the proprietress. The appellants paid the salami and entered into possessionof the lands on the 2nd November, 1946, and' have since been paying the rents regularly. On the 13th June, 1950,the Bihar Legislature passed an Act called the Sathi Lands (Restoration) Act, 1950. The genesis of this legislation isthus explained in the counter-aﬃdavit ﬁled on behalf of the State of Bihar, the ﬁrst respondent herein.Report against the settlement of these lands with the petitioners as well as some other lands to Sri PrajapatiMishra and the unlawful manner in which these settlements were brought about, was carried to the WorkingCommittee of the Indian National Congress, which body, after making such enquiry as it thought ﬁt, came to theconclusion that the settlement of these lands with the petitioners was contrary to the provisions of law and publicpolicy and recommended that steps should be to taken by the State of Bihar to have these lands restored to theBettiah Estate. In pursuance thereof a request was made to the petitioners and to the said Prajapati Mishra toreturn the lands to Bettiah Estate.While Sri Prajapati Mishra returned the land settled with him, the petitioners refused to do so.The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Sathi Lands (Restoration) Bill runs thus:""As it has been held that the settlement of Sathi lands in the District of Champaran under the Court of Wards withSri Ram Prasad Narayan Sahi and Shri Ram Rekha Prasad Narayan Sahi is contrary to the provisions of the law andas Sri Ram Prasad Narayan Sahi and Sri Ram Rekha Narayan Sahi have refused to return the lands to the BettiahEstate, Government 1132 have decided to enact a law to restore these lands to the Bettiah Estate."" The impugnedAct consists of three sections. Section 2(1) declares that ""notwithstanding anything contained in any law for thetime being in force""', the settlement obtained by the appellants is ""null and void"", and that ""no party to thesettlement or his successor in interest shall be deemed to have acquired any right or incurred any liabilitythereunder"". Sub-section (2) provides that the appellants and their successors in interest ""shall quit possession ofthe said land from the date of commencement of this Act and if they fail to do so, the Collector of Champaran shalleject them and restore the lands to the possession of the Bettiah Wards Estate"". Subsection (3) provides for therefund of the amount of salami money and the cost of improvement, if any, to the lessees by the estate onrestoration to it of the lands in question.In the ""case"" lodged in this court for the State of Bihar, the legislation is sought to be justiﬁed and its validitymaintained on the following grounds:www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 10.html/0209595195129527 9/12/2RAM PRASAD NARAYAN SAHI & ANR V.

It is submitted that grants of the lands belonging to the Bettiah Estate made by the Court of Wards were ofdoubtful validity; hence they have been dealt with by the impugned Act ... No evidence has been adduced by theappellants, except a bare allegation, which has not been substantiated, that about 2000 acres of land were settledto show that persons in similar circumstances with whom similar settlements were made, were treated diﬀerently.It is submitted that in the context the impugned Act, has a reasonable basis of classiﬁcation."" The decision of themajority of this Court in Chiran v. The Union of India(1) is relied on in suport of these contentions, In that case,however, the (1) [ 1950] INSC 38; [ 1950] S.C.R. 869, 1133 majority felt justiﬁed in upholding the legislation, though itadversely aﬀected the rights and interest of the shareholders of a particular joint stock company, because themismanagement of the company's aﬀairs prejudicially aﬀected the production of an essential commodity andcaused serious unemployment amongst a section of the community.Mr. Justice Das and I took the 'view that legislation directed against a particular named person or corporation wasobviously discriminatory and could not constitutionally be justiﬁed even if such legislation resulted in some beneﬁtto the public. In a system of government by political parties, I was apprehensive of the danger inherent in specialenactments which deprive particular named persons of their liberty or property because the Legislature thinksthem guilty of misconduct, and I said in my dissenting opinion:""Legislation based upon mismanagement or other misconduct as the diﬀerentia and made applicable to aspeciﬁed individual or corporate body is not far removed from the notorious parliamentary procedure formerlyemployed in Britain of punishing individual delinquents by passing bills of attainder, and should not, I think receivejudicial encouragement."" My apprehensions have come true. Recently we had before us a case from Hyderabad(Civil Appeal ,No. 63 of 1952Ameerunnissa Begum v. Mahboob Begum)' where the duly constituted legislativeauthority of that State intervened in a succession dispute between two sets of rival claimants to the estate of adeceased person and "" dismissed "" the claim of the one and adjudged the Property to the other by making aspecial "" law "" to that eﬀect. And now comes this case from Bihar of an essentially similar type. The appellantsassert title to certain lands in Bettiah Estate under a settlement which they claim to have lawfully obtained fromthe Court of Wards, while it is now alleged on behalf of the Estate that the settlement was not for the beneﬁt ofthe Estate and was contrary to law, as the Court of Wards did not then "" apply its (1) Since reported as [ 1952] INSC70; [ 1953] S.C.R 404 147 1134 mind "" to that question. This is purely a dispute between private parties and a matterfor determination by duly constituted courts to which is entrusted, in every free and civilised society, theimportant function of adjudicating on disputed legal rights, after observing the well established proceduralsafeguards which include the right to be heard, the right to produce witnesses and so forth. This is the protectionwhich the law guarantees equally to all persons, and our Constitution prohibits by article 14 every State fromdenying such protection to anyone. The appellants before us have been denied this protection. A politicalOrganization of the party in power decides after making such enquiry as it thought ﬁt, that the settlement inquestion was "" contrary to the provisions of law and public policy "" and the State Legislature, basing itself on suchdecision, purports to declare the settlement "" null and void "" and directs the eviction of the appellants and therestoration of the lands to the Estate. The reasons given for this extraordinary procedure are indeed remarkablefor their disturbing implications. It is said that ""there was agitation amongst the tenants of the locality andopposition on the part of persons living in the locality against the appellants' possession of the lands which led tobreach of the peace and institution of criminal cases "". Whenever, then, a section of the people in a locality, in'assertion of an adverse claim, disturb a person in the quiet enjoyment of his property, the Bihar Governmentwould seem to think that it is not necessary for the police to step in to protect him in his enjoyment until he isevicted in due course of law, but the Legislature could intervene by making a "" law "" to oust the person from hispossession.Legislation such as we have now before us is calculated to drain the vitality from the rule of law which ourConstitution so unmistakably proclaims, and it is to be hoped that the democratic process in this country will notfunction along these lines.MUKHERJEA J.-This appeal, which has come before us on a certiﬁcate granted by the High Court of 1135 Patnaunder article 132 (1) of the Constitution, is directed against a judgment of a Division Bench of that court, dated 3rdJanuary, 1952, by which the learned Judges dismissed a petition of the appellants under article 226 of theConstitution. The prayer in the petition was for a writ in the nature of mandamus, directing the opposite party, notto take any action, under an Act passed by the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 1950 and known as The Sathi Lands(Restoration) Act which was challenged as void and unconstitutional.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 10.html/0209595195129537 9/12/2RAM PRASAD NARAYAN SAHI & ANR V. THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ORS [13] INSC 10; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 S CR 19 ( 20 F…To appreciate the points in controversy between the parties to the proceeding, it may be necessary to narrate thematerial facts brieﬂy. Maharani Janki Koer, the respondent No. 2 in the appeal, is the present proprietress of anextensive Estate in Bihar known by the name of Bettiah Raj, which is held and managed on her behalf by the Courtof Wards, Bihar, constituted under Bengal Act IX of 1879. On 19th July, 1946, the appellants, who are two brothersand are distantly related to the Maharani, made a representation to the Government of Bihar through theManager of the Estate, praying for settlement in raiyati right, of 200 bighas of land preferably in Sathi farm orMateria farm along with a certain quantity of waste lands. On 20th July, 1946, the then Manager of the WardsEstate wrote a letter to the Collector of Champaran recommending that the applicants might be given settlementof the lands as prayed for, without payment of any selami. The Collector, however, did not. agree to this proposal,nor did the Commissioner of the Tirhut Division, and the matter then came up for consideration before the Boardof Revenue which recommended that settlement might be made with the applicants provided they wereagreeable to pay selami at half the usual rates.On 14th October, 1946, the recommendation of the Revenue Board was accepted by the Provincial Governmentand six days later the Court of Wards accepted a cheque for Rs. 5,000 from one of the lessees, towards payment ofthe selami money and rent for the year 1354 F.S. On the 2nd November, 1946, possession 1136 of the lands wasgiven to the appellants and on the 18th of November following, the Manager of the Court of Wards recorded aformal order ﬁxing the selami of the land at Rs.3,988 annas odd and rent at Rs. 797 annas odd per year. On the same day, a Hisab Bandobasti form, which is theusual form employed in the Estate for raiyati settlements, was signed by the Circle Oﬃcer on behalf of the Court ofWards and by one of the lessees for himself as well as the constituted attorney of the other lessees. It is notdisputed that the lessees continued to possess the lands since then on payment of the stipulated rent.On the 3rd June, 1950, the Bihar Legislative Assembly passed an Act known as The Sathi Lands (Restoration) Actwhich received the assent of the Governor on the 13th June, 1950. The object of the Act, as stated in the preamble,is to provide for restoration of certain lands belonging to the Bettiah Wards Estate which were settled contrary tothe provisions of law in favour of certain individuals. Section 2, which is the only material section in the Act, enactsin the ﬁrst sub-section that the settlement of Sathi lands (described in the schedule to the Act) on behalf of theBettiah Court of Wards Estate with the appellants, as per order of the Manager of the Estate dated the 18thNovember, 1946, is declared null and void and no party to the settlement ,or his successor-in-interest shall bedeemed to have acquired any right or incur any liability under the same. The second sub-section embodies adirection to the eﬀect that the said lessees and their successor-in-interest shall quit possession of the lands fromthe date of the commencement of the Act and if they fail to do so, the Collector of Champaran shall eject themand restore the lands to the possession of the Bettiah Estate. The third and the last sub -section provides that theBettiah Wards Estate shall on restoration to it of the lands pay to the lessees the selami money paid by them andalso such amount as might have been spent by them in making improvements on the lands prior to thecommencement of the Act.1137 In substance, therefore, the Act declared the lease granted by the Bettiah Wards Estate to the appellants onthe 18th November, 1946, to be illegal and inoperative and prescribed the mode in which this declaration was tobe given eﬀect to and the lessees evicted from the lands.On the 28th August, 1950, the appellants ﬁled the petition, out of which this appeal arises, under article 226 of theConstitution in the High Court of Patna, challenging the validity of The Sathi Lands Act and praying for a writ uponthe respondents restraining them from taking any steps under the said Act, or from interfering with the possessionof the appellants in respect of the lands comprised in the lease.It was asserted by the petitioners that in passing the impugned legislation the Bihar Legislature actually usurpedthe power of the judiciary and the enactment was not a law at all in the proper sense of the expression. The othermaterial contentions raised were that the legislation was void as it conﬂicted with the fundamental rights of thepetitioners guaranteed under articles 14, 19(1) (f) and 31 of the Constitution.The respondents opposite parties in resisting the petitioners' prayer stated inter alia in their counter- aﬃdavit thatthe settlement of the lands in question with the appellants by the Court of Wards, was not for the beneﬁt of theestate or advantage of the ward and that the transaction was entered into by the Wards Estate without properlyapplying their mind to it. It was stated further that after the settlement was made, there was a good deal ofagitation among the tenants in the locality which led to the institution of certain criminal proceedings. In thesecircumstances, the matter was brought to the notice of the Working Committee of the Indian National Congresswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 10.html/0209595195129547 9/12/2RAM PRASAD NARAYAN SAHI & ANR V. THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ORS [13] INSC 10; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 S CR 19 ( 20 F…and the Working Committee was of opinion that the settlement of these lands was against public interest. Thelessees, therefore, were asked to vacate the lands and on their refusal the legislation in question was passed.The petition was heard by a Division Bench consisting of Ramaswami and Sarjoo Pershad JJ. Ramaswami J.1138 decided all the points raised by the petitioners against them and held that the Act was neither ultra vires theBihar Legislature nor was void under article 13(1) of the Constitution. The learned Judge was further of opinion thatit was not a ﬁt case for interference by the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution. The other learnedJudge expressed considerable doubts as to whether a legislation of this type, which in form and substance was adecree of a court of law, was within the competence of the legislature and warranted by the Constitution. Heagreed, however, with his learned colleague that the case was not such as to justify an interference of the HighCourt in exercise of its discretionary powers under article 226 of the Constitution. The remedy of the petitionersmight lie, according to him, in a regularly constituted suit. The result, therefore, was that the appellants' petitionwas dismissed and it is the propriety of this judgment that has been assailed before us in this appeal.Mr. P. R. Das, who appeared in support of the appeal, put forward at the forefront of his arguments, the contentionraised on behalf of his client in the court below that the impugned legislation was void by reason of its violating thefundamental rights of the appellants under article 14 of the Constitution. The point appeared to us to be ofsubstance and after hearing the learned Attorney-General on this point we were satisﬁed that the contention ofMr. Das was well- founded and entitled to prevail, irrespective of any other ground that might be raised in thisappeal.There have been a number of decisions by this court where the question regarding the nature and scope of theguarantee implied in the equal protection clause of the Constitution came up for consideration and the generalprinciples can be taken to be fairly well settled. What this clause aims at is to strike down hostile discrimination oroppression or inequality. As the guarantee applies to all persons similarly situated, it is certainly open to thelegislature to classify persons and things to achieve particular legislative objects;1139 but such selection or diﬀerentiation must not be arbitrary and should rest upon a rational basis, having regardto the object which the legislature has in view. It cannot be disputed that the legislation in the present case hassingled out two individuals and one solitary transaction entered into between them and another private party,namely, the Bettiah Wards Estate and has declared the transaction to be a nullity on the ground that it is contraryto the provisions of law, although there has been no adjudication on this point by any judicial tribunal. It is notnecessary for our present purpose to embark upon a discussion as to how far the doctrine of 'separation of powershas been recognised in our Constitution and whether the legislature can arrogate to itself the powers of thejudiciary and proceed to decide disputes between private parties by making a declaration of the rights of oneagainst the other. It is also unnecessary to attempt to specify the limits within which any legislation, dealing withprivate-rights, is possible within the purview of our Constitution. On one point our Constitution is clear andexplicit, namely, that no law is valid which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part IIIof the Constitution. There can be no question, therefore, that if the legislation in the present case comes withinthe mischief of article 14 of the Constitution, it has got to be declared invalid. This leads us to the question as towhether the impugned enactment is, in fact, discriminatory and if So, whether the discrimination made by it canbe justiﬁed on any principle of reasonable classiﬁcation ? The appellants, it is not disputed, are only two amongstnumerous leaseholders who hold lands in raiyati right under the Bettiah Wards Estate. It cannot also be disputedthat the lands were settled with them on the recommendation of the Board of Revenue after due consideration ofthe respective views put forward by the Manager of the Estate on the one hand and the Collector and theDivisional Commissioner on the other. The appellants are admittedly paying rents which are normally assessed onlands of similar 1140 description in the locality. The learned AttorneyGeneral referred in this connection to theprovisions of section 18 of the Court of Wards Act and argued that the lease in dispute was granted incontravention of that section.Section 18 of the Court of Wards Act provides as follows:""The Court may sanction the giving of leases or farms of any property under its charge ... and may direct the doingof all such other acts as it may judge to be most for the beneﬁt of the property and the advantage of the Ward"".Apparently it makes the Court of Wards the sole judge of the beneﬁt to the estate or advantage of the ward. But itis said that the Court of Wards did not apply its mind properly to this matter when it granted lease to theappellants at half the usual rate of selami. The Wards Estate thus suﬀered loss to the extent of nearly Rs. 4,000www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 10.html/0209595195129557 9/12/2RAM PRASAD NARAYAN SAHI & ANR V. THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ORS [13] INSC 10; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 S CR 19 ( 20 F…which could legitimately have been recovered from any other lessee. This contention does not impress us much;the utmost that can be said is that this could have been put forward, for what it is worth and with what result,nobody can say, as a ground for setting aside the lease in a court of law. But that is not the question which isrelevant for our present purpose at all; we were not called upon to decide whether or not the lease was a properone or beneﬁcial to the estate. The question for our decision is, whether the statute contains discriminatoryprovisions so far as the appellants are concerned and if so, whether these discriminations could be reasonablyjustiﬁed ? It is clearly stated in paragraph 9 of the aﬃdavit made by the appellants in support of their petition thatthere are numerous other persons to whom leases on similar terms were granted by the Bettiah Wards Estate.Clauses (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 9 of the aﬃdavit stand thus:""(b) In this long course of management by tile Court of Wards, leases or settlement of lands used to be madewithout any selami on proper rent. This state of aﬀairs continued down to recent times during 1141 which periodthousands of bighas were so settled with numerous persons;(c) in 1945 the authorities decided to make settlements on large scale with war returned soldiers on a selami equalto 5 times the average rent prevailing in the locality for similar lands;(d) in 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1949 a good number of settlements covering about 2000 acres of lands were settled onthe basis of IO years' rental obtaining in the locality and in some cases for good reasons, at ﬁve years' rental."" Inparagraph 12 of the counter-aﬃdavit put in on behalf of the respondents, these statements are not denied. In fact,they are admitted and the only thing said is, that these leases were granted in due course of management.Ramaswami J. has dismissed this part of the case by simply remarking that no details of these settlements werefurnished by the appellants; but no details were at all necessary when the correctness of the statements was notchallenged by the respondents. It will be interesting to note that the respondents themselves in paragraph 10 oftheir counter- aﬃdavit mentioned the name of Shri Prajapati Mishra as one of the persons with whom similarsettlement of lands was made by the Bettiah Estate. It is stated in that paragraph that the cases of the appellantsas well as of Prajapati Mishra were brought to the notice of the Working Committee of the Indian NationalCongress and the Committee came to the conclusion that both the settlements were contrary to the provisions oflaw. Thereupon a request was made to both these sets of lessees to restore their lands to the Estate, but whereasPrajapati Mishra returned his lands to the Bettiah Estate, the appellants refused to do so. In reply to thisstatement, the appellants stated in their rejoinder that the said Prajapati Mishra did not vacate the land,% butcreated a trust in respect of the same, he being the chairman of the board Of trustees and the lands were still inpossession of the board of trustees. Strangely, as it seems, the State of Bihar raked up this matter again in a 1481142 further aﬃdavit where it was admitted that the said Prajapati Mishra did execute a trust and that the trusteestook possession of the property. It was stated, however, that Prajapati Mishra, who was one of the trustees, didactually surrender the lands in two installments but the other trustees did not, and hence legal advice was beingtaken to ﬁnd out ways and means of recovering the property from them. The whole thing smacks ofdisingenuousness and the State of Bihar, it seems, was not well advised in rely- ing upon facts like these in theirattempt to repel the appellants' attack on the legislation on the ground of discrimination.Be that as it may, there is no doubt that the appellants were not the only lessees under the Bettiah Estate who gotsettlement of lands at a selami of ﬁve years' rental. On the sworn statements of the appellants, which are notchallenged by the other side, it appears that there are numerous persons occupying the same position as theappellants, who however were not subjected to this expropriatory legislation. But the vice in this legislation goesmuch deeper than this. It is not merely a question of treating the appellants diﬀerently from the other lesseesunder the Wards Estate, with whom settlements of land have been made on similar or identical terms. If a leasehas been given by a Court of Wards, which is not for the beneﬁt of the estate or advantage of the ward, it is for acourt of ,law to decide whether it is warranted by the terms of the Court of Wards Act. If the lessor proceeds tocancel the lease, the lessee has a legal right to defend his claim and satisfy the court that the lease is not incontravention of law. If, on the other hand, the lessee is actually dispossessed, he has a right to sue in court forrecovery of possession of the property on establishing that he has been illegally turned out. The dispute here, is alegal dispute pure and simple between two private parties. What the Legislature has done is to single out thesetwo individuals and deny them the right which every Indian citizen possesses to have his rights adju- dicated uponby a judicial tribunal in accordance with 1143 the law which applies to his case. The meanest of citizens has a rightof access to a court of law for the redress of his just grievances and it is of this right that the appellants have beendeprived by this Act. It is impossible to conceive of a worse form of discrimination than the one whichdiﬀerentiates a particular individual from all his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability which is not imposedupon anybody else and against which even the right of complaint is taken away. The learned Attorney- General,www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 10.html/0209595195129567 9/12/2RAM PRASAD NARAYAN SAHI & ANR V. THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ORS [13] INSC 10; AIR 13 SC 25; 13 S CR 19 ( 20 F…who placed his case with his usual fairness and ability, could not put forward any convincing or satisfactory reasonupon which this legislation could be justiﬁed. It is true that the presumption is in favour of the constitutionality of alegislative enactment and it has to be presumed that a Legislature understands and correctly appreciates theneeds of its own people. But when on the face of a statute there is no classiﬁcation at all, and no attempt has beenmade to select any individual or group with reference to any diﬀerentiating attribute peculiar to that individual orgroup and not possessed by others, this presumption is of little or no assistance. to the State. We may repeat withproﬁt what was said by Mr. Justice Brewer in Gulf Colorado etc. Co. v. Ellis(1) that ""to carry the presumption to theextent of holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reason for subjecting certain"" individuals orcorporations to hostile and discriminatory legislation is to make the protection clauses of the FourteenthAmendment a mere rope of sand"". In our opinion, the present case comes directly within the principle enunciatedby this court in Ameerunnissa, Begum v. Mahboob Begum(2 ).The result is that we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court.

The relevant portion of section 22 as amended runs as follows:-- ""22. (1) Any dealeraggrieved by an order under this Act may, in the prescribed manner, appeal to the prescribed authority against theorder:Provided that no appeal against an order of assessment, with or without penalty shall be admitted by the saidauthority unless such appeal is accompanied by a satisfactory proof of the payment of the tax, with 991 penalty, ifany, in respect of which the appeal has been preferred."" It is clear from the language used in the proviso to section22 (1) as it stood prior to the amendment that an aggrieved assessee had only to pay such amount of tax as hemight admit to be due from him, whereas under the proviso to section 22(l) as amended the appeal has to beaccompanied by satisfactory proof of payment of the tax in respect of which the appeal had been preferred. Thecontention of the present assessee is that as the amendment has not been made retrospective its right of appealunder the original section 22(l) remains unaﬀected and that accordingly as it does not admit anything to be due itwas not liable to deposit any sum along with its appeal and the Commissioner was bound to admit its appeal andhad no jurisdiction or power to reject it on the ground that it had not been accompanied by any proof of paymentof the tax assessed against the appellant as required under the amended proviso and the Board of Revenue andthe High Court were in error in not directing the Commissioner to admit the appeal.That the amendment has placed a substantial restriction on the assessee's right of appeal cannot be disputed, forthe amended section requires the payment of the entire assessed amount as a condition precedent to theadmission of its appeal. The question is whether the imposition of such a restriction by amendment of the sectioncan aﬀect the assessee's right of appeal from a decision in proceedings which commenced prior to suchamendment and which right of appeal was free from such restriction under the section asit stood at the time of thecommencement of the proceedings.The question was answered in the negative by the Judicial Committee in Colonial. Sugar Reﬁning Co., Ltd. v.Irving(1). In that case the Collector of Customs acting under an Act called the Excise Tariﬀ Act, 1902, required theappellants to pay pound 20,100 excise duty on 6,700 tons of sugar. The appellants disputed the claim. So theydeposited (1) [ 1905] UKLawRpAC 29; L.R. [ 1905] A.C. 369.992 the money with the Collector and then brought the action by issuing a writ on the 25th October, 1902. Aspecial case having been stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court, that Court on the 4th September, 1903,gave judgment for the Collector. In the meantime the Judiciary Act, 1903, was passed and received Royal assent onthe 25th August, 1903, that is to say about 10 days before the judgment was delivered. By section 39(2) of that Actthe right of appeal from the Supreme Court to the Privy Council given by the;Order in Council of 1860 was taken away and the only appeal therefrom was directed to lie to the High Court ofAustralia. The appellants having with the leave of the Supreme Court ﬁled an appeal to the Privy Council therespondents ﬁled a petition taking the preliminary point that no appeal lay to the Privy Council and praying thatthe appeal be dismissed. in dismissing that application Lord Macnaghten who delivered the judgment of the PrivyCouncil said:- ""As regards the general principles applicable to the case there was no controversy. On the one hand,it was not disputed that if the matter in question be a matter of procedure only, the petition is well founded. Onthe other hand, if it be more than a matter of procedure, if it touches a right in existence at the passing of the Act,-it was conceded that, in accordance with a long line of authorities extending from the time of Lord Coke to thepresent day, the appellants would be entitled to succeed.The Judicary Act is not retrospective by express enactment or by necessary intendment.

To deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a superior tribunal which belonged to him as of rightis a very diﬀerent thing from regulating procedure. In princi- ple, their Lordships see no diﬀerence betweenabolishing an appeal altogether and transferring the appeal to a new tribunal. In either case there is aninterference 993 with existing rights contrary to the well-known general principle that statutes are not to be heldto act retrospectively unless a clear intention to that eﬀect is manifested."" The principle of the above decision wasapplied by Jenkins C.J. in Nana bin Aba v. Sheku bin Andu (1) and by the Privy Council itself in Delhi Cloth andGeneral Mills Co. Ltd. v.Income-tax Commissioner, Delhi('). A Full Bench of the Lahore High Court adopted it in Kirpa Singh v. RasaldarAjaipal Singh (3). It was there regarded as settled that the right of appeal was not a mere matter of procedure butwas a vested right which inhered in a party from the com mencement of the action in the Court of ﬁrst instanceand such right could not be taken away except by an express provision or by necessary implication.In Sardar Ali v. Dalimuddin (4), the suit out of which the appeal arose was ﬁled in the Munsiﬀ 's Court at Alipore onthe 7th October, 1920. The suit having been dismissed on the 17th July, 1924, the plaintiﬀs appealed to the Court ofthe District Judge but the appeal was dismissed. The plaintiﬀs then preferred a second appeal to the High Court onthe 4th October, 1926. That second appeal was heard by a Single Judge and was dismissed on the 4th April, 1928.In the meantime Clause 15 of the Letters Patent was amended on the 14th January 1928 so as to provide that nofurther appeal should lie from the decision of a Single Judge sitting in second appeal unless the Judge certiﬁed thatthe case was a ﬁt one for appeal. In this case the learned Judge who dismissed the second appeal on the 4th April,1928, declined to give any certiﬁcate of ﬁtness. The plaintiﬀs on the 30th April, 1928, ﬁled an appeal on thestrength of clause 15 of the Letters Patent as it stood before the amendment. The contention of the appellantswas that the amended clause could not be applied to that appeal, for to do so would be to apply it retrospectivelyand to impair and indeed to defeat a substantive right which was in existence (1) (1908) I.L.R. 32 Bom. 337.

The apppllants claimed that on the 7th October, 1920, when the suit wasﬁled they had vested in them by the existing law a substantive right to a Letters Patent appeal from the decision ofa Single Judge and that an intention to interfere with it, to clog it with a new condition or to impair or imperil itcould not be presumed unless it was clearly manifested by express words or necessary intendment. In giving eﬀectto the contentions of the appellants Rankin C.J. observed at p.518:- Now, the reasoning of the Judicial Committee in The Colonial Sugar Reﬁning Company's case is a conclusiveauthority to show that rights of appeal are not matters of procedure, and that the right to enter the superior courtis for the present purpose deemed to arise to a litigant before any decision has been given by the inferior court. Ifthe latter proposition be accepted, I can see no intermediate point at which to resist the conclusion that the rightarises at the date of the suit."" It was held that the new clause could not be given retrospective eﬀect andaccordingly the date of pre- sentation of the second appeal to the High Court was not the date which determinedthe applicability of the amended clause of the Letters Patent and that the date of the institution of the suit was thedetermining factor.As against the last mentioned decision of the Calcutta High Court Sri Ganapathy Aiyar, appearing for therespondent, refers us to the decision of a Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of Badruddin Abdul Rahim v.Sitaram Vinayak Apte (1), where it was held that the amendment of clause 15 of the Letters Patent operatedretrospectively.That case followed an earlier decision of the same High Court in Fram Bomanji v. Hormasji Barjorji (2). The decisionin the old case proceeded upon two grounds, namely, (1) that the question was one of procedure and (2) that sec-(1) (1928) I.L R. 52 Bom. 753; A.I.R. (1928) Bom. 371.(2) (1866) Bom. H.C. (O.C.J.) 49.995 tion 2 of the New Letters Patent of 1865 gave retrospective operation to the Letters Patent by making itapplicable to all pending suits. In so far as the ﬁrst ground is concerned it clearly runs counter to the decision of thePrivy Council in Colonial Sugar Reﬁning Co. Ltd. v. Irving (supra) and must be taken as overruled as Fawcett J.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/11.html/02095952959547 9/12/2HOOSEIN KASAM DADA (INDIA) LTD. V .

As regards the second ground it is inapplicable to the case before us and it isnot necessary to express any opinion as to the. soundness and validity of that ground. It may be mentioned herethat in Shaikh Hasan Abdul Karim v. King Emperor (1) another Bench of the same High Court expressly dissentedfrom the decision in Badruddin Abdul Rahim v. Sitaram Vinayak Apte (supra).The principle laid down in the Colonial Sugar Reﬁning Co.'s case (supra) was followed by a Special Bench of Madrasin In re Vasudeva Samiar (2). A Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Ram Singha v. Shankar Dayal (3) fell intoline and held that the earlier decision on this point of that Court in Zamin Ali Khan v. Genda (4) stood overruled bythe Privy Council decision in the Colonial Sugar Reﬁning Co.'s case.A Full Bench of Nagpur High Court in Radhakisan v. Shridar (5 ) has also taken the same view. The Punjab HighCourt has also adopted the same line in Gordhan Das v. The Governor General in Council (1).The case of Nagendra Nath Bose v. Mon Mohan Singha Roy (7) is indeed very much to the point. In that case theplaintiﬀs instituted a suit for rent valued at Rs. 1,30615 and obtained a decree. In execution of that decree thedefaulting tenure was sold on the 20th November, 1928, for Rs. 1,600. On the 19th December, 1928, an applicationwas made, under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by the present petitioner, who was one of thejudgment-debtors, (1) I.L.R (1945) Bom. 17.(2) A I.R. (1929) Mad 381 ; 56 M.L.J 369.(3) (1928) I.L.R. 50 All. 965; A.I.R. (1928) All. 437.(4) (1904) I.L.R. 26 All. 375.(5) A.I.R.

That. application having been dismissed for default of his appearance the petitionerpreferred an appeal to the District Judge of Hoogly who refused to admit the appeal on the ground that theamount recoverable in execution of the decree had not been deposited as required by the proviso to section 174,clause (c), of the Bengal Tenancy Act as amended by an amending Act in 1928. The contention of the petitionerwas that the amended provision which came into force on the 21st February, 1929, could not aﬀect the right ofappeal from a decision on an application made on the 19th December, 1928, for setting aside the sale. Mitter J.said at page 1011:- "" We think the contention of the petitioner is wellfounded and must prevail. That a right ofappeal is a substantive right cannot now be seriously disputed. It is not a mere matter of procedure. Prior to theamendment of 1928 there was an appeal against an order refusing to set aside a sale (for that is the eﬀect alsowhere the application to set aside the sale is dismissed for default) under the provisions of Order 43, rule (1), of theCode of Civil Procedure. That right was unhampered by any restriction of the kind now imposed by section 174(5),Proviso. The Court was bound to admit the appeal whether appellant deposited the amount recoverable inexecution of the decree or not.By requiring such deposit as a condition precedent to the admission of the appeal, a new restriction has been puton the right of appeal, the, admission of which is now hedged in with a condition. There can be no doubt that theright of appeal has been aﬀected by the new provision and in the absence of an express enactment thisamendment cannot apply to proceedings pending at the date when the new amendment came into force. It is truethat the appeal was ﬁled after the Act came into force, but that circumstance is immaterial--for the date to belooked into for this purpose is the date of the original proceeding which eventually culminated in the appeal."" 997The, above decisions quite ﬁrmly establish and our decisions in Janardan Reddy v. The State (1) and in Ganpat Raiv. Agarwal Chamber of Commerce Ltd. (2) uphold the principle that a right of appeal is not merely a matter ofprocedure. It is matter of substantive right. This right of appeal from the decision of an .inferior tribunal to asuperior tribunal becomes vested in a party when proceedings are ﬁrst initiated in, and before a decision is givenby, the inferior court. In the language of Jenkins C.J. in Nana bin Aba v. Shaik bin Andu (supra) to disturb anexisting right of appeal is not a mere alteration in procedure. Such a vested right cannot be taken away except byexpress enactment or necessary intendment. An [intention to interfere with or to impair or imperil such a vestedright cannot be presumed unless such intention be clearly manifested by express words or necessary implication.Sri Ganapathy Aiyar urges that the language of section 22(1) as amended clearly makes the section ret. rospective.The new proviso, it is pointed out, peremptorily requires the authority not to admit the appeal unless it bewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/11.html/02095952959557 9/12/2HOOSEIN KASAM DADA (INDIA) LTD. V . THE ST ATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS [13] INSC 11; AIR 13 SC 21; 13 S…accompanied by a satisfactory proof of the payment of the tax in respect of which the appeal is preferred and thisduty the authority must discharge at the time the appeal is actually preferred before him. The argument is thatafter the amendment the authority has no option in the matter and he has no jurisdiction to admit any appealunless the assessed tax be deposited. It follows, therefore, by necessary implication, according to the learnedAdvocate, that the amended provision applies to an appeal from an assessment order made before the date ofamendment as well as to an appeal from an order made after that date. A similar argument was urged before theCalcutta Special Bench in Sardar Ali v.Dalimuddin (supra), namely, that after the amendment the court had no authority to entertain an appeal without acertiﬁcate from the Single Judge.(1) [ 1950] S.C.R. 941.(2) (1952) S.C.J. 564.129 998 Rankin C.J. repelled this argument with the remark at page 520:- "" Unless the contrary can be shown, theprovision which takes away jurisdiction is itself subject to the implied saving of the litigants' right."" In our view theabove observation is apposite and applies to the case before us. The true implication of the above observation asof the decisions in the other cases referred to above is that the pre-existing right of appeal is not destroyed by theamendment if the amendment is not made retrospective by express words or necessary intendment. The fact thatthe pre-existing right of appeal continues to exist must, in its turn, necessarily imply that the old law which createdthat right of appeal must also exist to support the continuation of that right. As the old law continues to exist forthe purpose of supporting the pre- existing right of appeal that old law must govern the exercise and enforcementof that right of appeal and there can then be no question of the amended provision preventing the exercise of thatright. The argument that the authority has no option or jurisdiction to admit the appeal unless it be accompaniedby the deposit of the assessed tax as required by the amended proviso to section 22(1) of the Act overlooks thefact of existence of the old law for the purpose of supporting the pre-existing right and really amounts to beggingthe question. The new proviso is wholly inapplicable in such a situation and the jurisdiction of the authority has tobe exercised under the old law which so continues to exist. The argument of Sri Ganapathy lyer on this point,therefore, cannot be accepted.The learned Advocate urges that the requirment as to the deposit of the amount of the assessed costs does notaﬀect the right of appeal itself which still remains intact, but only introduces a new matter of procedure. Hecontends that this case is quite diﬀerent from the case of Sardar Ali v.Dalmuddin (supra), for in this case it is entirely in the power of the appellant to deposit the tax if he chooses to doso whereas it was not 999 within the power of the appellant in that case to secure a certiﬁcate from the learnedSingle Judge who disposed of the second appeal. In the ﬁrst place the onerous condition may in a given caseprevent the exercise of the right of appeal, for the assessee may not be in a position to ﬁnd the necessary money intime. Further this argument cannot prevail in view of the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Nagendra NathBose v. Mon Mohan Singha (supra). No cogent argument has been adduced before us to show that that decision isnot correct. There can be no doubt that the new requirement ""touches"" the substantive right of appeal vested inthe appellant. Nor can it be overlooked that such a requirement is calculated to interfere with or fetter, if not toimpair or imperil, the substantive right. The right that the amended section gives is certainly less than the rightwhich was available before. A provision which is calculated to deprive the appellant of the unfettered right ofappeal cannot be regarded as a mere alteration in procedure. Indeed the new requirement cannot be said merelyto regulate the exercise of the appellant's pre-existing right but in truth whittles down the right itself and cannotbe regarded as a mere rule of procedure.Finally, Sri Ganapathy lyer faintly urges that until actual assessment there can be no 'lis' and, therefore, no right ofappeal can accrue before that event. There are two answers to this plea. Whenever there is a proposition by oneparty and an opposition to that proposition by another a 'lis' arises. It may be conceded, though not deciding it,that when the assessee ﬁles his return a 'lis' may not immediately arise, for under section 11 (1) the authority mayaccept the return as correct and complete. But if the authority is not satisﬁed as to the correctness of the returnand calls for evidence, surely a controversy arises involving a proposition by the assessee and an opposition by theState. The circumstance that the authority who raises the dispute is himself the judge can make no diﬀerence, forthe authority raises the dispute in the interest of the State and in so acting only represents the State. It 1000 willappear from the dates given above that in this case the 'lis' in the sense explained above arose before the date ofamendment of the section. Further, even if the 'lis' is to be taken as arising only on the date of assessment, therewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/11.html/02095952959567 9/12/2HOOSEIN KASAM DADA (INDIA) LTD. V . THE ST ATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS [13] INSC 11; AIR 13 SC 21; 13 S…was a possibility of such a 'lis' arising as soon as proceedings started with the ﬁling of the return or, at any rate,when the authority called for evidence and started the hearing and the right of appeal must be taken to have beenin existence even at those dates. For the purposes of the accrual of the right of appeal the critical and relevant dateis the date of initiation of the proceedings and not the decision itself.For all the reasons given above we are of the opinion that the appellant's appeal should not have been rejected onthe ground that it was not accompanied by satisfactory proof of the payment of the assessed tax. As the appellantdid not admit that any amount was due by it, it was under the section as it stood previously entitled to ﬁle itsappeal without depositing any sum of money. We, therefore, allow this appeal and direct that the appeal beadmitted by the Commissioner and be decided in accordance with law. The appellant is entitled to the costs of thisappeal and we order accordingly.Appeal allowed.Agent for appellant: Rajinder Narain.Agent for respondent: G. H.

On the 28th November, 1947, the appellantHoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as the assessee) submited to the Sales Tax Oﬃcer,Akola, a Sales Tax return in Form IV for the ﬁrst quarter. Notice in Form XI calling upon the assessee to produceevidence in support of the said return having been issued by the Sales Tax Oﬃcer, the assessee produced hisaccount books. Not being satisﬁed by the inspection of the account books as to the correctness of the return andbeing of opinion that the taxable turnover exceeded rupees two lacs the Sales Tax Oﬃcer submitted the case tothe Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Amravati, for assessment, 989 On the 25th January, 1949, the AssistantCommissioner issued a fresh notice in Form XI under section 11 and ﬁxed the case for disposal on the 5th February,1949. After various adjournments and proceedings to which it is not necessary to refer, the hearing commenced onthe 9th June, 1949, when an agent of the assessee appeared with books of account of the Akola Branch. Eventuallyafter various further proceedings the Assistant Commissioner on the 8th April, 1950, assessed the assessee, to thebest of his judgment, in the sum of Rs.58,657140 and a copy of the order in Form XIV was sent to the assessee. Being aggrieved by the order ofassessment the assessee on the 10th May, 1950, preferred an appeal to the Sales Tax Commissioner, MadhyaPradesh, under section 22(l) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as theAct). The appeal not having been accompanied by any proof of the payment of the tax in respect of which theappeal had been preferred, the authorities, after giving the assessee several adjournments, declined to admit theappeal. The assessee moved the Board of Revenue, Madhya Pradesh, by a revision application against the order ofthe Sales Tax Commissioner contending that his appeal was not governed by the proviso to section 22(l) of the Actas amended on the 25th November, 1949, by the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Act(Act LVII of 1949) but was governed by the proviso to section 22(l) of the Act as it stood when the assessmentproceedings were started, i.e., before the said amendment.The Board of Revenue took the view that as the order of assessment was made after the amendment of thesection and the appeal was ﬁled thereafter such appeal must be governed by the provisions of law as it existed atthe time the appeal was actually ﬁled and that the law as it existed before the ﬁling of the appeal could not applyto the case.The assessee thereupon moved the High Court of Madhya Pradesh under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitutionof India praying, amongst other things, for a writ of mandamus or an appropriate 128 990 order directing the SalesTax Commissioner to admit and hear the appeal without demanding payment of the amount of sales tax assessedby the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax.The High Court dismissed the application on the 2nd August, 1951. The assessee applied to the High Court forleave to appeal to this Court which was also dismissed by the High Court on the 14th March, 1952.

KONDURU VENKATAP A YYA & ORS [13] INSC 12; AIR 13 S C 15; 13 SCR 11 (2…1953. February 26. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This appeal arises out of a suit for recoveryof possession of certain immovable properties measuring about 93 acres and 33 cents which are more fully andparticularly set out and described in Schedule A to the plaint. That suit was instituted by Konduru Venkatapayya,respondent No.1, in his capacity as the Executive Oﬃcer appointed by the Government on the 15th July, 1942, in respect of SriSomasekharaswami Temple at Kotipalle, hamlet of Donepudi, a temple notiﬁed on the 26th October, 1939, underthe provisions of Chapter VIA of the Madras Hindu Religious Endowments Act (Act 11 of 1927). The suit wasinstituted in forma pauperis. The claim for ejectment of the defendants was founded on the allegation that theproperties belonged to the temple, having been given to it by an Inam grant made in 1770 A.D. by Janganna Rao,the then Zamindar of Rachur, that the defendants I to 16 and their predecessors were Archakas rendering NityaNaivedya Deeparadhana services and as such were in possession of the properties for and on behalf of the templeand that defendants 17 to 43 were the lessees under the Archakas and that the defendants I to 16 were wrongfullyclaiming the properties as their own and the other defendants claimed to be in possession of portions of theproperties as their lessees. The plaintiﬀ instituted this suit after having given registered notice to the defendantsto make over possession of the suit properties to the plaintiﬀ as the Executive Oﬃcer of the temple but thedefendants were still continuing in such possession in spite of such notice. The defendants ﬁled writtenstatements raising various contentions 1003 and issues to which it is not necessary now to refer. The learnedSubordinate Judge by his judgment dated the 31st July, 1945, decreed the plaintiﬀ 's suit. Some of the defendantspreferred an appeal to the High Court but the High Court dismissed the same. Those defendants obtained leave ofthe High Court to appeal to the Federal Court and that appeal has now come up for hearing before us.The only two points which were raised before us, as before the High Court, are (1) whether the Inam grant wasmade in favour of the temple or whether the grant was made in favour of the Archakas burdened with the dutiesof service, and (2) what right did the grant confer on the grantee-whether it was a grant of the land itself or only ofthe melvaram interest in the properties.Re l.---It is urged by the learned Attorney-General that as the defendants and their predecessors have been inpossession of the properties from ancient times it should be presumed that their possession originated in somelawful title conferred on them. In short, the contention, founded on several judicial decisions, is that the principleof a lost grant should be applied in this case in favour of the Archakas who have been in quiet possession for over acentury and a half. There is no doubt, on the authorities, that a presumption of an origin in some lawful title may incertain circumstances be made to support possessory rights long and quietly enjoyed where no actual proof of titleis forthcoming but it is equally well established that that presumption cannot be made where there is suﬃcientevidence and convincing proof of the nature of the grant and the persons to whom it was made. It is true that theoriginal grant is not forthcoming but turning to the evidence we ﬁnd two documents which appear to us to bedecisive on the question of title. The ﬁrst one is Exhibit P/3, a copy of the relevant entries in the Inam Register of1860. This Inam Register was prepared after enquiries made by the Inam Deputy Collector and the statementsfurnished at that time by the then Archakas were taken into consideration for 1004 preparing the register. Thecopy of the statement ﬁled by the then Archakas before the Inam Deputy Collector was exhibited in this case asExhibit D/3. In the Inam Register (Ex. P/3) under the several columns grouped under the general heading "" Classextent and value of Inam "" this Inam is classiﬁed in column 2 as Devadayam. In column 3 are set out the surveynumbers together with the word' Dry' indicating the nature of the land comprised within the survey numbers. Theareas are set out in column 5. The heading of column 7 is "" where no survey has been made and no assessmentﬁxed by Government, the cess paid by the ryot to the Inamdar, or the average assessment of similar Governmentland should be entered in column (7) "". Under this heading are set out the amounts of respective assessmentsagainst the three survey numbers totalling Rs.198139. We then pass on the next group of columns under the general heading "" Description, tenure anddocuments in support of the Inam "". Under column 8 'description of Inam 'is entered the remark "" For the supportof a Pagoda. Now kept up "". The entry in column 9 shows that the Inam was free of tax, i.e., sarvadumbala. Undercolumn 10 headed ""Hereditary, unconditional for life only or for two or more lives "" is mentioned ' Permanent '. Thename of the grantor as stated in column 1 1 is Janganna Rao and the year of grant is fasli 1179, A.D. 1770. In column13 the name of the temple is set out as the original grantee. The name of the temple and the location of the templeare also set out under columns 16 and 17. Turning now to the statement Ex.D/3 caused to be written and ﬁled by the then Archakas during the Inam Inquiry held in 1859-60 SreeSomasekharaswami Varu is given as the name of the Inamdar and the present enjoyer. The name of the temple isalso set out under columns 3,5,6 and 12. Under the heading "" Income derived from the Inam whether it iswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 12.html/02095959950069524 9/12/2BUDDU SATYANARAYANA & ORS V.

This statement (Ex. D/3) bears 1005 the signature of the Karnamsand the witnesses. it will be noticed that neither in the Inam Register Ex. P/3 nor in the statement Ex. D/3 is thereany mention of the Archakas as the grantee or for the matter of that, having any the least -interest, personal orotherwise, in the subject-matter of the Inam grant. The two exhibits quite clearly indicate that the Inam grant wasmade in favour of the temple by the gurant or and that in the face of this deﬁnite evidence and proof of the natureof the grant, no presumption of a lost grant can be made in favour of the Archakas. We, therefore, in agreementwith the High Court, hold that the deity was the grantee and the ﬁrst question raised before us must be answeredagainst the appellants.Re 2.-The learned Attorney-General next contends that, assuming that the Inam grant was made in favour of thetemple, it was only a grant of melvaram interest and that the Archakas who have the kudivaram rights cannot beejected. He relies strongly on an unreported judgment of the Madras High Court in Appeal No. 213 of 1942 (TheBoard of Commissioners for the Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Parasaram Veeraraghavacharyulu andothers) where it was held:-- ""The records of the Inam settlement really contain only one clear indication as to theprecise extent of this grant.The statement at the Inam Inquiry, Exhibit V, upon which the decision of the Inam Commissioner was presumablybased contains a column headed "" Income realised from the Inam sarvadumbala "" and in that column we ﬁnd theentry ""Rs. 14 sarvadumbala"". On its face this entry seems to show that the income of the Inam was Rs. 14 free fromall charges. We ﬁnd, however, from the Inam Register, Exhibit IV, that the assessment of the Inam on the basis ofthe enjoyment of 16- 97 acres is also Rs. 14. This seems to indicate that the extent of the Inam was the amount ofthe assessment.* * * * * It seems, therefore, that the decision must rest on the recital in Exhibit V that the income of the Inam1006 consists of Rs. 14, read along with the recital in Exhibit TV that the assessment on the land also comes to Rs.14. On these materials we conﬁrm the ﬁndings of the learned District Judge, although we do not accept hisreasoning, and hold that the grant is a grant of melvaram only."" The facts of that case appear to us to be diﬀerentfrom those in the present case. The Archakas in. that case were found to have the kudivaram rights from beforethe Inam grant was made. In the copies of the Inam Register and Inam Statement ﬁled in that case the Archakaswere shown as the grantees and the present enjoyers of the Inam grant and the amount shown under the headingin column 2 of the Inam register as the assessment was the same as the amount shown under column 3 of the InamStatement under the heading ""Income derived from Inam"". In the case before us the Archakas are nowherementioned in either Exhibit P/3 or in Exhibit D/3, there is no evidence that they had any title to kudivaram rightsand ﬁnally the amount of assessment shown under column 7 of the Inam register, Exhibit P/3, is Rs.198139, whereas the amount shown as income derived from the Inam as shown in column 13 of the InamStatement, Exhibit D/3, is Rs. 26631. Apart from these points of distinction the decision relied on by the learnedAttorney-General appears to us to be of doubtful authority. As will appear from the passages quoted above, thedecision rested mainly, if not entirely, on the fact that the amount of assessment and the amount of income werethe same and the conclusion was drawn that the Inam grant comprised only of the revenue assessment, i.e., ofmelvaram rights. We are unable to follow the reasoning. Whether the Inam comprised the land itself, that is to say,both melvaram and kudivaram rights or only the melvaram rights, the entries had to be made in the Inam Registerin the same form and even in the case of the grant of the land itself comprising both the rights the amount ofassessment had to be set out under column 7 of the Inam Register for it is not 1007 suggested that a diﬀerent formhad to be used where the grant comprised both the rights. It follows, therefore, that no inference that the Inam -grant comprised only melvaram rights can be inferred from the fact that under column 7 only the amount ofassessment is set out, and, therefore, the reasoning on which the decision relied on by the learned Attorney-General was founded cannot be supported as correct. Indeed, that decision has been dissented from by anotherBench of the Madras High Court in Yelamanchili Venkatadri & another v. Vedantam Seshacharyulu and others (1).In the present case the High Court was, in our opinion, clearly right in preferring the last mentioned decision to theunreported decision mentioned above. Having regard to the diﬀerent entries under the diﬀerent columns inExhibit P/3 and Exhibit D/3 there is no escape from the position that this Inam grant in favour of the templecomprised both the interests in the land.An argument was sought to be raised by the learned Attorney- General that the grantor Janganna Rao was onlythe Collector of the revenue and as such could not grant more than what he had got. Reference was made to theKistna District Manual by Gordon Mackenzie but it appeared that the person therein mentioned was not the samewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 12.html/02095959950069534 9/12/2BUDDU SATYANARAYANA & ORS V.

Reference was made to two unreported decisions of the Madras High Court in Appeal No.218 of 1946 (1) A.I.R. 1948 Mad. 72, 1008 Dandibhotla Kutumba Sastrulu v. Kontharapu Venkatalingam, and inAppeal No. 709 of 1944, Buddu Satyanarayana v. Dasari Butchayya, Executive Oﬃcer of the Temple of SriMalleswaraswami Varu, China Pulivaram. In a proceeding for the framing of a scheme relating to a temple it maybe permissible to take into account the claims, moral if not legal, of the Archakas and to make some provision forprotecting their rights, but those considerations appear to us to be entirely out of place in a suit for ejectment onproof of title. If the two decisions lay down, as it is contended they do, that the principles which may have abearing on a proceeding for framing of a scheme or for enforcing the scheme that is framed may be applied to acase of the kind we have now before us it will be diﬃcult for us to uphold them either on authority or on principle.Further what is the conduct of the Archakas defendants appearing on the record of this case ? Although they areArchakas they actually asserted an adverse right in the face of the honest admission of their predecessors in title,made in the Inam statement Exhibit D-3. Such conduct cannot but be regarded as disentitling them from any claimfounded on equity. The explanation put forward for the ﬁrst time in paragraph 7 of their present statement of caseﬁled in this Court explaining the absence of a claim to the property by their predecessors at the time of the InamInquiry namely, respect for the deity enjoined by Agama Shastra is not at all convincing. Further, the giving of suchequitable relief must depend on questions of fact, namely, the income of the property, the reasonable expensesand remuneration for the services, the amounts appropriated by them all this time and so forth which have notbeen investigated into in this case, because, no doubt, this question of equitable relief has been put forward as alast resort after having lost their battle. We do not think in the circumstances of the case any indulgence should beshown to the Archakas even if it were permissible for the Court in a suit of this description to give such relief.1009 The result, therefore, is that this appeal must fail and is accordingly dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.Agent for appellant: S.

The judgment of the court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.--This is an appeal from anorder of a Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Madras issuing a writ of prohibition restraining the 1146Election Commission, a statutory authority constituted by the President and having its oﬃces permanentlylocated at New Delhi, from enquiring into the alleged disqualiﬁcation of the respondent for membership of theMadras Legislative Assembly.The respondent was convicted by the Sessions Judge of East Godavari and sentenced to a term of seven years'rigorous imprisonment in 1942, and he was released on the occasion of the celebration of the ludependence Dayon 15th August, 1947. In June, 1952, there was to be a by-election to a reserved seat in the Kakinada constituencyof the Madras Legislative Assembly, and the respondent, desiring to oﬀer himself as a candidate but ﬁndinghimself disqualiﬁed under section 7 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, as ﬁve years had not elapsedfrom his release, applied to the Commission on 2nd April, 1952, for exemp- tion so as to enable him to contest theelection. No reply to the application having been received till 5th May, 1952, the last day for ﬁling nominations, therespondent ﬁled his nomination on that day, but no exception was taken to it either by the Returning Oﬃcer or anyother candidate at the scrutiny of the nomination papers. The election was held on 14th June, 1952, and therespondent, who secured the largest number of votes, was declared elected on 16th June, 1952. The result of theelection was published in the Fort St. George Gazette (Extraordinary) on 19th June, 1952, and the respondent tookhis seat as a member of the Assembly on 27th June, 1952. Meanwhile, the Commission rejected the respondent'sapplication for exemption and communicated such rejection to the respondent by its letter dated 13th May, 1952,which however was not received by him. On 3rd July, 1952, the Speaker of the Assembly read out to the House acommunication received from the Commission bringing to his notice ""for such action as he may think ﬁt to take"",the fact that the respondent's application for exemption had been rejected. A question as to the respondent'sdisqualiﬁcation having thus been raised, the Speaker referred the question to the Governor of 1147 Madras whoforwarded the case to the Commission for its ""opinion"" as required by article 192 of the Constitution.The respondent having thereupon challenged the competency of the reference and the action taken thereon bythe Governor, the Commission notiﬁed the respondent that his case would be heard on 21st August, 1952.Accordingly, the Chief Election Commissioner (who wag the sole Member of the Commission for the time being)went down to Madras and heard the respondent's counsel and the Advocate-General of Madras on 21th August,1952, when it was agreed that, in case the petitioner's counsel desired to put forward any further representationsor arguments, the same should be sent in writing so as to reach the Commission in Delhi by 28th August, 1952, andthe Commission should take them into consideration before giving its opinion to the Governor.On the same day (21st August, 1952) the respondent applied to the High Court under article 226 of theConstitution contending that article 192 thereof was applicable only where a member became subject to adisqualiﬁcation after he was elected but not where, as here, the disqualiﬁcation arose long before the election, inwhich case the only remedy was to challenge the validity of the election before an Election Tribunal. Heaccordingly prayed for the issue of a writ of mandamus or of prohibition directing the Commission to forbear fromproceeding with the reference made by the Governor of Madras who was not, however, made a party to theproceeding. On receipt of the rule nisi issued by the High Court, the Commission demurred to the jurisdiction ofthe court to issue the writs asked for, on the ground that the Commission was not ""with in the territory in relation.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/14.h/0209595195wwwiiofindirasee95tml27 9/12/2FLECTION COMMISSION, INDIA V. SAKA VENKATA SUBBA RAO UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 14; AIR 13 SC 20; 13 SC…to which the High Court exercised jurisdiction"". A further objection to the maintainability of the application wasalso raised to the eﬀect that the action of the Governor in seeking the opinion of the Commission could not bechallenged in view of the immunity provided under article 361 (1), and that the Commission itself, which had not to""decide"" the question of disqualiﬁcation, but had merely to give its 1148 ""opinion"", could not be proceeded againstunder article 226.On the merits, the Commission contended that article 192 was, on its true construction, applicable to cases ofdisqualiﬁcation arising both before and after the election and that both the reference of the question as to therespondent's disqualiﬁcation to the Governor of Madras and the latter's reference of the same to the Commissionfor its opinion were competent and valid.The application was heard by Subba Rao J. who overruled the preliminary objections and held that article 192 onits true construction applied only to cases of supervening disqualiﬁcations and that the Commission had,therefore, no jurisdiction to deal with the respondent's disqualiﬁcation which arose long before the election tookplace. He accordingly issued a writ prohibiting the Commission from proceeding with the enquiry in regard to thequestion referred to it by the Governor under article 192. The learned Judge, however, granted a certiﬁcate underarticle 132 that the case involved substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, and theCommission has accordingly preferred this appeal.A preliminary objection was raised by Mr. Mohan Kumaramangalam, who argued the case for the respondent withmarked ability, that the appeal brought from the judgment of a single Judge was barred under article 133(3) of theConstitution despite the certiﬁcate granted by the learned Judge overruling the same objection which was alsoraised before him. It has been urged that, so far as civil matters are concerned, the more comprehensive provisionsin article 133(1) (c) for the grant of a certiﬁcate of ﬁtness for appeal to the Supreme Court completely overlaparticle 132(1) which relates only to one speciﬁc ground, namely, a substantial question of law being involved as tothe interpretation of the Constitution, and that the court's power, therefore, to grant a certiﬁcate of ﬁtness on anyground including the ground referred to above, must be deem- ed to arise under article 133(1) (c), with the resultthat the exercise of such power is excluded by the opening 1149 words of clause (3) of that article which bars anappeal from the judgment, decree or ﬁnal order of one Judge of a High Court. The argument was sought to bereinforced by reference to clause (2) of that article and the proviso to article 145(3) both of which contemplateappeals involving substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution being brought without acertiﬁcate having been obtained under article 132. The argument has no force.While it is true that constitutional questions could be raised in appeals ﬁled without a certiﬁcate under article 132,the terms of that article make it clear that an appeal is allowed from ""any judgment, decree or ﬁnal order of a HighCourt"" provided, of course, the requisite certiﬁcate is given, and no restriction is placed on the right of appealhaving reference to the number of Judges by whom such judgment, decree or ﬁnal order was passed. Had it beenintended to exclude the right of appeal in the case of a judgment etc., by one Judge, it would have been easy toinclude a reference to article 132 also in the opening words of article 133(3), as in the immediately precedingclause.If the respondent's contention were accepted, not only would article 132 become redundant so far as it relates tocivil proceedings, but the object of the Explanation to that article, which was designed to supersede the decision ofthe Federal Court in S. Kuppuswami Rao v. The King (1) and thus to secure a speedy determination ofconstitutional issues going to the root of a case, would be defeated, as the Explanation is not made applicable tothe same expression ""ﬁnal order"" used in article 133(1). The whole scheme of the appellate jurisdiction of theSupreme Court clearly indicates that questions relating to the interpretation of the Constitution are placed in aspecial category irrespec- tive of the nature of the proceedings in which they may arise, and a right of appeal of thewidest amplitude is allowed in cases involving such questions. We accordingly overrule the preliminary objectionand hold that the appeal is maintainable.(1) [ 1947] F.C.R. 180.149 1150 Turning now to the question as to the powers of a High Court under article 226, it will be noticed thatarticle 225 continues to the existing High Courts the same jurisdiction and powers as they possessed immediatelybefore the commencement of the Constitution. Though there had been some conﬂict of judicial opinion on thepoint it was authoritatively decided by the Privy Council in the Parlakimedi case(1) that the High Court of Madras--the High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta were in the same position-had no power to issue what were known ashigh prerogative writs beyond the local limits of its original civil jurisdiction, and the power to issue such writs.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/14.h/0209595195wwwiiofindirasee95tml37 9/12/2FLECTION COMMISSION, INDIA V. SAKA VENKATA SUBBA RAO UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 14; AIR 13 SC 20; 13 SC…within those limits was derived by the court as successor of the Supreme Court which had been exercisingjurisdiction over the Presidency Town of Madras and was replaced by the High Court established in pursuance ofthe Charter Act of 1861. The other, High Courts in India had no power to issue such writs at all. In that situation, themakers of the Constitution, having decided to provide for certain basic safeguards for the people in the new set up,which they called fundamental rights, evidently thought it necessary to provide also a quick and inexpensiveremedy for the enforcement of such rights and, ﬁnding that the prerogative writs which the Courts in England haddeveloped and used whenever urgent necessity demanded immediate and decisive interposition, were peculiarlysuited for the purpose, they conferred, in the States' sphere, new and wide powers on the High Courts of issuingdirections, orders, or writs primarily for the enforcement of fundamental rights, the power to issue such directions,etc., ""for any other purpose"" being also included with a view apparently to place all the High Courts in this countryin somewhat the same position as the Court of King's Bench in England. But wide as were the powers thusconferred, a two-fold limitation was placed upon their exercise. In the ﬁrst place, the power is to be exercised""throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction"", that is to say, the writs issued (1) 70 I.A,129 1151 by the court cannot run beyond the territories subject to its jurisdiction. Secondly, the person or authorityto whom the High Court is empowered to issue such writs must be ""within those territories"", which clearly impliesthat they must be amenable to its jurisdiction either by residence or location within those territories.Such limitation is indeed a logical consequence of the origin and development of the power to issue prerogativewrits as a special remedy in England. Such power formed no part of the original or the appellate jurisdiction of theCourt of King's Bench. As pointed out by Prof. Holdsworth (History of English Law, Vol. 1, p. 212 et seq.) thesewrits had their origin in the exercise of the King's prerogative power of superintendence over the due observanceof the law by his oﬃcials and tribunals, and were issued by the Court of King's Bench-habeas corpus, that the Kingmay know whether his subjects were lawfully imprisoned or not;certiorari, that he may know whether any proceedings commenced against them are conformable to the law;mandamus, to ensure that his oﬃcials did such acts as they were bound to do under the law, and prohibition, tooblige the inferior tribunals in his realm to function within the limits of their respective jurisdiction. See also theintroductory remarks in the judgment in the Parlakimedi case(1). These writs were thus speciﬁcally directed to thepersons or authorities against whom redress was sought and were made returnable in the court issuing them and,in case of disobedience, were enforceable by attachment for contempt. These characteristics of the special formof remedy rendered it necessary for its eﬀective use that the persons or authorities to whom the court was askedto issue these writs should be within the limits of its territorial jurisdiction. We are unable to agree with the learnedJudge below that if a tribunal or authority permanently located and normally carrying on its activities elsewhereexercises jurisdiction within those territorial (1) 70 I.A. 129, 140.1152 limits so as to aﬀect the rights of parties therein, such tribunal or authority must be regarded as""function'mg"" within the territorial limits of the High Court and being therefore amenable to its jurisdiction underarticle 226.It was, however, urged by the respondent's counsel that the High Court had jurisdiction to issue a writ to theCommission at New Delhi because the question referred to it for decision related to the respondent's right to sitand vote in the Legislative Assembly at Madras and the parties to the dispute also resided in the State of Madras.The position, it was claimed, was analogous to the court exercising jurisdiction over persons outside the limits ofits jurisdiction, provided the cause of action arose within those limits. Reliance was placed upon the followingobservations of the Privy Council in the Parlakimedi case(1): ""The question of jurisdiction must be regarded as oneof substance and that it would not have been within the competence of the Supreme Court to claim juisdictionover such a matter as the present of issuing certiorari to the Board of Revenue on the strength of its location in thetown. Such a view would give jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in the matter of the settlement of rents of ryotiholdings in Ganges between parties not otherwise subject to its jurisdiction, which it would not have had over theRevenue Oﬃcer who dealt with the matter at ﬁrst instance."" We cannot accede to this argument., The rule thatcause of action attracts jurisdiction in suits is based on statutory enactment and cannot apply to writs issuableunder article 226 which makes no reference to any cause of action or where it arises but insists on the presence ofthe person or authority within the territories"" in relation to which the High Court exercises jurisdiction. Nor is muchassistance to be derived from the observations quoted above.That case arose out of proceedings before a special Revenue Oﬃcer for settlement of fair rent for certain holdingswithin the zemindary estate of Parlakimedi situated beyond the local limits of the original civil jurisdiction of theMadras High Court. Dissatisﬁed (1) 70 I.A. 129..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/14.h/0209595195wwwiiofindirasee95tml47 9/12/2FLECTION COMMISSION, INDIA V. SAKA VENKATA SUBBA RAO UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 14; AIR 13 SC 20; 13 SC…1153 with the settlement made by the Revenue Oﬃcer, the ryots appealed to the Board of Revenue which had itsoﬃces at Madras. The appeal was accepted by a single member of the Board who reduced the rent as desired bythe ryots. The zemindar appealed by way of revision to the Collective Board which sanctioned an enhancement.Thereupon the ryots applied to the High Court for the issue of a writ of certiorari to bring up and quash theproceedings of the Collective Board which passed the order complained of in the town of Madras. The PrivyCouncil considered the question of jurisdiction from two separate standpoints:- ""(a) independently of the local civiljurisdiction which the High Court exercises over the Presidency town; or (b)solely by reason thereof, as an incidentof the location of the Board of Revenue within the town."" On question (a), they examined the powers of theSupreme Court at Madras to issue certiorari beyond the Presidency Town under clause 8 of the Charter of 1800, asit was suggested that the High Court succeeded to the jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court which hadbeen granted the same powers of issuing prerogative writs as the Court of King's Bench in England throughout theProvince, and they recorded their conclusion thus:"" Their Lordships are not of opinion that the Supreme Court would have had any jurisdiction to correct or control acountry court of the company deciding a dispute between Indian inhabitants of Ganjam about the rent payable forland in that district."" Then, dealing with question (b) and referring to their decision in Besants case(1) that the HighCourts of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay had power to issue certiorari in the exercise of their local jurisdiction, theyheld that the principle could not be applied ""to the settlement of rent for land in Ganjam merely on the basis of thelocation of the Board of Revenue as a body which is ordinarily resident or located within (1) 46 I.A. I 76.1154 the town of Madras, or on the basis that the order complained of was made within the town. if SO, it wouldseem to follow that the jurisdiction of the High Court would be avoided by the removal of the Board of Revenuebeyond the outskirts of the town and that it would never attach but for the circumstance that an appeal is broughtto, or proceedings in revision taken by, the Board of Revenue."" Then followed the passage already quoted onwhich the respondent's counsel laid special stress. It will thus be seen that the decision is no authority fordispensing with the necessity of the presence or location, within the local limits of the court's jurisdiction, of theperson or authority to whom the writ is to be issued, as the basis of its power to issue it. Their Lordshipsconsidered, in the peculiar situation they were dealing with, that the mere location of the appellate authorityalone in the town of Madras was not a suﬃcient basis for the exercise of jurisdiction whereas both the subject-matter, viz., the settlement of rent for lands in Ganjam, and the Revenue Oﬃcer authorized to make thesettlement at ﬁrst instance were outside the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court. If the court in Madraswere, recognised as having jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari to the appellate authority in Madras, it wouldpractically be recognising the court's jurisdiction over the Revenue Oﬃcer in Ganjam and the settlement of rentsfor lands there, which their Lordships held it never had. That was the ""substance"" of the matter they were lookingat, and their observations lend no support to the view that if the subject-matter or the cause of action and theparties concerned were within the territorial limits of the jurisdiction, the High Court could issue prerogative writsto persons or authorities who are not within those limits.In any case, the decision did not turn on the construction of a statutory provision similar in scope' purpose orwording to article 226 of the Constitution, and is not of much assistance in the construction of that article.1155 It was said that it could not have been contemplated that an inhabitant of the State of Madras, feelingaggrieved by a threatened interference with the exercise of his rights in that State by an authority located in Delhiand acting without jurisdiction, should seek his remedy under article 226 in the Punjab High Court. It is a suﬃcientanswer to this argument of inconvenience to say that, the language of the article being reasonably plain, it is idleto speculate as to what was or was not contemplated.Our attention has been called to certain decisions of High Courts dealing with the situation where the authorityclaiming to exercise jurisdiction over a matter at ﬁrst instance is located in one State and the appellate authority islocated in another State. It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to decide which High Court would havejurisdiction in such circumstances to issue prerogative writs under article 226.In the view we have expressed above as to the applicability of article 226 to the present case, it is unnecessary toenter upon a discussion of the question whether article 192(1) applies only to members who, having been alreadyelected, have become subject to a disqualiﬁcation by reason of events happening after their election; but havingheard the point fully argued before us, we think it right to express our opinion thereon, especially as both sideshave invited us to do so in view of its general importance.The relevant provisions of the Constitution on which the determination of the question turns are as follows:.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/14.h/0209595195wwwiiofindirasee95tml57 9/12/2FLECTION COMMISSION, INDIA V.

(3) If a member of a House of the Legislature of a State--- (a) becomes subject to any of the disqualiﬁcationsmentioned in clause (1) of article 191 ; or (b) resigns his seat by writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker orthe Chairman, as the case may be, his seat shall thereupon become vacant, 1156 191. (1) A person shall bedisqualiﬁed for being chosen as, and for being, a member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of aState (a) if he holds any oﬃce of proﬁt under the Government of India or the Government of any State, speciﬁed inthe First Schedule, other than an oﬃce declared by the Legislature of the State by law not to disqualify its holder;(b) if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court;(c) if he is an undischarged insolvent;(d) if he is not a citizen of India, or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State, or is under anyacknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State;(e) if he is so disqualiﬁed by or under any law made by Parliament.192. (1) If any question arises as to whether a member of a House of the Legislature of a State has become subjectto any of the disqualiﬁcations mentioned in clause (1) of article 191, the question shall be referred for the decisionof the Governor and his decision shall be ﬁnal.(2) Before giving any decision on any such question, the Governor shall obtain the opinion of the ElectionCommission and shall act according to such opinion.193. If a person sits or votes as a member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council of a State............when he knows that he is not qualiﬁed or that he is disqualiﬁed for membership thereof, or that he is prohibitedfrom so doing by the provisions of any law made by Parliament or the Legislature of the State, he shall be liable inrespect of each day on which he so sits or votes to a penalty of ﬁve hundred rupees to be recovered as a debt dueto the State.As has been stated already, the respondent's conviction and sentence in 1942 disqualiﬁed him both for beingchosen as, and for being, a member of the Legislative Assembly under article, 191 (1) (e) read with section 7 of theRepresentation of the People Act, 1951, 1157 passed by Parliament, the period of ﬁve years since his release on15th August, 1947, not having elapsed before the date of the election. The respondent having thus been under adisqualiﬁcation since before his nomination on 15th March, 1952, could he be said to have ""become"" subject tothat disqualiﬁcation within the meaning of article 192 ? The rival contentions of the parties centred round the trueinterpretation to be placed on that word in the context of the provisions quoted above.The Attorney-General argued that the whole fasciculus of the provisions dealing with ""disqualiﬁcations ofmembers"", viz., articles.190 to 193, should be read together, and as articles 191 and 193 clearly cover bothpreexisting and supervening disqualiﬁcations, articles 190 and 192 should also be similarly understood as relatingto both kinds of disqualiﬁcation. According to him all these provisions together constitute an integral schemewhereby disqualiﬁcations are laid down and machinery for determining questions arising in regard to them is alsoprovided. The use of the word ""become"" in articles 190 (3) and 192 (1) is not inapt, in the context, to include withinits scope preexisting disqualiﬁcations also, as becoming subject to a disqualiﬁcation is predicated of ""a member ofa House of Legislature"", and a person who, being already disqualiﬁed, gets elected, can, not inappropriately, besaid to ""become"" subject to the disqualiﬁcation as a member as soon as he is elected. The argument is moreingenious than sound. Article 191, which lays down the same set of disqualiﬁcations for election as well as forcontinuing as a member, and article 193 which prescribes the penalty for sitting and voting when disqualiﬁed, arenaturally phrased in terms wide enough to cover both preexisting and supervening disqualiﬁcations; but it doesnot necessarily follow that articles 190 (3) and 192 (1) must also be taken to cover both. Their meaning must de endon the language used which, we think, is reasonably plain. In our opinion these two articles go together and 1501158 provide a remedy when a member incurs a disqualiﬁcation after he is elected as a member. Not only do thewords "" becomes subject"" in article 190(3) and ""has become subject"" in article 192(1) indicate a change in theposition of the member after he was elected, but the provision that his seat is to become thereupon vacant, that isto say, the seat which the member was ﬁlling theretofore becomes vacant on his becoming disqualiﬁed, furtherreinforces the view that the article contemplates only a sitting member incurring the disability while so sitting. Thesuggestion that the language used in article 190(3) can equally be applied to a pre-existing disqualiﬁcation as amember can be supposed to vacate his seat the moment he is elected is a strained and farfetched constructionand cannot be accepted.

If this is an anomaly, it arises out of a lacuna in the latter enactment which could easily have provided forsuch a contingency, and it cannot be pressed as an argument against the respondent's construction of theconstitutional provisions. On the other hand, the Attorney-General's contention might, if accepted, lead toconﬂicting decisions by the Governor dealing with a reference under article 192 and by the Election Tribunalinquiring into an election petition under section 100 of the Parliamentary statute referrred to above.For the reasons indicated we agree with the learned Judge below in holding that articles 190(3) and 192(1) 1159 areapplicable only to disqualiﬁcations to which a member becomes subject after he is elected as such, and thatneither the Governor nor the Commission has jurisdiction to enquire into the respondent's disqualiﬁcation whicharose long before his election.As, however, we have held that the High Court was not competent under article 226 to issue any prerogative writto the appellant Commission, the appeal is allowed and the writ of prohibition issued by the learned Judge isquashed.

JAGA DAMBAL & ANR [13] INSC 16; AIR 13 SC 21; 13 S CR 99 (27 February 13)T. R. Srinivasan, for the respondents.1953. February 27. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.-One Thangathammal who was a dasi(dancing girl) lived in the Tanjore district in Madras State and died possessed of some properties. She left hersurviving three daughters, Saraswathi, Jagadambal and Meenambal. Jagadambal ﬁled the suit out of which 941this appeal arises against her sisters for partition of the movable and immovable properties set out in the plaintand for allotment of a third share to her therein. She alleged that her mother was married to one Thyagaraja Pillai,that the properties in suit were the stridhanam properties of her mother who died intestate on 26th July, 1943, andthat according to the law or custom of the community to which the parties belonged she and her sisters wereentitled to share equally the properties of her mother.Saraswathi Ammal, the 1st defendant contested the suit. She pleaded that her mother was not a married womanbut a dasi who followed her hereditary occupation and was attached to Shri Saranatha Perumal temple atTiruchurai in the Tanjore district, that of the three daughters the plaintiﬀ and the 2nd defendant married and livedwith their husbands, while she (1st defendant) was duly initiated as a dasi in the said temple and remainedunmarried and that according to the law and custom of the community, the mother's property devolved solely onher to the exclusion of the plaintiﬀ and the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant supported the 1st defendant's case.The material issue in the suit was issue No. 1 which was in these terms:- "" Who is the proper heir ofThangathammal. Whether according to custom as set tip by the plaintiﬀ, all the daughters are heirs, or accordingto the custom put forward by the 1st defendant, -the unmarried daughters alone are entitled to inherit."" TheSubordinate Judge dismissed the suit holding that Thangathammal was a dasi and not a married woman, thataccording to the custom of the dasi community in South India, a dasi daughter is regarded as a nearer heir to themother than a married daughter and that the 1st defendant was entitled to remain in possession of the suitproperties.Against this decision an appeal was taken to the High Court.The High Court reversed the decree of the Subordinate Judge and held that the custom pleaded by the 1stdefendant 942 was not proved and that the rule of propinquity of Hindu law as a rule of justice, equity and goodconscience, governed the succession and the married and dasi daughters were equally entitled to the inheritance.It was further held that a dasi daughter was not in the status of a maiden or unmarried daughter for purposes ofsuccession to stridhanam property. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted under article 133 of theConstitution.After bearing the learned counsel for the appellant, we feel no hesitation in concurring with the decision of theHigh Court. It was contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the custom set up by the defendantwas not proved. To prove the custom that a dasi daughter was a preferential heir and excluded her married sistersreliance was placed on, the evidence of some members of the community and reference was also made to certaininstancese same kind of evidence was led by the plaintiﬀ support of her case.The evidence of both the parties on the the issue of custom is of an unsatisfactory and inconclusive character andfrom it no inference can be drawn of the existence of a uniform, certain and ancient custom prevailing in thecommunity on this point.Out of the defendant's witnesses, the ﬁrst witness, Rajagopal Pillai, deposed that his wife was the daughter of dasiKamakshi who had six daughters of whom three were married and three were dasis, that on Kamakshi's death, herdasi daughters alone would take the inheritance and that his wife, would be excluded. This statement does nothurt him in any way as his wife will not be bound by what be might state. His bald assertion about the custom inthe community is not of much value. He does not disclose any source of his information. In cross-examination headmitted that he did not know a single speciﬁc instance where such a custom was enforced . The second witnesson the point is the ﬁrst defendant. She stated that one Tulasi's sister Mangalam got no share in her motherAmmani's properties. In cross- examination it was admitted that Mangalam died about fort years ago, 943 i.e.,some time before the defendant was born. She could therefore have no personal knowledge about Ammani'sinstance. No written record of that inheritance is forthcoming. Mangalams son Govindaswami Pillai appeared as D.W. 3. He deposed that Mangalam's mother Ammani had divided her properties between her dasi daughters in herlifetime. The instance therefore is not an instance concerning succession and cannot be treated as relevant in thisenquiry. The 1st defendant further deposed to an instance in Srirangam when succession opened out on the deathof dasi Chellappa. It was said that her property was taken by her dasi daughter Visalakshi to the exclusion of hermarried daughters Marakatham and Rukmini and that the assets were worth a lakh of rupees. One would havewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/16.html/02095950953959525 9/12/2SARASWA THI AMMAL V. JAGA DAMBAL & ANR [13] INSC 16; AIR 13 SC 21; 13 S CR 99 (27 February 13)expected some written documents about that sucession if it took place in the manner deposed to. In the absenceof any evidence from the descendants of Chellappa and in the absence of any documentary evidence regardingthat succession it is diﬃcult to place any reliance on this so-called instance.Defendant No. I stated that her knowledge of it was only from hearsay, and the requirements of section 32 of theEvidence Act not being fulﬁlled, her evidence on this point cannot be treated as admissible. The third witness,about whom reference has already been made, apart from deposing as to Mangalam's instance also deposedabout the instance of dasi Meenakshi. Her daughter Jeevaratnam is married to the witness. He said thatMeenakshi's dasi daughters inherited her property and that his wife was excluded. The only property alleged tobelong to Meenakshi was a house, the value of which is not known. The succession is said to have occurred overtwenty years ago. None of the daughters of Meenakshi have been examined as witnesses in the case, to enablethe court to ﬁnd out the details about it and merely on the statement of this witness the instance cannot be heldproved. The fourth witness for the defendant is her non- contesting sister. She said nothing on the on the questionof custom. She, however, stated 944 that she was not entitled to a share in the assets of her mother. When askedwhy she was making that statement, she said that she was saying so because her husband and some.elders (whose names were. not disclosed) had told her so.Evidence of this character on the question of custom cannot be seriously considered. Venugopal Pillai is theﬁfth,witness for the defendant. He is the husband of the second defendant. His evidence regarding the instance ofChellappa is purely, hearsay. He deposed that he had learnt that a dasi's married daughter is not entitled to claim ashare as she is not her heir in the presence of a dasi daughter and therfore he told his wife not to claim a share.He did not disclose the source of his information. Janaki Ammal, the sixth witness, is a dasi. She deposed that shehas ﬁve daughters of whom two are married, one is a dasi and the other two are young girls and that according totheir caste custom her properties on her death would devolve on her dasi daughters and that the marrieddaughters must remain content with the presents given at their marriage.In cross-examination she admitted that she was deposing about the caste custom not from any speciﬁc instance inwhich the custom was observed but at the request of the defendant, and that she bad heard of this custom fromher elders whose names she did not disclose. She further admitted that she had an uncle living but she did noteven ask him about the custom. The witness, it appears, knows nothing about the custom and is giving evidence inorder to oblige the defendant. The next witness 'Who gave evidence on the issue is D. W. 8, Kamalathammal, adasi. Her mother was also a dasi. She deposed that her mother's properties were divided between her and herother dasi sister and Amba, her third sister, who was married, was not given a share.In cross-examination she admitted that Amba never asked for a share. Neither was Amba produced, nor anywritten munici- pal records showing that the witness actually inherited the property of her mother to the exclusionof Amba. It is diﬃcult to hold this incident proved merely on the 945 vague testimony of this witness. PappathiAmmal, the next witness in the case, is also a dasi. She deposed that her father's mother's property devolved onher two dasi daughters on her death and that there was no married daughter in existence. This- evidence is of aneutral character and is not of much use on the question of custom pleaded in the case. Apart from asserting thatin this community dasi's property devolves on her death only on the dasi daughters to the exclusion of marrieddaughters, she cited the instance of Chellappa, a dasi of Srirangam. It was elicited in cross examination thatChellappa left a house and landed properties. No explanation is forthcoming why documentary evidence ofrevenue records about this instance has been withheld. Oral evidences as to instances which can be proved bydocumentary evidence cannot safely be relied upon to establish custom, when no satisfactory explanation forwithholding the best kind of evidence is given. The last witness in the case is Rajamani Ammal, another dasi whodoes service in Sri Ranganathaswami temple.She also referred to the instance of Chellappa. She said that her jewels which were worth Rs. 1,000 would pass onher death to her dasi daughter. She went to the length of saying that if a dasi leaves an only child who is a marriedwoman, even then her properties will pass to a next heir such as a cousin and not a married daughter. This is all theevidence led by the defendant to prove custom. On this meagre and unsatisfactory material we cannot hold thatthe custom pleaded is proved. The opinion evidence is not of a convincing character and evidence as to speciﬁcinstances in support of the custom is really nil.Our attention was also drawn to a decision of the Madras High Court in Shanmugathammal v. Gomathi Ammal(l)In that case the plaintiﬀ, a member of the dasi community, claimed to succeed to her deceased maternal aunt andwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/16.html/02095950953959535 9/12/2SARASWA THI AMMAL V. JAGA DAMBAL & ANR [13] INSC 16; AIR 13 SC 21; 13 S CR 99 (27 February 13)pleaded that the three surviving sisters of the deceased who were impleded as defendants were not entitled toinherit because one of them (1) 67 M.L.J. 861.122 946 had been adopted by another dancing girl and the other two had become married. The issue raised in thecase was whether the custom set up by the plaintiﬀ that among dancing women married women are excluded by awoman who continues to be' a dasi is true, valid and enforceable.Certain dasis gave evidence in support of the custom. No evidence whatever was given to the contrary and thecustom pleaded was held proved in the circumstances of that case.Emphasis was laid on the circumstance that there was no evi- dence whatsoever against the plaintiﬀ anddefendants 2 and 3 who denied the existence of the custom in their written statements did not venture to deny iton oath in the witness box. The dasi community concerned in that case was a small one consisting originally oftwenty houses of which only seven or eight were then in existence and in that situation it was said that the custommight well be one that was well recognized and so much a part of the consciousness of the community, that anydispute like the present dispute amongst so small a body of women would be an extremely rare occurrence andtherefore impossible of proof and that the plaintiﬀ could not reasonably be expected to search the presidency forwitnesses to speak to some similar dispute in other places. In our opinion, that decision does not furnish a goodjudicial instance in respect of the custom pleaded in the present case. There is no evidence that the customs ofthat small community of dasis are applicable to the community of dasis in the present case which form aconsiderable community in this district. Moreover, the case was decided on the peculiar circumstances of that caseon very meagre materials and did not lay down any general custom of dasis on this point.It is unnecessary to examine the plaintiﬀ 's evidence in detail. Suﬃce it to say that it is more than suﬃcient to rebutthe evidence led by the defendant and it neutralizes its eﬀect, if any. In the absence of proof of existence of acustom governing succession the decision of the case has to rest on the rules of justice, equity and goodconscience because admittedly no 947 clear text of Hindu law applies to such a case. The High Court thought thatthe just rule to apply was one of propinquity to the case, according to which the married and dasi daughters wouldtake the mother's property in equal shares. No exception can be taken to this ﬁnding given by the High Court. Noother rule was suggested to us leading to a contrary result.It was argued that the dasis have a distinct status in Hindu society and, that a rule has been evolved by judicialdecisions under which the state of degradation by itself furnishes a rule of preference in a competition -betweendasi daughters and married daughters. The juidicial decisions referred to concern the community of prostitutesand the rule evolved concerning them has been abrogated by later decisions. It was contended that though thesaid rule had been abrogated and was no, longer applicable to that community concerning which it was evolved, itshould by analogy be applied to cases of succession to dasis.Narasanna v. Oangu(1) was the ﬁrst case cited. There, an adopted niece of a prostitute dancing girl was preferredto a brother remaining in caste. It was said that the legal relation between a prostitute dancing girl and herundegraded relations remaining in caste becomes severed and they are therefore not entitled to inherit the estate.In Subbaratna Mudali v. Balakrishnaswami Naidu(2), the next, case cited, the facts were that a deceased womanPalani inherited the property in dispute from her mother Nagu, who inherited it from her mother Mottai who againinherited it from her father Arunachalam. Arunachalam had two brothers Ramaswami and Mathurbutham and thequestion in that case was whether Mathurbutham's daughter Seethai or Ramaswami's daughter's sonMarudamuthu Mudali was the heir of Palani.The learned judges held that Mathurbutham's daughter was preferential heir to Ramaswami's daughter's son. Itwas pointed out that the rule of preference based on degradation was no longer good law. It was, however, (1)I.L.R. 13 Mad. 133.(2) 33 M.L.J. 207.948 added that in cases of dancing girls the law remained as it was before. Our attention was also drawn to certainobservations in Subbaraya Pillai v. Ramaswami Pillai(1) at page 177, and to the decision in Balasundaram v.Kamakshi Ammal(2). In the former case the learned Judges rejected the broad proposition that Degradation of awoman in consequence of her unchastity entails in the eye of the law cessation of the tie of kindred between herand the members of her natural family and also between her and the members of her husband's family. We thinkwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/16.html/02095950953959545 9/12/2SARASWA THI AMMAL V. JAGA DAMBAL & ANR [13] INSC 16; AIR 13 SC 21; 13 S CR 99 (27 February 13)that decision on this point is sound in law. Degradation of a woman does not and cannot sever the ties of bloodand succession is more often than not determined by ties of blood than by the moral character of the heir.In Balasundaram v. Kamakshi Ammal(2) it was held that the property acquired by the mother had been acquiredby her as a married woman and notwithstanding her lapse into unchastity, it devolved on her daughters clothedwith the ordinary character of property acquired by a Hindu female, that is to say, the daughters took a life estatein it.The learned counsel attempted to persuade us to hold the custom pleaded proved by the assistance of decisionsgiven in analogous cases and by applying the principles of the rules said to have been, enunciated in some of them.Those cases were decided on their own facts and in some of them a rule was enunciated that degraded people area class by themselves and their degraded relations are preferential heirs to the undegraded ones. As already said,we cannot subscribe to the view that any such rule can be evolved merely on logical grounds. Its existence can onlybe justiﬁed on the basis of established custom. No trustworthy evidence has been led in this case to establish thatthe daughters of a dasi by marriage lose their right of inheritance and form a separate community. The correctapproach to a case where a party seeks to prove a custom is the one pointed out by their Lordships of the (1) I.L.R.23 Mad. 171.(2) 71 M.L.J. 785.949 Privy Council in Abdul Hussein Khan v. Soma Dero(1). It was there said that it is incumbent on a party settingup a custom to allege and prove the custom on which he relies and it is not any theory of custom or deductionsfrom other customs which can be made a rule of decision but only any custom applicable to the parties concernedthat can be the rule of decision in a particular case. It is well settled that custom cannot be extended by analogy. Itmust be estabished inductively, not deductively and it cannot be established by a priori methods. Theory andcustom are antitheses, custom cannot be a matter of mere theory but must always be a matter of fact and onecustom cannot be deduced from another. A community living in one particular district may have evolved aparticular custom but from that it does not follow that the community living in another district is necessarilyfollowing the same-custom.The last point taken by the learned counsel was that under Hindu law the 1st defendant as a maiden was entitledto preference over her married sisters. Defendant No. I was admittedly married to the idol and she has been on herown show. living a life of prostitution. The text of the Mitakshara dealing with the case of a virgin can. not beapplied to her case. [ Vide Tara v. Krishna(1)]. It is inconceivable that when the sages laid down the principle ofpreference concerning unmarried daughters they would have intended to include a prostitute within the ambit ofthat text.For the reasons given above we see no force in this appeal and it is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed, Agent for appellant: S.

THE ST ATE OF DELHI & ORS [13] INSC 19; AIR 13 SC 27; 13 SCR 62 ( 12 March 13)Their detention is sought to be justiﬁed on the basis of two remand orders, the one alleged to have been- passedby Mr. Dhillon, Additional District Magistrate, Delhi, at about 8 p. m. on the 6th March, 1953, and the other allegedto have been passed by the trying Magistrate at about 3 p. m.on the 9th March while adjourning the case on the representation made before him that a habeas ""pus petitionwas being moved in this Court.Various questions of law and fact have been argued before us by Mr. Sethi on behalf of the petitioner, but weconsider it unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of those questions, as it is now conceded that the ﬁrst order ofremand dated the 6th March even assuming it was a valid one expired on the 9th March and is no longer in force.As regards the order of remand alleged to have been made by the trying Magistrate on the 9th March, the positionis as follows:-The trying Magistrate was obviously proceeding at that stage under section 344 of the CriminalProcedure Code, which requires him, if he chooses to adjourn the case pending before him, "" to remand by warrantthe accused if in custody,"" and it goes on to provide: Every order made under this section by a court other than aHigh Court shall be in writing signed by the presiding Judge or Magistrate. The order of the Magistrate under thissection was produced before us in compliance with an order of this Court made on the 10th March, which directedthe production in this Court as early as possible of the records before the Additional District Magistrate and thetrying Magistrate together with the remand papers for inspection by Counsel for the petitioner. The orderproduced merely directs the adjournment of the case till the 11th March and contains no direction for, remandingthe accused to custody till that date. Last 85 654 evening, four slips of paper were handed to the Registrar of thisCourt at 5-20 p. m. On one side they purport to be warrants of detention dated 6th March and addressed to theSuperintendent of Jail, Delhi, directing the accused to be kept in judicial lock-up and to be produced in court on the9th March 1953. These warrants contain on their back the following endorsements: Remanded to judicial till 11thMarch, 1953"" In a question of habeas corpus, when the lawfulness or otherwise of the custody of the personsconcerned is in question, it is obvious that these documents, if genuine would be of vital importance, but theywere not produced, notwithstanding the clear direction contained in our order of the 10th March. The courtrecords produced before us do not contain any order of remand made on the 9th March. As we have alreadyobserved, we have the order of the trying Magistrate merely adjourning the case to the 11th. The Solicitor-Generalappearing on behalf of the Government explains that these slips of paper,which would be of crucial importance tothe case, were with a police oﬃcer who was present in court yesterday, but after the Court rose in the evening thelatter thought that their production might be of some importance and therefore they were ﬁled before theRegistrar at 5-20 p. m. We cannot take notice of documents produced in such circumstances, and we are notsatisﬁed that there was any order of remand committing the accused to further custody till the 11th March. It hasbeen held by this Court that in habeas corpus proceedings, the Court is to have regard to the legality or otherwiseof the detention at the time of the return and not with reference to the institution of the proceedings. The materialdate on the facts of this case is the 10th March, when the aﬃdavit on behalf of the Government was ﬁled justifyingthe detention as a lawful one. But the position, as we have stated, is that on that date there was no orderremanding the four persons to custody. This Court has often reiterated before that those who 655 feel called uponto deprive other persons of their personal liberty in the discharge of what they conceive to be their duty, muststrictly and -scrupulously observe the forms and rules of the law. That has not been done in this case.

Finsbury Borough Council(2), Lord Asquith while dealing with the provisions of theTown and County Planning Act, 1947, made reference to the same principle and observed as follows:- "" If you arebidden to treat an imaginary state of aﬀairs as real, you must surely, unless prohibited from doing so, also imagineas real the consequences and incidents which, if the putative state of aﬀairs had in fact existed, must inevitablyhave ﬂowed from or accompanied it........ The statute says that you must imagine a certain state of aﬀairs; it doesnot (1) [ 1881] UKLawRpCh 160; 17 Ch. D.746, at P. 756, (2) [ 1952] A.C. 109.779 say that having done so, you must cause or permit your imagination to boggle when it comes to the inevitablecorollaries of that state of aﬀairs."" The corollary thus of declaring the provisions of section 25 of the BombayGeneral Clauses Act applicable to the repeal of the ordinance and of deeming that ordinance an enactment is thatwherever the word ""ordinance"" occurs in the notiﬁcation, that word has to be read as an enactment.For the reasons given above we are satisﬁed that the High Court was in error in holding that the notiﬁcation onlyextended the provisions of the ordinance to Ratnagiri district and not the provisions of Act XXXI of 1948 to thatarea. It may, however, be observed that the manner adopted by the legislature in keeping alive the notiﬁcationsissued under the ordinance by use of somewhat involved language in matters where the rights of the citizensregarding the construction of buildings were being aﬀected was not very happy. It has certainly led three judges tothink that the intention of the legislature was not brought out by the language. People who are not lawyers maywell be misled into thinking that the notiﬁcation issued under the ordinance has terminated with its repeal and nothaving been re-issued under the Act, the provisions of which again in clear language provide that it only extends towww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 20.html/0209595495739534 9/12/2THE STA TE OF BOMBAY V.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.-The respondents were charged withhaving committed an oﬀence punishable under section 9(2) read with section 4 of the Bombay Building (Controlon Erection) Act, 1948, for commencing the work of erection of a cinema theatre without obtaining the necessarypermission from the controller of buildings, Bombay. The sub-divisional magistrate, Ratnagiri, held that the Actnot having been validly extended to Ratnagiri, no permission of the controller of buildings was necessary for theconstruction.He accordingly acquitted them. On appeal by the State Government, the order of acquittal was maintained by theHigh Court. This appeal is before us by special leave from the concurrent orders of acquittal.Special leave was granted on the Attorney-General for India undertaking on behalf of the State Government ofBombay that whatever the decision of the court might be, no proceedings will be taken against the respondents inrespect of the subject-matter under appeal. At the hearing of the appeal it was made plain by the learnedAttorney-General that no adverse consequences will ﬂow to the respondents or to their building being completed,by the acquittal order being pronounced as bad, and that the State Government will not in any way interfere withthe respondents when they take steps to complete the building, the construction of which was commencedwithout the permission of the controller. The State Government merely wants to have the question of law decidedas a test case because the decision of the High Court, if left unchallenged, would have far-reaching eﬀects.Thefacts giving rise to the prosecution of the respondents, shortly stated, are these: There was in force in the State ofBombay an Ordinance, Bombay 775 Building (Control on Erection) Ordinance, 1948. It was applicable to certainareas speciﬁed in the schedule. The district of Ratnagiri was not one of the areas therein speciﬁed. Sub-section (4)of section (1) of the Ordinance empowered the provincial government by notiﬁcation in the oﬃcial gazette toextend to any other area speciﬁed in such notiﬁcation its provisions. It further empowered the provincialgovernment to direct that it shall apply only in respect of buildings intended to be used for such purpose as may bespeciﬁed in the notiﬁcation. On 15th January.1948, the Government of Bombay issued the following notiﬁcation:- "" In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (4) of section 1 of the Bombay Building (Control on Erection) Ordinance, 1948 (Ordinance No. I of 1948),the Government of Bombay is pleased to direct that the said ordinance shall also extend to all areas in theprovince of Bombay other than the areas speciﬁed in the schedule to the said Act and that it shall apply to saidareas only in respect of buildings intended to be used for the purpose of cinemas, theatres and other places ofamusement or entertainment."" The consequence of this notiﬁcation was that in the district of Ratnagiri no cinemabuilding could be commenced without the permission of the controller after that date.Ordinance I of 1948 was repealed by Act XXXI of 1948, The Bombay Building (Control on Erection)' Act, 1948"". Itwas made applicable to areas speciﬁed in the schedule.Sub-section (3) of section I authorized the provincial government by notiﬁcation in the oﬃcial gazette to directthat it shall also extend to any other. areas speciﬁed therein. It further authorized the provincial government todirect that it shall apply only in respect of buildings intended to be used for such purposes as may be speciﬁed inthe notiﬁcation. By section 15(1) of the Act it was pro- vided that- `` The Bombay Building (Control on Erection)Ordinance, 1948, is hereby repealed and it is hereby 776 declared that the provisions of sections 7 and 25 of theBombay General Clauses Act, 1904, shall apply to the repeal as if that Ordinance were an enactment."" Therespondents started constructing a cinema at Ratnagiri on 15th August, 1948, after the commencement of ActXXXI of 1948 without obtaining the permission of the controller of buildings as required by the Act under theimpression that the Act had application only to areas speciﬁed in the schedule and the district of Ratnagiri nothaving been speciﬁed in the schedule, the provisions of the Act had no application to that area. As above stated,they were prosecuted for committing an oﬀence under section 9(2) read with section 4 with the results abovementioned.The order of acquittal was based on the ground that although the notiﬁcation extended the scope of the ordinanceto area, other than those which were mentioned speciﬁcally in the schedule thereto, it did not extend to thoseareas the provision, of the Act in spite of the application of the provisions of section 25 of the Bombay GeneralClauses Act. In Judgment, the construction placed by the High Court on the language of section 15 is erroneousand full eﬀect has not been given to its provisions or to the provisions of section 25 of the Bombay General ClausesAct. We think on a true construction of section 15 of the Act and section 25 of the Bombay General Clauses Act, thenotiﬁcation issued on 15th January, 1948, under the ordinance continued in force under Act XXXI of 1948 and thatwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/ 20.html/0209595495739524 9/12/2THE STA TE OF BOMBAY V.

It cannot be contended that the notiﬁcation was inconsistent with the provisions of ActXXXI of 1948. It is clearly in accordance with its scheme and purpose. The High Court did not combat theproposition that in view of the provisions of section 25 of the Bombay General Clauses Act the notiﬁcationcontinued in force after the coming into force of the Act. It, however, held that even if the notiﬁcation was taken ashaving been issued under Act XXXI of 1948, the notiﬁcation merely extended the ordinance to these areas and notthe Act. In the opinion of the High Court, the word ""Act "" instead of "" Ordinance "" could not be read in the words ofthe notiﬁcation by the force of section 25 of the Bombay General Clauses Act and the notiﬁcation literallyconstrued, only extended the ordinance to those areas. It was considered that if the intention was to extend theAct to these areas, such an intention could only be carried out by enacting in Act XXXI of 1948 a proviso like theone enacted in the Cotton Cloth and Yarn (Control) Order, 1945, or by use of language similar to the one used insection 9 of the Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904. The proviso in the Cotton Cloth and Yarn (Control) Order is inthese terms:"" Provided further any reference in any order issued under the Defence of India Rules or in anynotiﬁcation issued thereunder to any provision of the Cotton Cloth and Yarn (Control) Order, 1943, shall, unless adiﬀerent intention appears, be construed as reference to the corresponding provision of this Order."" We do notﬁnd it possible to support this line of reasoning. It appears to us that the attention of the learned Judges was notpointedly drawn to the concluding words of section 15 (1) of the Act. It is speciﬁcally provided therein that theprovisions of 778 sections 7 and 25 of the Bombay General Clauses Act shall apply to the repeal as if the ordinancewere an enactment.The ordinance by use of those words was given the status of an enactment and therefore the word ""ordinance""occurring in the notiﬁcation has to be read accordingly and as extending the Act to those areas, and unless that isdone, full eﬀect cannot be given to the 'Concluding words used in section 15(1) of the Act. The concluding words ofsection 15(1) of the Act achieve the purpose that was achieved in the Cotton Cloth and Yarn (Control) Order by the""proviso."" By reason of the deeming provisions of section 15, the language used in the notiﬁcation extending theordinance to those areas as a necessary consequence has the eﬀect of extending the operation of the Act to thoseareas. When a statute enacts that something shall be deemed to have been done, which in fact and truth was notdone, the court is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purposes and between what persons the statutoryﬁction is to be resorted to and full eﬀect must be given to the statutory ﬁction and it should be carried to its logicalconclusion.

March 13. -The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This is a petition under article 32 of theConstitution in which the petitioner seeks redress for what, according to him, is a breach of his fundamental rightsunder articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution. It was argued at considerable length by the petitioner in person.Then, when our judgment was nearly ready, he put in a petition asking for a rehearing and for permission to ﬁlesome fresh papers. When that was refused he came again on another,day and asked for leave to engage an agentand appear through counsel as he felt he had not been able to do justice to his case in person. (It may bementioned that though he had originally engaged an agent he dismissed him before the hearing when heappeared in person.) We granted his request and counsel reargued the case for him but has not carried the matterany further. The facts are these.657 In October,1945, the petitioner was employed by the Government of India on a ﬁve year contracting, theDirectorate General of Resettlement and Employment of the Ministry of Labour. This was after selection by theFederal Public Service Commission. After a short period of practical training, he was posted in January, 1946, atJabalpur as the Manager of the Sub-Regional Employment Exchange and was later conﬁrmed in this appointment.This contract of service was due to expire in 1950.Shortly before its expiration the Government of India made him a new oﬀer, embodied in its letter dated the 30thJune, 1950, to continue him in service on the expiry of his contract on the terms speciﬁed in that letter. Amongthem were the following:(3) Other conditions of service:-On the termination of your contract you will be allowed to continue in your posttemporarily for the period of the Resettlement and Employment Organisation and will be governed by the CentralCivil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1949, unless you are a permanent Government servant."" He was asked inthe letter to intimate to the Ministry of Labour whether he was willing to continue in service on those terms and headmits that he accepted the oﬀer and continued in service, He was not a permanent Government servant though itwas contended in argument that he was, for he was on a ﬁve year contract and the work for which he wasemployed, namely Resettlement and Employment, was itself only of a temporary character. Therefore, theTemporary Service Rules applied.On those rules,' rule 5 is material. It runs as follows:5 (a) The service of a temporary Government servant who is not in quasi-permanent service shall be liable totermination at any time by notice in writing given either by the Government servant to the appointing authority,or by the appointing authority to the Government servant.658 (b) The period of such notice shall be one month, unless otherwise agreed to by the Government and by theGovernment servant."" Quasi-permanent service is deﬁned in-the rules and it is clear that the petitioner does notcome within that class.It is also an undisputed fact that there was no agreement between the petitioner and Government regarding theperiod of the notice. Therefore, according to this rule, which was a term in the petitioner's contract of furtherservice, his services were liable to termination at any time by' one month's notice in writing. This notice was givenon 25th November, 1950, and he was told that his services would terminate on the expiry of one month from 1stDecember, 1950.A large ﬁeld was covered in the course of the arguments, and had the matter not been re-argued we would, for thepetitioner's satisfaction, have dealt with the contentions raised more fully than will be necessary now that counselhas appeared.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/2/9595955rc95www.liiofindia.orasee951.html24 9/12/ 2020SATISH CHANDRA ANAND V. THE UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 21; AIR 13 SC 250; 13 SCR 65 (13 Mah 13)The petition is under article 32(1) of the Constitution and so it must be shown that a fundamental right has beeninfringed. It was argued that the rights infringed are the ones conferred by articles 14 and 16(1).Taking article 14 ﬁrst, it must be shown that the ,petitioner has been discriminated against in the exercise orenjoyment of some legal right which is open to others who are similarly situated. The rights which he says havebeen infringed are those confered by article 31 1. He says he has either been dismissed or removed from servicewithout the safeguards which that article confers. In our opinion, article 31 1 has no application because this isneither a dismissal nor a removal from service, nor is it a reduction in rank. It is an ordinary case of a contract beingtermi- nated by notice under one of its clauses.The services in India have long been aﬀorded certain statutory guarantees and safeguards against arbitrarydismissal or reduction in rank Under 659 section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935, the safeguards werelimited to those two cases. Under. the present Constitution, a third was added, namely removal from service. Inorder to understand the diﬀerence between ""dismissal"" and ""removal"" from service, it will be necessary to turn tothe Rule,; which governed, and with modiﬁcations still govern, the ""services"" in India because of article 313 of theConstitution.Part XII of the Civil Services (Classiﬁcation, Control and Appeal) Rules relating to Conduct and Discipline includesrule 49 which sets out the various penalties to which a member of the services can be subjected for indiscipline andmisconduct. They are seven in number and include censure, suspension, reduction in rank, removal from serviceand dismissal from service. The Act of 1935 selected only two of these possible penalties as serious enough tomerit statutory safeguards, namely reduction in rank and dismissal from service. 'The Constitution has added athird to the list. The distinction which is drawn between the two is explained in rule 49. There is ﬁrst removal fromservice ""which does not disqualify from future employment "" and there is next dismissal from service ""whichordinarily disqualiﬁes from future employment."" Then follows an Explanation:The discharge- (c) of a person engaged under contract, in accordance with the terms of his contract, does notamount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of this rule."" These terms are used in the same sense in article3ll.It follows that the article has no application here and so no question of discrimination arises, for the ""law"" whoseprotection the petitioner seeks has no application to him.There was no compulsion on the petitioner to enter into the contract he did. He was as free under the law as anyother person to accept or to reject the 660 oﬀer which was made to him. Having accepted, he still has open to himall the right-, and remedies available to other persons similarly situated -to enforce any rights under his contractwhich have been denied to him, assuming there are any, and to pursue in the ordinary courts of the land suchremedies for a breach as are open to him to exactly the same extent as other persons similarly situated. He has notbeen discriminated against and he has not been denied the protection of any laws which others similarly situatedcould claim. The remedy of a writ is misconceived.Article 16(1) is equally inapplicable. The whole matter rests in contract. When the petitioner's ﬁrst contract (theﬁve year one) came to an end, he was not a permanent Government servant and Government was not boundeither to re-employ him or to continue him in service. On the other hand, it was open to Government to make himthe oﬀer it did of a continuation of his employment on a temporary and contractual basis. Though theemployment was continued, it was in point of fact, and in the eyes of the law, under a new and fresh contractwhich was quite separate and distinct from the old even though many of its terms were the same.Article 16(1) deals with equality of opportunity in all matters relating to employment or appointment to any oﬃceunder the State. The petitioner has not been denied any opportunity of employment or of appointment. He hasbeen treated just like any other person to whom an oﬀer of temporary employment under these conditions wasmade. His grievance, when analysed, is not one of personal diﬀerentiation but is against an oﬀer of temporaryemployment on special terms as opposed to permanent employment. But of course the State can enter intocontracts of temporary employment and impose special terms in each case, provided they are not inconsistentwith the Constitution, and those who choose to accept those terms and enter into the contract are bound by them,even as the State is bound. When the employment is permanent there are certain statutory guarantees but in theabsence of 661 any such limitations government is, subject to the qualiﬁcation mentioned above, as free to makespecial, contracts of, service with temporary employees, engaged in, works of a temporary nature, as any otheremployer.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/2/9595955rc95www.liiofindia.orasee951.html34 9/12/ 2020SATISH CHANDRA ANAND V.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.-The appellant on 28th July, 1951, wasconvicted on a charge under section 366, Indian Penal Code, for having kidnapped at Poona a minor girl Shilavati inorder that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse and was sentenced to undergo rigorousimprisonment for two years after a trial before the third additional Sessions Judge of that place sitting with a juryof live. The jury returned a verdict of guilty by a majority of three to two. The Sessions Judge came to theconclusion that the verdict was not perverse. He therefore accepted it. The appellant preferred an appeal to theHigh Court 811 but this was summarily dismissed. This appeal is before us by special leave.The prosecution case was that on the 12th December, 1949, the appellant who was a. music teacher went to thehouse of Shilavati and on the pretext that there was a girl waiting in his house and that he' wanted to compare thevoice of Shilavati with the voice of the girl took her to his house, and with the assistance of one Iqbal Putlabai(accused 2) kidnapped her. Shilavati was traced in Bombay after four months in the house of one Babu Konde.Thereafter she was medically examined and it was found that she was pregnant.To prove the case against the appellant the prosecution examined in all sixteen witnesses. Out of these four wereeye-witnesses, viz., Prahlad, Jamunabai, Namdeo and Shilavati. Yamunabai, the mother of Shilavati, stated thaton 12th December when she returned home in the evening she learnt from her sister-in-law Jamunabai and othersthat the appellant had taken Shilavati on the pretext that he wanted to compare her voice with that of one Prabhawho was waiting in his house and thereafter Shilavati had not come back, that on getting this information shealong with her brothers and sister-in-law went to the house of the appellant and questioned him as to whyShilavati was not sent back, whereupon the appellant replied that he had sent her by bus.As Shilavati did not return home, she went to the police and lodged a complaint. Ananda, uncle of the girl,deposed to the same eﬀect. Prahlad, brother of Shilavati, a boy of school-going age, deposed that he saw Shilavatigoing with the appellant while he was playing outside the school.Namdeo, who is a bricklayer, stated that on the 12th December while he was returning after completing his workat about 3-30 p. m. he saw Shilavati going with the appellant.On medical examination it was found that Shilavati was a girl of 15 or 16 years of age and that 'she was pregnant.Shilavati was examined as P, W, 10 and she deposed 105 812 that the accused came to her house at about 3-30p.m. and told her that there was a singing party at Kirkee and that she should accompany him there, that she wentwith him on the promise that the appellant would send her back before her mother returned home, that while atthe appellant's house she was asked to smell certain scents and she felt giddy and could not speak and when shecame to senses in the morning she found herself in Bombay in a hut at Sion. She further said that on enquiry fromone Kassam she was told that the appellant had left her there.On the 12th December at about 11-40 p.m. Yamunabai went to Padamji Gate police station and lodged acomplaint there.In the complaint it was stated that Shilavati had quarrelled with one Shantabai and had left the house and sincethen she had not returned. The police were asked to ﬁnd out her whereabouts. On the 13th she sent a complaint tothe Police Inspector, A Division, Poona. Therein she made the allegation that the appellant used to come to herhouse for coaching Shilavati in harmonium, that she learnt that he had sent a chit to her daughter in her absenceand had called her to his house and that on enquiries about Shilavati's whereabouts he had given evasive answers.The police head- constable who was on duty on receipt of this complaint examined Yamunabai. He read out theapplication to her and recorded her statement which reads thus:- "" My daughter Shilavati age about 13/14 has leftmy house at 4 p.m. I made search for my daughter at the house of my paternal aunt, but I could not ﬁnd her there.M.

She assertedtherein that she was sure that nobody but both M. H. Gyani and Badsha had kidnapped her daughter. In thewitness box Yamuna Bai, as already stated, gave a diﬀerent story and Shilavati herself did not fully support theversion of her mother. On the 14th March, 1950, a letter, Exhibit 4-G, was sent by Shilavati to her mother. Therelevant part of this letter is in these terms:- "" Since last so many days, I have left the house and I have not sent anyletter to you and you must also be worrying as to where I have gone. I am at Bombay and quite well too.Do not worry about me, I had gone to the river at Bamburda, and there some one forced me and brought me toBombay and he was prepared to marry with me. He was an ordinary and old fellow. J did not like it and he wasgoing to convert me ' to Mahomedanism. I felt very sorry for this and I was very much sad. He beat me twice orthrice. To whom shall I express my sorrow ? But there was a boy staying, there whom I told all the facts and toldhim to save me anyhow. He promised to save me. There were two days remaining for my marriage. Till then, hearranged for my stay and also for dinner, and one day before the marriage, previous night he took me out fromthat place. There were many police complaints against him, and he, at the cost of his life, saved me. I married himin order to return his obligations.Now I am very happy, I am not in need of anything now. He is an ordinary boy. He works in a press, and he is aworker. He is from us and his name is Baburao Konde and next 814 time we will send a photograph of both of us.Do not worry about me. I am very happy. Namaskar to all, elderly persons and ashirwadas to youngsters.Namaskar to grandmother Harnabai. Convey namaskars to Anand mama, Vithal mama, Ram mama, Shankar,Prahlad, Laxman, Hirabai, Jamnabai, Yamunabai, Jaibai, and to master."" Shilavati is admittedly a talented Harijangirl who used to take part in dramatic peformances and used to give public peformances in music and dancing onsome remuneration. The letter written by her from Bombay speaks for itself and it was on receipt of this letter andfurther correspondence to which it is not necessary to refer that the police got clue of her where abouts and wereable to restore her to her mother Yamunabai.The statute law in India in certain circumstances permits an appeal against a jury's verdict and authorizes theappellate court to substitute its own verdict on its own consideration of the evidence. It has conferred on theappellate court extensive powers of overruling or modifying the verdict of a jury in the interests of dueadministration of justice conﬁdent that the appellate judges who have not themselves seen and heard thewitnesses, will not exercise lightly the responsible power entrusted to them. Section 423 in sub-section (2),Criminal Procedure Code, states as follows:- "" Nothing herein contained shall authorize the court to alter orreverse the verdict of a jury unless it is of opinion that such verdict is erroneous owing to a misdirection by thejudge or to a misunderstanding on the part of the jury of the law as laid down by him. "" Section 537 in sub-clause(d) provides that no ﬁnding, sentence or order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed oraltered on appeal on account of any misdirection in any charge to the jury 816 unless such error, omission,irregularity or misdirection has in fact occasioned a failure of justice. Unless therefore it is established in a casethat there has been a serious misdirection by the judge in charging. the jury which has occasioned a failure ofjustice and has misled the jury in giving its verdict the verdict of the jury cannot be set aside. The learned counselfor the appellant contended that the judge in his charge to the jury misdirected it in several important particularsand violated the rules of criminal jurisprudence and of evidence in a number of ways.It was said that he failed to warn the jury that it would be unsafe for it to act on the statement of Shilavati withouther statement being corroborated by other evidence,in material particulars. The judge, according to the learnedcounsel, should have told the jury that though in law it was open to them if in the circumstances of this case theythought ﬁt to do, to act on the uncorroborated testimony of Shilavati but that ordinarily it was not safe to do sowithout that statement being corroborated in material particulars. This omission on the part. of the judge, it wasurged, amounted in law to a grave misdirection and the jury in all likelihood without such a warning arrived at itsverdict on the basis of the uncorroborated evidence of the girl. That part of the charge in which reference wasmade by the judge to Shilavati's evidence wherein she had said that she was told by Kassam Khan that theappellant had left her there was criticized on the ground that the jury bad been directed to act on inadmissibleevidence. Then it was contendad that it was a serious misdirection to direct the jury that it had to solve the jigsawpuzzle that had arisen in the case by using their own ingenuity and by piecing together the various pieces of thepuzzle. The last misdirection relied upon concerned the following part of the charge:- ""After weighing theprobabilities of the case, the evidence on record, as prudent men if you come to the conclusion that the storygiven by the prosecution does not appear to be probable and that the 816 accused must not have committed theoﬀence, then in that case you have to return a verdict of not guilty."" In our judgment, it is not necessary tog/in/cs/cn/IC/13/2/MUSHTUSSEIHTT1953NS95895Carc95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS956.html37 9/12/ 2020AK HN V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY [] IC 26; AIR 13 SC 22; 13 SR 80 9 (30 Mh 13)pronounce on all the points urged by the learned counsel, because we are of the opinion that the judge clearlymisdirected the jury when he asked it to solve the problem that had arisen by exercising its ingenuity and byresorting, if necessary, to speculative reasoning. In other words, the judge gave the jury a carte blanche to, cometo its conclusion on the basis of its own conjectures, if necessary. Not only that. He told the jury to hold theaccused not guilty in case it found it improbable that he must not have committed the oﬀence. These propositionsplaced before the jury are repugnant to all notions of criminal jurisprudence and they must necessarily haveaﬀected its mind in arriving at the conclusion. This is how the charge on this point reads:- "" So you will ﬁnd,gentlemen, that there are as many as six versions before this court and therefore you have to consider all theseversions and probabilities of the case, to ﬁnd out whether the improved version now before the court is a correctone. I would like also to bring to your notice the letter written at the instance of Shilavati from Bombay. That letteris Exhibit 4-G. Shilavati in her examination before the court does not admit that this letter was written at herinstance. However, she has admitted before the police that this letter was written at her instance, and this wasbrought out in her cross-examination.In this letter she had stated that she had gone on that day to Bamburda river and there she was forcibly kidnappedby some man who was about to marry her. That man was an old man and she did not approve that marriage.Fortunately, this Konde came to her rescue and took her to Bombay and married her. That is her statement. Now,gentlemen, this is a jigsaw puzzle kept before you. In jigsaw puzzles all the pieces are kept before us and we haveto use our ingenuity and piece them together. Some 817 links are missing in this case. However, as rightly sub-mitted by the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor, in such cases you have to weigh the probabilities of the caseand therefore you have to ﬁnd out from the material before us whether you can solve this jigsaw puzzle. Nowthese points are before you that there was a quarrel with Shantabai. The chit was alleged to have been sent byaccused No. 1, and then the girl went to Bamburda river and there she was kidnapped by somebody. Now,gentlemen, you have to consider whether it is or it is not possible that the girl Shilavati might have received somachit probably from the accused No.1. This chit was seen by Shantabai who exposed to Harnabai the grandmother of the girl. The witness Harnabai isan old woman and probably she was put out and ;he might have taken her to task, and she might have even goneto the length of stating that she should go out of the house. Here is a young girl having hot blood, and it is or is itnot probable that the girl in desperation had gone to Bamburda, and she mentions the river, and gentlemen, youcan ﬁnd that there is a conﬂuence of the rivers Mula and Mutha; why did she go to the river ? Whether it isprobable that she wanted to commit suicide. You will ﬁnd, gentlemen, that near that conﬂuence there is a mosqueand in the evidence it has come out that the girl was found at the hut at Sion with an old Mahommedan namedKassam Khan and his keep. You have to consider whether it is probable that this Kassam Khan and his keepinduced the girl to go with them to Bombay and whether Kassam Khan wanted to marry her there. You have toﬁnd out whether it is probable that this chivalrous man Konde rescued her from the old man Kassam Khan whowas about to marry her and got himself married to the girl. The fact remains that the girl was found with Konde inBombay ultimately. It is in evidence of the girl herself that she found herself in a hut at Sion and Kassam Khan andhis keep were keeping a watch over her........................ So, gentlemen, you Will have to ﬁnd out all theprobabilities of the case and 818 before us by the prosecution.."" Had the charge to the jury stopped with thesentence, ""So you will ﬁnd, gentlemen, that there are as many as six versions before this court and therefore youhave to consider all these versions and probabilities of the case, to ﬁnd out whether the improved version nowbefore the court is a correct one"", no exception could possibly have been taken to it. When the learned judgehowever, proceeded to direct the jury to piece together the various pieces of the jigsaw puzzle by use of theiringenuity he clearly misdirected them inasmuch as he told them that they could in' solving the problem draw upontheir own imagination and exercise their ingenuity in the matter without reference to the evidence that had beenplaced by the prosecution on the record. Not only that, the learned judge himself indulged in speculation andplaced a number of conjectures before the jury for its consideration. The learned judge surmised that the girlmight well have gone to the river for committing suicide and asked the jury to consider this surmise as well.It was further surmised that a chit from the accused was received by Shilavati and that Shantabai saw that chit,and disclosed it to Harnabai, the grandmother, who in all likelihood took her to task and told her to get out of thehouse and thereupon the hot-blooded Shilavati went to the river to commit suicide. There is no evidencewhatsoever on the record about the actual receipt of that chit, of Shantabai seeing it and exposing this fact toHarnabai and of Harnabai threatening Shilavati. All these considerations mentioned to the jury were the results ofthe judge's fertile imagination and were bound to mislead it into the belief that they could indulge in likeconjectures and surmises in their eﬀort to solve the puzzle. The direction to the jury that it was to solve the jigsawpuzzle by use of its ingenuity does not ﬁnd place in an isolated passage of the charge, but runs through it.

TE SAE OF BOMBAY [] IC 26; AIR 13 SC 22; 13 SR 80 9 (30 Mh 13)winding up the learned judge again reiterated it and Said;- 819 ""As I have already told you, you have to piecetogether all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle and try to., ﬁnd out what story appears to you to be probable; whetherthe girl was drugged at all, or whether as stated by her in her letter she went to a river at Bamburda and there shemet this Kassam Khan and his keep and along with them she went to Bombay of her own accord."" In theconcluding part of the charge the learned judge said:- ""After weighing the probabilities of the case, evidence onrecord, as prudent men if you come to the conclusion that the story given by the prosecution does not appear tobe probable and that the accused must not have committed the oﬀence, then in that case you have to return averdict of not guilty."" It is not possible say that these words were likely to give a correct lead to the jury in reachingits conclusion. All that the jury should have been told was that after weighing the probabilities of the case and theevidence on the record, as prudent men they should answer ""whether the prosecution had made out the chargeagainst the accused."" We are satisﬁed that as a result of These misdirections the jury in all likelihood gave a dividedverdict of guilty by three to two not on evidence but on the basis of assumptions and conjectures.In this situation, the question for consideration is what procedure should be followed by this court for undoing themischief that has happened and which would be most conducive to the ends of justice. The simplest course opento us is to order a retrial of the appellant. It is also open to us to remit the case to the High Court with a directionthat it should consider the merits of the case in the light of our decision and say whether there has been a failure ofjustice as a result of these misdirections. Lastly it is open to us to examine the merits of the case and 106 820decide for ourselves whether there has been a failure of justice in the case and an innocent man has beenconvicted.It is now well settled that in deciding whether there has been in fact a failure of justice in consequence of amisdirection the court is entitled to take the whole case into consideration. [ Vide Abdul Rahim v. Emperor(1)]. Thewords ""in fact"" in section 637 (d), Criminal Procedure Code, emphasize the view that the court is entitled to go intothe evidence itself in order to determine whether there has been a failure of justice. In the peculiar circumstancesof this case we have chosen to adopt the third course, because at this moment of time it is most conducive to theends of justice. It seems plain to us that on the material on this record no reasonable body of persons couldpossibly have arrived at the conclusion that the appellant kidnapped Shilavati as alleged by the prosecution. Wehave taken upon ourselves the responsibility of deciding this case without the valuable opinion of the High Courtbecause we feel satisﬁed that any other course would cause unnecessary harassment to the appellant. With greatrespect we are, however constrained to observe that it was not right for the High Court to have dismissed theappeal preferred by the appellant to that court summarily, as it certainly raised some arguable points whichrequired consideration though we have not thought it ﬁt to deal with all of them. In cases which prima facie raiseno arguable issue that course is, of course, justiﬁed, but this court would appreciate it if in arguable cases thesummary rejection order gives some indication of the views of the High Court on the points raised. Without theopinion of the High Court on such points in special leave petitions under article 136 of the Constitution this Courtsometimes feels embarrassed if it has to deal with those matters without the beneﬁt of that opinion.(1) A.I.R. 1946 P.C.821 The, learned Solicitor-General contended that this was not a ﬁt case where the court was justiﬁed in goingbehind the verdict of the jury and in deciding the case in accordance with its own view of the evidence. It wasargued that the charge to the jury had to be taken as a whole, that though some slight exception might be takento certain passages in the charge the learned judge had placed the case of both sides fairly before the jury and thatnot only did the learned judge place fairly the case of both sides before the jury, he indicated his opinion on theevidence strongly against the prosecution and that being so, the accused could not be allowed to say that thecharge which was strongly in his favour and against the prosecution was defective in law.It was said that it was open to the jury to accept the statement of the mother of the girl as well as the statement ofthe girl in spite of the diﬀerent conﬂicting versions mentioned in the charge and that the jury having done so, thematter stood concluded.As already observed, charge to the jury cannot be said to be a fair charge if it tells the jury to approach the decisionof the matter from a wrong angle, and directs it to reach its decision by exercise of its own ingenuity and by havingrecourse to conjectures and speculative reasoning.This convention of the learned Solicitor-General therefore cannot be seriously considered.g/in/cs/cn/IC/13/2/MUSHTUSSEIHTT1953NS95895Carc95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS956.html57 9/12/ 2020AK HN V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY [] IC 26; AIR 13 SC 22; 13 SR 80 9 (30 Mh 13)That the verdict of the jury was erroneous in that it could not be the verdict of any body of reasonable men in thecircumstances of this case is fully established by the facts and circumstances on the record. What Yamunabaideposed in court has been set out in the earlier part of this judgment. Her case now is that when she returnedhome on the 12th December, 1949, at about 6-30 p.m., she found that Shilavati was not in the house, she madeenquiries from Jamna and Hira, she was told that accused 1 came and told them that there was a girl in his houseand her voice was to be compared with Shilavati's voice and took her 822 away on that pretext. Prahlad, P.W. 4,deposed that when his mother returned home at 6 p.m. he told her that Shilavati had been seen by him in thecompany of accused 1.Jamnabai, P.W. 5, stated that the accused came to the house at 3 p.m. and on the pretext that one girl had come tohis house for singing he took Shilavati and that when Yamunabai returned she informed her of what hadhappened. Ananda, P.W. 6, repeated the same story. This story stands completely demolished by the diﬀerentcomplaints that Yamunabai made to the police. There is no satisfactory explanation whatsoever why when shemade her ﬁrst report to the police at 11-40 p.m. she did not tell the police that she had been told by her son, byJamuna and by Namdev that the girl had been taken away by the appellant and that he had told them that she hadbeen sent back in a bus. Not only this, after she had sent a written complaint on the 13th December to the PoliceInspector, Poona, suspecting the appellant of having kidnapped her daughter, she made a statement to the head-constable, withdrawing that allegation in most unambiguous terms and stated that the girl had left the house afterquarrelling with Harnabai. In the ﬁrst report to the police she had said that the girl had left after quarrelling withone Shantabai. These statements made by her could not be said to be the result of mere ﬁgments of her brain. Shemust have made them on some basis. They give the lie direct to her present version. When later on she sent anapplication to the Collector accusing the appellant and Badsha of having kidnapped her daughter she.asserted that they had taken her away to an unknown.place at 6 p. m., though the occurrence in then earliercomplaints was alleged to have taken place at about 3-30 p. m. The letter of 14th March, 1960, written at theinstance of Shilavati to Yamunabai falsiﬁes all the versions given by her and clearly suggests that the girl left thehouse of her own accord. In this letter she sent her regards to the appellant. If he had kidnapped, her, thatexpression of respect would 823 not have found place in that letter at all Another version was mentioned in theevidence as to how the occurrence took place. It was stated that the girl received a chit from the appellant and. onthe basis of this chit a quarrel ensued and the girl left the house. On this state of the record it is quite evident thatthe version now given by Yamunabai to court or by Shilavati after she had come under the inﬂuence of her mothercannot be accepted. It seems that the appellant because he was a music master and had been giving lessons to thegirl a few months before her disappearance has been convicted on a charge under section 366, Indian Penal Code,'not on the basis of evidence but on the basis of surmises and, conjectures. The learned Solicitor-General referredus to the statement of the bricklayer and of the boy Prahlad. A mere reading of their statements shows that theseare not true and have been procured to ﬁll in gaps in the prosecution case. Harnabai was not produced as a witnessin the case and the learned judge in his charge to the jury was right when he observed that a number of links weremissing in the prosecution case and they could only be ﬁlled in on the basis of conjectures. Both Yamunabai andPrahlad studiously avoided stating that the girl took part in dramas or that she danced in public places. They triedto make out that Shilavati was an unsophisticated girl having no knowledge of the world and that she neverdanced in public places or she never acted in public dramas. There is ample material on the record consisting of herphotos in the advertisements as well as in the statements made to the police which establishes that she acted invarious dramas for which she was paid at the rate of Rs. 5 for each perfor- mance and that she gave, danceperformances and she was intending to make singing and dancing as her profession. The very fact that the brotherand the mother were at pains to create a false impression on the court by deposing falsely was itself suﬃcient toshow that no reliance could be placed on their 824 testimony. We are therefore ﬁrmly of the opinion that there hasbeen a grave failure of justice in this *case and the appellant, an innocent man, has been convicted of a seriousoﬀence on a verdict of the jury arrived at in all likelihood on the basis of conjectures and that that verdict was the.consequence of the misdirection given to the jury by the judge.For the reasons given above we allow this appeal, set aside the verdict of the jury, and acquit the appellant of theoﬀence with which he was charged.Appeal allowed.Agent for the appellant: V.

It invalidates -only those provisions which are inconsistent with the fundamental rightsguaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.Further, the fact that trial was continued even after 26th January, 1950, under the earlier Regulation which is insome respects discriminatory would not necessarily render the subsequent proceedings invalid. All that theaccused could claim is that what remains of the trial must not deviate from the normal standard in materialrespects, so as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of laws within the meaning of Art. 14 of theConstitution. For the purpose. of determining whether the accused was deprived of such protection, the Court -has to see ﬁrst of all whether after eliminating the discriminatory provisions in the Regulation, it was still possibleto secure to the accused substantially the beneﬁts of a trial under the ordinary law; and if so, whether that wasactually done in the particular case.On the 5th January, 1950, the case of the accused who was charged with murder, arson, rioting and other oﬀenceswhich was pending before a Special Tribunal was made over to a Special Judge in pursuance of the provisions ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/959589569595817 9/12/ 2020HABEEB MOHAME D V.

The trialcommenced on the 11th February, 1950, after the new Constitution came into force and the accused was convictedand sentenced to death. His appeal was dismissed and the sentence of death was ultimately conﬁrmed by theHigh Court. It was contended that the entire trial was illegal inasmuch as the Regulation under which the accusedwas tried contained several provisions which were in conﬂict with the equal protection clause (Art. 14) of theConstitution and became void after the 26th January 1950.Held, (1) The provisions in the Regulation eliminating committal proceedings and substituting the warrantprocedure for -sessions procedure in the trial of oﬀences did not render the trial illegal as the committalproceeding was not an indispensable preliminary to a sessions trial under the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code.(2) On a proper interpretation of s. 8 of the Regulation the right of an accused to apply for transfer of his case wasnot taken away and the right of revision was taken away only in respect of non-appealable sentences.(3)Section 8 of the Regulation was void in so far as it took away the provisions relating to conﬁrmation ofsentences but as this part of the Regulation was severable from the remaining 663 portion of the section theprovisions of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code relating to conﬁrmation of sentences could be followed, andthose provisions did not in any way aﬀect the procedure for trial laid down in the Regulation.(4)The fact that the Nizam's consent had not been obtained could not vitiate the trial as such consent is necessaryonly before execution of the sentence.Held also, that the delegation of the authority of the Chief Minister to make over cases for trial to the SpecialJudge, by a general notiﬁcation authorising all civil administrators of the districts to exercise within theirrespective jurisdictions the powers of the Chief Minister under s. 5 (b) was not invalid.

The oﬀences were alleged to have been committed on orabout the 9th of December, 1947, and the First Information Report 664 was lodged, a considerable timeafterwards, on 31st January, 1949. On 28th August, 1949, there was an order in terms of section 3 of the SpecialTribunal Regulation No. V of 1358 F., which was in force at that time, directing the appellant to be tried by theSpecial Tribunal (A). The accused being a public oﬃcer, the sanction of the Military Governor was necessary toprosecute him and this sanction was given on 20th September, 1949. On 13th December, 1949, a new Regulation,being Regulation No. X of 1359F., was passed by the Hyderabad Government which ended the Special Tribunalscreated under the previous Regulation on and from 16th December, 1949 ; and consequently upon suchtermination pro- vided for the appointment, power and procedure of Special Judges.

The trial commenced on and from 11th February, 1950, andaltogether 21 witnesses were examined for the prosecution and one for 665 the defence. The Special, Judge, by hisjudgment dated the 8th of May, 1950, convicted the appellant of all the oﬀences with which he was charged andsentenced him to death under section 243 of the Hyderabad Penal Code (corresponding to section 302 of theIndian Penal Code) and to various terms of imprisonment under sections 248, 368, 282 and 124 of the Code ofHyderabad (which correspond respectively to sections 307, 436,342 and 148 of the Indian Code). Against thisjudgment the appellant took an appeal to the High Court of Hyderabad and the appeal was ﬁrst heard by aDivision Bench consisting of Shripat Rao and S.Ali Khan JJ. On 29th September, 1950, the learned Judges delivered diﬀering judgments, Shripat Rao J. taking theview that the appeal should be dismissed, while the other learned Judge expressed the opinion that the appealought to be allowed and the accused acquitted. The case was then referred to Mr. Justice Manohar Prasad, as athird Judge and by his judgment dated the 11th of December, 1960, the learned Judge agreed with the opinion ofShripat Rao J. and dismissed the appeal upholding the conviction and sentences passed by the Special Judge. Theappellant then presented an application for leave to appeal to this court. That application was rejected by the HighCourt of Hyderabad, but special leave to appeal was granted by this court on 11th May, 1951, and it is on thestrength of this special leave that the appeal has come before us.The present hearing of the appeal is conﬁned to certain constitutional points which have been raised by theappellant attacking the legality of the entire trial which resulted in his conviction on the ground that the procedurefor trial laid down in Regulation X of 1359F. became void after the 26th of January, 1960, by reason of its being inconﬂict with the equal protection clause embodied in article 14 of the Constitution. These grounds have been setforth in a separate petition ﬁled by the appellant under article 32 of the Constitution and following the procedureadopted in the case of Qasim Razvi [ Case No. 276 666 of 1951(1)],we decided to hear arguments on the con-stitutional questions as,preliminary points in the appeal itself. Whether the appeal would have to be heard furtheror not would depend on the decision which we arrive at in the present hearing.The substantial contention put forward by Mr. Peerbhoy, who appeared in support of the appeal, is that as theprocedure for trial prescribed by Regulation X of 1359F.deviated to a considerable extent from the normal procedure laid down by the general law and deprived theaccused of substantial beneﬁts to which otherwise he would have been entitled, -the Regulation became voidunder article 13(1) of the Constitution on and from the 26th of January, 1950 The conviction and the sentencesresulting from the procedure thus adopted must, therefore, be held illegal and inoperative and the judgment ofthe Special Judge as well as of the High Court should be quashed. The other point raised by the learned counsel isthat the making over of the case of the appellant to the Special Judge was illegal as the authority to make oversuch cases was not properly delegated by the Chief Minister to the Civil Administrator in the mannercontemplated by section 5 of the Regulation.As regards the ﬁrst point, it is to be noted at the out- set that the impugned Regulation was a pre-Constitutionstatute. In determining the validity or otherwise of such legislation on the ground of any of its provisions beingrepugnant to the equal protection clause, two principles would have to be borne in mind, which were enunciatedby the majority of this court in the case of Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad (1), decided on the 19th ofJanuary, 1953, where the earlier decision in Lachman Das Kewalram v.The State of Bombay(1) was discussed and explained.Firstly, the Constitution has no retrospective eﬀect and even if the law is in any sense discriminatory, it must beheld to be valid for all past transactions and for enforce- ment of rights and liabilities accrued before the (1) [ 1953]S.C.R. 589. (2) [ 1952] INSC 30; [ 1952] S.C.R. 710.667 coming into force of the Constitution. Secondly, article 13(1) of the Constitution does not necessarily make thewhole statute invalid even after the advent of the Constitution. It invalidates only those provisions which areinconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. The statute becomes voidonly to the extent of such inconsistency but otherwise remains valid and operative. As was said in Qasim Razvi'scase(1) the fact that "" trial was continued even after 26th January, 1950, under the same Regulation would notwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/959589569595837 9/12/ 2020HABEEB MOHAME D V. THE ST A TE OF HY DERABAD [13] INSC 28; AIR 13 S C 27; 13 SCR 61 (30 March 13)neces- sarily render the subsequent proceedings invalid. All that the accused could claim is that what remained ofthe trial must not deviate from the normal standard in material respects, so as to amount to a denial of the equalprotection of laws within the meaning of article 14 of the Constitution. For the purpose of determining whetherthe accused was deprived of such protection, we have to see ﬁrst of all whether after eliminating thediscriminatory provisions in the Regulation, it was still possible to secure to the accused substantially the beneﬁtsof a trial under the ordinary law; and if so, whether that was actually done in the particular case."" As has beenstated already, the Special Judge took cognizance of this case on the 5th of January, 1950,' which was prior to theadvent of the Constitution. It must be held, therefore, that the Special Judge was lawfully seized of the case, and itis not possible to say that the appointment of a Special Judge was in itself an inequality.in the eye of the law. The trial undoubtedly commenced from the 11th of February, 1950, that is to say, subsequentto the coming into force of the Constitution, and the question that requires consideration is, whether theprocedure that was actually followed by the Special Judge acting under the impugned Regulation did give theaccused the substance of a normal trial, or, in other words, whether he had been given a fair measure of equality inthe matter of procedure ? (1) [ 1953] S.C.R. 589.668 Mr. Peerbhoy lays stress on two sets of provisions in the impugned Regulation which, according to him,diﬀerentiate the procedure prescribed in it from that laid down under the ordinary law. The ﬁrst set relates to theelimination of the committal proceeding and the substitution of warrant procedure for the sessions procedure inthe trial of oﬀences. The other set-of provisions consists of those which deny to the accused the rights of revisionand transfer and withdraw from him the safeguards relating to conﬁrmation of sentences. The ﬁrst branch of thecontention, in our opinion, is unsustainable having regard to our decision in Qasim Razvi's case(1). It was pointedout in that case that under the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code the committal proceeding,is not anindispensable preliminary to a sessions trial. Under section 267A of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code, theMagistrate is quite competent, either without recording any evidence or after recording only a portion of theevidence, to commit an accused for trial by the sessions court if, in his opinion, there are suﬃcient grounds forsuch committal. If the committal proceeding is left out of account as not being compulsory, and its absence did notoperate to take away the jurisdiction of the Special Judge to take cognizance of the case before the Constitution,the diﬀerence between a warrant procedure prescribed by the impugned Regulation to be followed by the SpecialJudge after such cognizance was taken and the sessions procedure at that stage applicable under the general lawis not at all substantial, and the minor diﬀerences would not bring the case within the mischief of article 14 of theConstitution. This question having been already decided in Qasim Razvi's case(1) it is not open for furtherarguments in the present one.With regard to the other set of provisions, the contention of Mr. Peerbhoy is based entirely upon the language ofsection 8 of the Regulation. In our opinion, the interpretation which the learned counsel seeks to put upon thesection is not quite correct, (1) [ 1953] S.C.R. 589.669 and it seems to us that not only the right of an accused to apply for transfer of his case has not been takenaway by this section, but the right of revision also has been left unaﬀected except to a small extent.Section 8 of the Regulation X of 1359 F. is in these terms:- ""All the provisions of section 7 of the said Regulationshall have eﬀect in relation to sentences passed by a Special Judge as if every reference in the said Regulation to aSpecial Tribunal included a reference to a Special Judge."" The expression ""said Regulation"" means and refers toRegulation V of 1358 F. and section 7 of the said Regulation provides inter alia that ""there shall save as here inbefore provided, be no appeal from any order or sentence passed by a Special Tribunal, and no court shall haveauthority to revise such order or sentence or to transfer any case from Special Tribunal or have any jurisdiction ofany kind in respect of any proceeding before a Special Tribunal and no sentence of a Special Tribunal shall besubject to or submitted for conﬁrmation by any authority whatsoever."" It will be noticed that what section 8 of theimpugned Regula- tion does, is to incorporate, not the whole of section 7 of the previous Regulation, but only suchportion of it as relates to sentences passed by a Special Judge. By ""sentence"" is meant obviously the ﬁnal ordeﬁnitive pronouncement of the criminal court which culminates or ends in a sentence as opposed to an ""order"",interlocutory or otherwise, where no question of inﬂiction' of any sentence is involved. The scope of section 7 ofthe earlier Regulation is thus much wider than that of present section 8 and all the limitations of the earlier statutehave not been repeated in the present one. The result, therefore, is that revision against any order which has hotended in a sentence is not interdicted by the present Regulation, nor has the right of applying for transfer, whichhas no reference to a sentence, been touched at all. These rights are expressly- preserved by section 10 of thepresent 87 670 Regulation, which makes the Code of Criminal 'Procedure applicable in all matters except where theRegulation has provided otherwise. Reading section 8 of the present Regulation with section 7 of the earlier one, itwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/959589569595847 9/12/ 2020HABEEB MOHAME D V. THE ST A TE OF HY DERABAD [13] INSC 28; AIR 13 S C 27; 13 SCR 61 (30 March 13)may be held that what has been taken away from an accused is, in the ﬁrst place, the right of revision against non-appealable sentences, and in the second- place, -the provisions relating -to conﬁrmation of sentences. The ﬁrstone is immaterial for our present purpose, as no question of any non-appealable sentence arises in the case beforeus. The second is undoubtedly a discriminatory feature and naturally Mr. Peerbhoy has laid considerable stressupon it.Section 20 of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code lays down the rule relating to conﬁrmation of sentences inthe following manner:Every Sessions Judge may pass any sentence authorised by law, but such sentence shall not be carried into eﬀectuntil (1) in the case of a sentence of 10 years 'impri- sonment or more, the appropriate Bench of the High Court;(2) in the case of life imprisonment, the Government; and (3) in the case of death sentence, H.E.H. the Nizam, shallhave assented thereto. Section 302 provides that when a sessions court as passe a sentence of death 'or of lifeimprisonment or of imprisonment exceeding 10 years, the ﬁle of the case shall be forwarded to the High Court andthe execution of the sentence stayed until manjuri is given in accordance with section 20. Section 307 furtherprovides that when the High Court has aﬃrmed a death sentence or sentence of life imprisonment, then itsopinion together with the ﬁle of the case shall be forwarded' for ratiﬁcation to the Government within one weekand the sentence shall not be carried into eﬀect until after the assent thereon of H.E.H. the Nizam in the case ofdeath sentences and of the Government in the case of 671 sentences of life imprisonment. Mr. Peerbhoy'scomplaint is that the sentence imposed upon his client has, in the present case, neither been' conﬁrmed by theHigh Court, nor by H.E.H. the Nizam. This, he says, is a discrimination which has vitally prejudiced his client anddoes aﬀord a ground for setting aside the sentence in its entirety.It. admits of no dispute that section 8 of Regulation X of 1359F. must be held to be invalid under articles 13(1) and14 of the Constitution to the I extent that it takes away the provision relating to conﬁrmation of sentences as iscontained in the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code. This, however, is a severable part of the section and beinginvalid, the provisions of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code with regard to the conﬁrmation of sentencesmust be followed. Those provisions, however, do not aﬀect in any way the procedure for trial laid down in theRegulation.All that section 20 of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code lays down is that sentences of particular descriptionshould not be executed unless assent of certain authorities to the same is obtained. The proper stage, therefore,when this, section comes into operation. is the stage of the execution of the sentence. The trial or conviction ofthe accused is not aﬀected in any way by reason of the withdrawal of the provision relating to conﬁrmation ofsentences in the Regulation. The withdrawal is certainly inoperative and in spite of such withdrawal the accusedcan insist on the rights provided 'for under the general law.In the case before us the records show that no reference was made by the Special Judge after he passed thesentence of death upon the appellant in the manner contemplated by section 307 of the Hyderabad Code, whichcorresponds to section 374 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. There was, however, an appeal preferred by theaccused and the entire ﬁle of the case came up before the High Court in that connection. As said already, theDivision Bench, which heard the appeal, was divided in its 672 opinion and consequently no question ofconﬁrmation of the death sentence could or did arise before that Bench. The question was, however, speciﬁcallyraised towards the conclusion of the arguments before the third Judge, to whom it was referred; and it issigniﬁcant to note that some time before that a Full Bench of the Hyderabad High Court had decided that theprovision in the Regulation relating to conﬁrmation of sentences was void and inoperative and consequently inspite of the said provision the sentences were required to be conﬁrmed in accordance with the general law. Thequestion was then raised whether the conﬁrmation was to be made by the third Judge alone or it had to be doneby the two Judges who agreed in dismissing the appeal. Mr.Justice Manohar Prasad decided that as the whole case was referred to him, he alone was competent to make theorder for conﬁrmation of the death sentence and he did actually conﬁrm it by writing out in his own hand the orderpassing the sentence of death according to the provision laid down in the Hyderabad Code. Mr. Peerbhoycontends that this conﬁrmation was illegal and altogether invalid as not being made in conformity with theprovisions of the Hyderabad Code. We do not want to express any opinion on this point at the present moment.There appears on the face of the record an order for conﬁrmation of the death sentence made by a Judge of theHigh Court. If this order is not in conformity with the provisions of law, the question may be raised before thiswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/959589569595857 9/12/ 2020HABEEB MOHAME D V. THE ST A TE OF HY DERABAD [13] INSC 28; AIR 13 S C 27; 13 SCR 61 (30 March 13)court when the appeal comes up for hearing I on its merits. This is, however, not a matter which aﬀects theconstitutional question with which only we are concerned at the present stage.Under section 20 of the Hyderabad Code, as mentioned above, a death sentence could not be executed unless theassent of H.E.H. the Nizam was obtained. Mr. Peerbhoy points out that this has not been done in the present case.To that the obvious reply is that consent of H.E.H. the Nizam is necessary only before the sentence is executed,and that stage apparently 673 has, not arrived as yet. The ﬁnal judgment of the High Court in this case was passedon 11th December, 1950. There was an application for leave to appeal presented by the accused immediately afterthat date and this application was rejected on 2nd January, 1951. On the 5th of February, 1951, an application forspecial leave was made to this court and the execution of the death sentence was stayed during this period underorders of the High Court itself.The special leave was granted by this court on 11th May, 1951, and the carrying out of the death sentence has beenstayed since then under our orders, pending the disposal of the appeal. The question as to whether any furtherconﬁrmation by H.E.H. the Nizam is necessary could only arise if and when the death sentence passed by thecourts below is upheld by this court. Mr. Peerbhoy points out that since the 1st April, 1951, the Indian CriminalProcedure Code has been introduced in the State of Hyderabad and there is no power in the Nizam now to conﬁrma sentence of death, although such conﬁrmation was necessary at the time when the sentence-was pronouncedboth by the Special Judge as well as by the High Court on appeal. We do not think that it is at all necessary for us atthe present stage to discuss the eﬀect of this change of law. If the assent of the Nizam to the execution of a deathsentence is a matter of procedure, it may be argued that the procedural law which obtains at the present momentis the proper law to be applied. On the other hand, if it was a question of substantive right, it may be open tocontention that the law which governed the parties at the date when the trial began is still applicable. We are,however, not called upon to express any opinion on this point and we deliberately decline to do so. We also do notexpress any opinion as to whether the rights which could be exercised by the Nizam under section 20 of theHyderabad Criminal Procedure Code were appurtenant to his prerogative as a sovereign or were statutory rightsexercisable by the person designated in the statute. These matters 674 may be considered when the appeal comesup for ﬁnal hearing on the merits. Our conclusion is that there has not been any discrimination in matters ofprocedure in this case which can be said to, have aﬀected f the trial prejudicially against the accused and theaccused is not entitled to 'have his conviction and sentence set aside on that ground.The other question raised by the appellant relates to delegation of the authority by the Chief Minister to makeover cases for trial by the Special Judge. Mr. Peerbhoy lays 'stress on section 5 (b) of the Regulation which speaksof oﬀences being "" made over to the Special Judge for trial by the Chief Minister or by a person authorised by thechief Minister in this behalf "", and it is argued that this section requires that the delegatee is to be mentioned byname. What the Chief Minister has done is that he issued a notiﬁcation authorising all civil administrators of thedistricts to exercise within their respective jurisdictions the powers of the Chief Minister under the said section.This, it is argued, is not in compliance with the provisions of the section. We do not think there is any substance inthis contention. The delegates can certainly be described by reference to his oﬃcial designation and the authoritymay be vested in the holder of a particular oﬃce for the time being. This, we think, is quite a proper andconvenient way of delegating the powers which are exercisable by the Chief Minister. In our opinion, theconstitutional points raised by Mr. Peerbhoy fail. The application under article 32 of the Constitution is thusrejected and the case is directed to be posted in the usual course for being heard on its merits.GHULAM HASAN J.-I concur in the order proposed by my learned brother Mr. Justice Mukherjea that the petitionunder article 32 of the Constitution be dismissed, but I deem it necessary to make a few observations in view of mydissenting judgment in Qasim Razvi's case(1). The majority judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Mukherjea on the.19th January, 1953, in (1) [ 1952] S-C-R, 710.675 Qasim Razvi's case(1) while interpreting the decision in Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja v. The State ofBombay(1) laid, down the principle that the mere fact that some of the provisions of the impugned Regulation arediscriminatory on the face of it, is not suﬃcient to render the trial and the conviction void under article 14, readwith article 13 (1) of the Constitution and that in such cases where the trial is continued after the 26th January,1950, under the impugned Regulation, it is necessary to see whether the procedure followed after the materialdate was such as deprived the accused of the equal protection of laws within the meaning of article 14 of theConstitution and that if the accused under such procedure received substantially the beneﬁts of the trial under thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/2.html/959589569595867 9/12/ 2020HABEEB MOHAME D V. THE ST A TE OF HY DERABAD [13] INSC 28; AIR 13 S C 27; 13 SCR 61 (30 March 13)ordinary law, the trial and conviction cannot be held as void and illegal. I take it that the majority decision isbinding and that the principle enunciated by the majority is no longer open to question.With this preliminary observation I must proceed to express my concurrence generally with the view taken by mylearned brother Mr. Justice Mukherjea in the present case.It is to be borne in mind that Regulation V of 1358 F.under which the Tribunal was constituted to try Qasim Razvi's case was in material respects diﬀerent fromRegulation X of 1359 F. under which the Special Judge tried the petitioner Habeeb Mohammad. I agree with mylearned brother in holding that there was no ﬂaw in making over the case of the petitioner for trial to the SpecialJudge under section 5 (b) of the Regulation. The Special Judge took cognizance of the case before the Constitutioncame into force, but the entire evidence of the prosecution, unlike Qasim Razvi's case, was recorded after the 26thof January, 1950. The Regulation in question was challenged before us as being void under article 14 read witharticle 13(1) of the Constitution on the following grounds:- (1) [ 1953] S.C.R. 589. (2) [ 1933] S.C.R. 589.676 (1) that the Regulation excludes the committal proceedings, (2) that the procedure of the sessions trial isreplaced by the warrant procedure, (3) that there is no right of transfer, (4) that there is no revision, (5) that theright of conﬁrmation by the Nizam in case of sentences of death has been negatived.As regards the ﬁrst two grounds, Mr. Justice Mukherjea, following the view taken in Qasim Razvi's case(1) has heldthat under section 267A 'of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code committal proceedings are not compulsoryand that there is no substantial diﬀerence , between the sessions trial and the warrant procedure which wasfollowed in the petitioner's case. These two grounds of attack there. fore disappear. So far as grounds Nos. (3) and(4) are concerned, I agree with Mr. Justice Mukherjea in his interpretation of section 8 of the Regulation and hold inconcurrence with the view taken by him that the right to apply for transfer has not been taken away and that theright of revision has been denied only in so far as non- appealable sentences are concerned. The present is a caseof murder and other serious oﬀences which are undoubtedly all appealable.The only discriminatory feature of the Regulation left therefore is that no sentence of a Special Tribunal shall besubject to or submitted for conﬁrmation by any authority whatsoever contained in section 7 (2) of Regulation V of1358F which is made applicable,under section 8 of Regulation X of 1359 F., in other words, that the right of theNizam to conﬁrm the death sentence has been taken away. This is un- questionably a valuable right available tothe accused who is sentenced to death by the Sessions Judge or the High Court as the case may be. We were toldby Mr. Peerbhoy, counsel for the petitioner, that no death sentence passed by the' courts in Hyderabad during thelast 50 years or go has ever been carried into eﬀect and that the Nizam has always exercised (1) [ 1953] S.C.R. 589,677 this right in favour of commuting the death sentence to.a sentence for life. The denial of this right in theRegulation is discriminatory on the face of it and deprives the petitioner of a valuable right. I concede, however,that this objectionable feature of the Regulation is severable from the other parts. I further agree that the stage forthe exercise of that right has not yet arisen, for the appeal of the petitioner is still pending in this court.If the appeal is allowed, or the sentence is reduced, no question of the conﬁrmation of the death sentence by theNizam will arise. If, however, the appeal is dismissed, it will be open to the petitioner to claim this right. It wouldnot be desirable at this stage to express an opinion whether this right is a substantive right which vests in thepetitioner or one relating to a more matter of procedure, as that question will have to be considered and decidedwhen the appropriate stage arrives.I would, therefore, agree in dismissing the petition.Petition dismissed.Agent for the petitioner: Bajinder Narain.Agent for the respondent"

Each of the appellantswas awarded three months' rigorous imprisonment on the charge under section 297 and each of them wassentenced to a ﬁne of Rs.100 on the charge under section 500.The appellants went up in appeal to the Sessions Judge of Howrah who by his order dated 31st July, 1,950, setaside the convictions and sentences and acquitted them. He held that on the facts stated in the complaint the onlyoﬀence that could be said to have been committed by the appellants was one under section 182 or section 21 1,Indian Penal Code, and that a court was not competent to take cognizance of those oﬀences except on a complaintby a proper authority under the provisions of section 195, Criminal Procedure Code. Against the acquittal order anapplication in revision was preferred to the High Court. This petition came up for hearing before a Bench of theHigh Court (K. C.Das Gupta and P. N. Mookerjee JJ.). The learned judges reached the conclusion that on the facts alleged in thepetition of complaint distinct oﬀences under sections 182, 297 and 500, Indian Penal Code, had been disclosed.They however referred for the decision of the Full Bench the following question:- ""If the facts alleged in a petitionof complaint, or in an information received by the magistrate, on which a magistrate can ordinarily takecognizance of an oﬀence under section 190, Criminal Procedure Code, disclose an oﬀence of which cognizancecannot be taken by the magistrate because of the special provisions of section 195, or 196, or 196-A, or 197, or 199,Criminal Procedure Code, is the magistrate also debarred because of this from taking cognizance of other oﬀencesdisclosed by the facts alleged, which are not in any way aﬀected by the provisions of section 195, or 1.96, or 196-Aor 197 or 199, Criminal Procedure Code."" The Full Bench answered the question referred in the negative. In respectof the conviction under 841 section 297, Indian Penal Code, the learned Judges said that there as nothing insections 195 to 199, Criminal Procedure Code, which could in any way bar the prosecution of the appellants underthat section, as it could in no way be said that it arose out of the facts which would constitute an oﬀence undersection 182, or section 211, Indian Penal Code. On the other hand, it arose from an entirely diﬀerent set of facts,namely, the trespass by the opposite parties in the burial ground and the removal of the corpse from the lightedfuneral pyre. With regard to the oﬀence under section 500, it was observed that though the prosecution fordefamation was based on the false information given to a public oﬃcer, that circumstance, however, was no barfor the prosecution of the appellants under that section. In the result the application in revision was allowed, theorder of acquittal was set aside and the sessions judge was directed to re-hear the appeal on the merits.After remand the appeal was heard on the merits and was dismissed. The convictions and sentences passed by themagistrate were conﬁrmed. Against the order of the sessions judge the appellants went up in revision to the HighCourt but these applications were summarily dismissed.The appellants thereupon applied to the High Court for a certiﬁcate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution forleave to appeal to this Court. In the application the order of the Full Bench dated 22nd June, 1951, was challenged.This application was opposed on behalf of the complainant on the ground that the interim order of the Pull Benchnot having, been appealed against could not be challenged at that stage. Thus two substantial questions wereargued in the leave application, namely, 1.whether it was open to the accused to question the correctness of theFull Bench decision, it not having been appealed from when it was passed, and, 2.whether the point decided by theFull Bench in itself was of suﬃcient importance to justify the granting of a certiﬁcate under article 134(1)(c).109 842 As the judgment of the Full Bench did not terminate the proceedings but merely directed the appeal to bereheard, it was held that the petitioners could not appeal from it at that time and it was open to them to raise thepoint at this stage. The second question was considered of suﬃcient importance to justify the grant of leave andleave was accordingly granted.The learned counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary objection in order to canvass the ﬁrst questionmentioned above, while the learned counsel for the appellants canvassed the question of the correctness of thedecision of the Full Bench on its merits. He contended that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to take cognizanceof the complaint under section 500 and section 297, Indian Penal Code, as the facts disclosed constituted anoﬀence under section 182 which oﬀence could not be tried except on a complaint by a public servant.iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/IC/13/2/IURHTTESN95NS95995C3i95www.liiaaseNS959.html36 9/12/ 2020BASR-UL-HQ & OS V. TE SAE OF WT BEGA L [13] IC 29; AIR 13 SC 23; 13 SR 86 (10 Aprl 13)Section 195, Criminal Procedure Code, on which the question raised is grounded, provides, inter alia, that no courtshall take cognizance of an oﬀence punishable under sections 172 to 188, Indian Penal Code, except on thecomplaint in writing of the public servant concerned, or some other public servant to whom he is subordinate. Thestatute thus requires that without a complaint in writing of the public servant concerned no prosecution for an of-fence under section 182 can be taken cognizance of. It does not further provide that if in the course of thecommission of that oﬀence other distinct oﬀences are committed, the magistrate is debarred from takingcognizance in respect of those oﬀences as well. The allegations made in a complaint may have a double aspect,that is, on the one hand these may constitute an oﬀence against the authority of the public servant or publicjustice, and on the other hand, they may also constitute the oﬀence of defamation or some other distinct oﬀence.The section does not per se bar the cognizance by the magistrate of that oﬀence, even if no action is taken by thepublic servant to whom the false report has been made. It was however argued that if on the same facts an 843oﬀence of which no cognizance can be taken under the provisions of section 195 is disclosed and the same factsdisclose another oﬀence as well which is outside the purview of the section and prosecution for that other oﬀenceis taken cognizance of without the requirements of section 195 having been fulﬁlled, then the provisions of thatsection would become nugatory and if such a course was permitted those provisions will stand defeated. It wasfurther said that it is not permissible for the prosecution to ignore the provisions of this section by describing theoﬀence as being punishable under some other section of the Penal Code.In our judgment, the contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellants is without any substance so far asthe present case is concerned. The charge for the oﬀence under section 297, Indian Penal Code, could in nocircumstance, as pointed out by the High Court, be described as falling within the purview of section 195, CriminalProcedure Code. The act of trespass was alleged to have been committed subsequent to the making of the falsereport and all the ingredients of the oﬀence that have been held to have been established on the evidence concernthe conduct of the appellants during the post-report period. In these circumstances, no serious contention couldbe raised that the provisions of section 195 would stand defeated by the magistrate having taken cognizance ofthe oﬀence under that section.As regards the charge under section 500, Indian Penal Code, it seems fairly clear both on principle and authoritythat where the allegations made in a false report disclose two distinct oﬀences, one against the public servant andthe other against a private individual, that other is not debarred by the provisions of section 195 from seekingredress for the oﬀence committed against him. Section 499, Indian Penal Code, which mentions the ingredients ofthe oﬀence of defamation gives within deﬁned limits immunity to persons making depositions in court, but it isnow well settled that immunity is a qualiﬁed one and is not absolute as it is in English law. Under section 198, 844Criminal Procedure Code, a complaint in respect of an oﬀence under section 499, Indian Penal Code, can only beinitiated at the instance of the person defamed, in like manner as cognizance for an oﬀence under section 182cannot be taken except at the complaint of the public -servant concerned. In view of these provisions there doesnot seem in principle any warrant for the proposition that a complaint under section 499 in such a situation cannotbe taken cognizance of unless two persons join in making it, i.e., it can only be considered if both the publicservant and the person defamed join in making it, otherwise the person defamed is without any redress. Thestatute has prescribed distinct procedure for the making of the complaints under these two provisions of theIndian Penal Code and when the prescribed procedure has been followed, the court is bound to take cognizance ofthe oﬀence complained of The decided cases fully support this view and our attention has not been drawn to anycase which has taken a contrary view as regards oﬀences under section 500, Indian Penal Code. In Satish ChandraChakravarti v. Ram Dayal De (1), ﬁve judges of the Calcutta High Court considered this question and held thatwhere the maker of a single statement is guilty of two distinct oﬀences, one under section 21 1, Indian Penal Code,which is an oﬀence against public justice, and the other an oﬀence under section 499, wherein the personalelement largely predominates, the oﬀence under the latter section can be taken cognizance of without thesanction of the court concerned, as the Criminal Procedure Code has not provided for sanction of court for takingcognizance of that oﬀence. It was said that the two oﬀences being fundamentally distinct in nature, could beseparately taken cognizance of. That they are distinct in character is patent from the fact that the former is madenon-compoundable, while the latter remains compoundable; in one for the the initiation of the proceedings thelegislature requires the sanction of the court under section 195, (1) (1920) 24 C.W.N. 982.845 Criminal Procedure Code, while in the other, Cognizance can be taken of the oﬀence on the complaint of theperson defamed. It could not be denied that the accused could be tried of charges under sections 182 and 500,Indian Penal Code, separately on the same facts provided the public servant as well as the person defamed madecomplaints. If that is so, there is no reason why one cannot be tried independently of the other so long as therequirements of each are satisﬁed. Harries C.

TE SAE OF WT BEGA L [13] IC 29; AIR 13 SC 23; 13 SR 86 (10 Aprl 13)the earlier cases of the Calcutta High Court and observed that where upon the facts the commission of severaloﬀences is disclosed some of which require sanction and others do not, it is open to the complainant to proceed inrespect of those only which do not require sanction; because to hold otherwise would amount to legislating andadding very materially to the provisions of section-is 195 to 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Sections 195 to 199 deal with the requisites for the prosecution of certain speciﬁed oﬀences and the provisions ofthose sections must be limited to prosecutions for the oﬀences actually indicated. If it was the intention of thelegislature to make sanctions or complaints in a certain form necessary for the prosecution of all oﬀences disclosedby facts which would give rise to any of the oﬀences speciﬁcally indicated in these sections, the legislature couldhave said so but it did not.Recently this matter was canvassed before a Full Bench of the Madras High Court and it was held that in suchcases it was open to the party defamed to take proceedings under section 499, Indian Penal Code, without thecourt ﬁling a complaint in accordance with the provisions laid down in section 195. There the question waswhether the alleged defamer who had given false evidence in a court could be prosecuted under section 499,Indian Penal Code, without a complaint by the court before whom ﬁe gave evidenice and the question wasanswered in the aﬃrmative after an exhaustive review of the decided cases of the diﬀerent High Courts in India. Itwas said that if the oﬀence of 846 giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding and defamation do not belong tothe same genus but are distinct and separate in their characteryistics and ingredients, it was diﬃcult to perceiveany serious inhibition by the Criminal Procedure Code for initiation and trial of one of these oﬀencesindependently of anterior resort to fulﬁllinig the conditions necessary to comnience a prosecution for the other.These observations have apt application to the present case. The ingredients of the oﬀence under section 182cannot be said to be the ingredients for the oﬀence under section 500. Nor can it be said that the oﬀence relatingto giving false information relates to the same group of oﬀences as that of defamation.Though, in our judgment, section 195 does not bar the trial of an accused person for a distinct oﬀence disclosed bythe same facts and which is not included within the ambit of that section, it has also to be borne in mind that theprovisions of that section cannot be evaded by resorting to devices or camouﬂages. The test whether there isevasion of the section or not is whether the facts disclose primarily and essentially an oﬀence for which acomplaint of the court or of the public servant is required. In other words, the provisions of the section cannot beevaded by the device of charging a person with ail oﬀence to which that section does not apply and thenconvicting him of an oﬀence to which it does, upon the ground that such latter oﬀence is a minor oﬀence of thesame character, or by describing the oﬀence as being one punishable under some other section of the Indian penalCode,, though in truth and substance the oﬀence falls in the category of sections mentioned in section 195,Criminal Procedure Code. Merely by changing the garb or label of an oﬀence which is essentially all oﬀencecovered by the provisions of section 195 prosecution for such an oﬀence cannot be taken cognizance of by mis-describing it or by putting a wrong label on it.Before concluding, reference nay also be made to the decision of the Federal Court in Hori Ram Singh v. TheCrown(1). The appellant in that case was charged (1) [ 1939] F.C.R. 159.847 with oﬀences under sections 409 and 477-A, Indian Penal Code. The oﬀence under section 477-A could not betaken cognizance of without the previous consent of the Governor under section 270(1) of the Constitution Act,while the consent of the Governor was not required for the institution of the proceedings under section 409, IndianPenal Code.The charge was that the accused dishonestly misappropriated or converted to his own certain medicines entrustedto him in his oﬃcial capacity as a sub-assistant surgeon in the Punjab Provincial Subordinate Medical Service. Hewas further charged that being a public servant, be wilfully and with intent to defraud omitted to record certainentries in a stock book of medicines belonging to the hospital where he was employed and in his possession. Theproceedings under section 477-A were quashed by the Federal Court for want of jurisdiction, the consent of theGovernor not having been obtained, but the case was sent back to the sessions judge for hearing oil the merits asregards the charge under section 409, Indian Penal Code, and the order of acquittal passed by the sessions judgeunder that charge was set aside. Two distinct oﬀences having been committed in the same transaction, one anoﬀence of misappropriation under section 409 and the other an oﬀence under section 477-A which required thesanction of the Governor, the cir- cumstance that cognizance could not be taken of the latter oﬀence without suchconsent was not considered a bar to the trial of the appellant with respect to the oﬀence under section 409.iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/IC/13/2/IURHTTESN95NS95995C3i95www.liiaaseNS959.html56 9/12/ 2020BASR-UL-HQ & OS V.

This point, in our opinion, is notopen at this stage, it having been hold that all the ingredients of the oﬀence had been established on the record.Even otherwise there is no substance in the contention because the prosecution evidence is suﬃcient to hold theoﬀence proved against all the appellants.For the reasons given above we hold that there is no substance in these appeals and they are accordinglydismissed.Appeals dismissed.Agent for the appellants: Sukumar Ghose.Agent for the respondent: P.

At the moment of her deathDhirendra Nath was not present at the house. On his return at, about 8-30 p.m. he along with some other personstook the dead body to the cremation ground. It appears that Nurul Huda, the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 27of, 1952, had lodged information at the police station to the eﬀect that Dhirendra Nath had beaten and throttledhis mother to death.When the funeral pyre was in ﬂames, Nurul Ruda along with the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 26 of 1952 andaccompanied by the sub-inspector of police arrived at the cremation ground. The appellants pointed out the deadbody and told the sub-inspector that the complainant had killed his mother by throttling her and that there weremarks of injury on the body which they could show to the sub- Inspector if he caused the body to be brought downfrom the pyre. At their suggestion the ﬁre was extinguished and the dead body was taken down from the pyre inspite of the protests from the complainant. On an examination of the dead body it was found that there were nomarks of injury on. it and the appellants were unable to point out any such marks. The body was however sent forpostmortem examination which was held on 5th September, 1949, but no injury was found on the person of thedeceased. The sub-inspector after investigation reached the conclusion that a false complaint had been madeagainst Dhirendra Nath.On the 24th September, 1949, Dhirendra Nath ﬁled a petition of complaint in the Court of the Sub-DivisionalOﬃcer of Uluberia in the district of Howrali against the appellants in both the cases and one Sanwaral Huq. It wasalleged in the complaint that the information given by Nurul Huda to the police was false, that Nurul Huda and theother appellants had made imputations mala ﬁde out of enmity against him with the intention of harming hisreputation and that to wound his religious feelings they had trespassed on 839 the cremation ground and causedthe dead body to be taken out by making false imputations.The appellants were tried before Shri R. Ray Choudhury, Magistrate 1st class, Uluberia, on charges under sections297 and 500, Indian Penal Code. The charges fraimed against them were in these terms"

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHA DAS J.-On the 28th of January, 1948,the appellant, Khumba Mawji, entered into an agreement with the respondent, the Dominion of India (as it thenwas) to manufacture and supply, to the Bengal Assam Railway, stone boulders and ballast from Chutiapara quarry.The agreement was entered into at Calcutta, though the work was to be carried out in Assam. It was a term of theagreement that if any diﬀerences arose between the parties, they were to be referred to the arbitration of twopersons, one to be nominated by each side, and that if the arbitrators were not able to agree, the matter was to bedecided by an umpire to be nominated by both the arbitrators. Diﬀerences having, in fact, arisen, the dispute wasreferred to two arbitrators and on their disagreement the matter went up to an umpire, one Mr. P. C. Chowdhury.The umpire made two awards on or about the 20th of July, 1949, in favour of the appellant.By one of them he directed a sum of Rs. 3,67,000 to be paid by the respondent to the 880 appellant on or beforethe 19th of August, 1949, with interest thereafter at 6 per cent per annum in case of default. By the other hedirected a sum of Rs. 83,000 to be similarly paid by the respondent to the appellant. He is said to have made overeach of the two awards, in original, to each of the parties. On the 10th of August, 1949, the respondent ﬁled anapplication under section 14, sub- section (2), of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, before the court of theSubordinate Judge of Gauhati in Assam praying that the umpire, Mr. Chowdhury, might be directed to ﬁle both theawards in court so that the petitioner might get an opportunity for ﬁling objections thereto. On this applicationnotice was issued to the umpire to ﬁle the awards into that court before the 24th of August 1949. The umpire senta letter dated 18th August, 1949, to the Subordinate Judge, which is as follows with copies of the awards:- ""DearSir, With reference to your notice in money suit No. 63 of 1949 requiring me to submit the awards made by me inthe above mentioned dispute on 20th July, 1949, I beg to submit that the two awards were made and signed by mein -the presence of the parties and handed over to me on 20th July, 1949. As directed by you I am sending herewithcopies of the same signed by me. On the back of each of these copies occurs the receipt of the parties to theawards."" On receipt thereof, the Subordinate Judge made an order on 24th August, 1949, in the following terms-""Notice on the umpire served. Seen his report forwarding copies of the award of which the originals are said tohave been made over to the parties. Applicant to ﬁle his copy on 3rd September, 1949"".On the 3rd of September, 1949, the respondent ﬁled the awards which were handed over to it by the umpire, andthe matter was being proceeded with by issue of further notices and ﬁling of objections in the court of theSubordinate Judge, Gauhati.881 Meanwhile on the 17th of August 1949, i.e., a week after the respondent made its ﬁrst application in theGauhati court, the appellant's solicitors, Messrs. Mukherjee and Biswas, sent a letter to the Registrar of the HighCourt, Original Side, as follows:"" On behalf of our client Mr. Kumbha Mowjee we beg to enclose herewith two original Awards duly stamped andboth dated, 20th July, 1949, for the respective sums of Rs.3,67,000 and Rs. 83,000 duly signed by the Umpire Mr. P.

Notices were thereupon issued toboth the parties in the following terms:""To 1. Kumbha Mawji.2. The Dominion of India represented by the Assam Railway.Take notice that the Award of the Umpire appointed in the matter of the above Arbitration Agreement hadbeen,ﬁled on the 29th day of August, 1949, and that the Court hearing the commercial causes will proceed topronounce judgment on such award on 7th day of November, 1949.Dated the 29th day of August, 1949."" This notice was served on the respondent on the 2nd of September, 1949.Thus in respect of these awards, proceedings were initiated purporting to be under section 14 (2) of the IndianArbitration Act simultaneously both in the court of the Subordinate Judge 114 882 of Gauhati in Assam as well ason the Original Side of the High Court at Calcutta.The appellant in answer to the notice issued by the Gauhati court on 3rd September, 1949, appeared before thatcourt on 28th October, 1949, and obtained adjournments from time to time until 10th December, 1949. On thatdate the Gauhati court rejected his prayer for any further adjournment and ﬁxed 20th January,' 1950, for an exparte hearing.Meanwhile, the respondent after receiving the notice issued to him by the Calcutta High Court ﬁled, on the 24th ofNovember, 1949, an aﬃdavit dated the 15th of November, 1949, stating his objections to the jurisdiction of theCalcutta Court and to the validity of the awards. On the same date a counter aﬃdavit thereto dated the 19th ofNovember, 1949, was ﬁled on behalf of the appellant. On these aﬃdavits the matter was taken up forconsideration by the Commercial Judge of the Calcutta High Court on the 16th of -December, 1949. The learnedJudge overruled the objections of the respondent, and passed judgment on the two awards. On appeal therefromby the respondent to the Division Bench, the learned Judges reversed the judgment of the single Judge. They heldthat there had been no proper application under section 14(2) of the Indian Arbitration Act, before the High Courtof Calcutta, and that consequently that Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter.Before the learned single Judge of the High Court the main objection taken and set out in paragraph 14 of therespondent's aﬃdavit dated the 15th of November 1949 was as follows:"" I submit further that inasmuch as the application of the Dominion of India under section 14 (2) of the IndianArbitration Act was made as aforesaid to the said Court at Gauhati before the award was ﬁled in this Hon'ble Courtby Kumbha Mawji, the Court at Gauhati alone has jurisdiction."" Under section 31 (1) of the Indian Arbitration Actan award may woe ﬁled in any court having jurisdiction in the matter to which the reference relates. The 883reference in this case arose out of a contract which, as already stated, was entered into at Calcutta and had to beperformed in Assam. Thus the Gauhati court as well as the Calcutta High Court admittedly had jurisdiction overthe subject-matter of the reference. The point taken, however, on behalf of the respondent in their objections wasthat, having regard to section 31, sub-section (4) of the Act and to the fact that an application under section 14,sub- section (2) for a direction to the umpire to ﬁle the award was made to the Gauhati court as early as the 10thAugust, that court was seized of the matter from that date, and that therefore any application under section 14OD a later date to another court, though otherwise competent, was barred under section 31, sub-section (4). Thiswas the main question that was seriously pressed before the learned single Judge. But the learned Judge was ofthe opinion that section 31 (4) related only to applications made during the pendency of a reference to arbitrationand not to applications made subsequent to the making of an award. He thought that in respect of applications forﬁling an award the exclusive jurisdiction was determined with reference to the question as to which was thecompetent court in which the award was, in fact, ﬁrst ﬁled under section 14, sub- section (2) (as distinct from whenthe application for the ﬁling of the award was ﬁrst presented). In this view, the learned Judge held on the facts thatthe award must be taken to have been ﬁled earlier in the Calcutta court and not in the Gauhati court. Heaccordingly held that the Calcutta High Court had exclusive jurisdiction having regard to section 31 (3), and henceproceeded to judgement on the award, the respondent not having ﬁled any objections before him in time.On appeal, the learned Judges considered it unnecessary for them to dispose of the case on either of the abovegrounds considered by the single Judge, and held that on the facts it was quite clear that there had been no dueﬁling of the award at all in the Calcutta court under section 14 (2) inasmuch as the awards 884 which were claimedto have been duly ﬁled were, in fact,not ﬁled by the umpire; nor was it shown that they were ﬁled under hisiofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/13/3/95951957i95www.liiaase954.html37 9/12/ 2020KUMBHA MAWJI V. UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 34; AIR 13 SC 33; 13 S CR 88 (16 Aprl 13)authority. On this limited ground they reversed the decision of the learned single Judge and vacated the judgmentgiven in favour of the appellant on the basis of the two awards. Hence these two appeals to us.On the, facts stated above three questions arise for consideration:(1) Whether the appellant had the authority of the umpire to ﬁle the awards on his behalf into court in terms ofsection 14 (2) of the Arbitration Act ;(2) Whether in view of subsection (3) of section 31 of the Act it can be said that the awards were ﬁled in theCalcutta High Court earlier than in the Gauhati court; and (3) Whether the scope of section 31, sub-section (4) ofthe Act is limited to applications under the Act during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings only.As regards the ﬁrst question, section 14, sub-section (2) provides that, "" the arbitrators or umpire shall, at therequest of any party to the arbitration agreement or any person claiming under such party or if so directed by thecourt and upon payment of the fees and charges due in respect of the arbitration and award and of the costs andcharges of ﬁling the award cause the award or a signed copy of it, together with any depositions or documentswhich may have been taken and proved before them, to be,ﬁled in court, and the court shall thereupon give noticeto the parties of the ﬁling of the award."" This section clearly implies that where the award or a signed copy thereofis in fact ﬁled into court by a party he should have the authority of the umpire for doing so.This is, at any rate, the assumption on which the question has been dealt with in the High Court, and it has notbeen contended before us that the ﬁling of the award into court by a party himself 885 though without theauthority of the umpire to do so on his behalf, is suﬃcient compliance with the terms of this section. The learnedJudges of the High Court were of the opinion that the authority of the umpire empowering the appellant to ﬁle theoriginal awards into Court on his behalf has not been made out on the evidence in the case.The argument stressed before us is that in para 7 of the aﬃdavit dated the 19th of November, 1949, ﬁled on behalfof the appellant in the High Court on the 24th of November, 1949, it is stated that "" On or about the 21st July,1949, the said Umpire made over the said original award to this deponent for ﬁling."" It is urged that this is anaverment of the requisite authority from the umpire, and it is point- ed out that this assertion has not beencontradicted on the other side by any reply aﬃdavit. It is contended therefore that the ﬁling was valid. The learnedJudges in coming to the contrary conclusion relied on two facts, namely, that the umpire in his letter to theGauhati court dated 18th August, 1949, when sending copies of the awards in compliance with the notice issued tohim by that court merely stated that he handed over the awards to both the parties, but did not say that heauthorised any of them to ﬁle the same into court on his behalf. The learned Judges were also of the opinion thatthe umpire as a person of commonsense could not be supposed to have authorised both the parties to ﬁle theawards into Court on his behalf. We are inclined to agree with this reasoning. Where, as in this case, the originalsare said to have been handed over to both the parties, it cannot be assumed that the mere handing over of theawards to the parties necessarily im- plies the authority of the umpire to ﬁle the same into court on his behalf. Thatauthority has to be speciﬁcally alleged and proved. In the present case the statement in the aﬃdavit relied on bylearned counsel before us is no more than ail assertion that the umpire handed over the original awards to theappellant for ﬁling, but there is no allegation that they were so handed over to him for ﬁling on behalf of theumpire.886 The umpire may not have been aware that the awards should be ﬁled into court only by himself or under hisauthority.Learned counsel for the appellant urged that the question of the authorisation of the umpire for the ﬁling of theaward by the appellant was one that was not raised at all as an objection before the learned single Judge of theHigh Court, and that such an objection should not have been taken notice of for the ﬁrst time on appeal. It is nodoubt true that neither the aﬃdavit ﬁled on behalf of the respondent nor the judgment of the learned single Judgegives any indica- tion of this question having been raised in the ﬁrst court,. Indeed, the learned Judges on appealrecognise it when they say towards the concluding portion of their judgment as follows:"" It does not appear that the point on which the appeal succeeds was argued in the court below. But it is a point oflaw and no objection was taken before us by the respondent to the appellant taking the point before us "".Though it is somewhat diﬃcult to see how the question raised can be said to be a pure question of law, it is quiteclear from the above extract that no objection was taken by the respondent to the point being raised. It has notbeen suggested before us that this statement in the judgment was in any way erroneous. Appellant's counseliofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/13/3/95951957i95www.liiaase954.html47 9/12/ 2020KUMBHA MAWJI V. UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 34; AIR 13 SC 33; 13 S CR 88 (16 Aprl 13)argued that if the learned Judges on appeal felt inclined to dispose of the case on this point alone, they shouldhave called upon the umpire to clarify whether or not the appellant had his authority, or given an opportunity forproduction of his aﬃdavit in support of the authority. Learned counsel presses that an. opportunity should now beallowed. It does not appear, however that it is either necessary or desirable at this stage and after this lapse of timeto allow this matter to go back for that purpose. Because, apart from the question of mere want of proof ofauthority, it is clear that in a case of this kind and on the facts above stated, it was 887 incumbent on the appellantto allege categorically that, in terms of sub-section (2) of section 4, he had the requisite authority of the umpire.That allegation is wanting not only -in the aﬃdavit dated the 19th of November, 1949, but what is more importantis that when the awards were ﬁled into court on the 17th of August, 1949, by the solicitors on behalf of theappellant with a letter which might be treated as the initial application to the court, there is not a word to suggestthat the awards were being ﬁled under the authority of the umpire. The letter contained only a bald statementthat the two original awards duly signed by the umpire were enclosed therewith for ﬁling, with a request to directthe oﬃce to ﬁle the two awards and to issue notices in respect thereof expeditiously. In those circumstances, therehas been clearly no suﬃcient compliance with the terms of section 14, sub-section (2) of the Act to constitute theﬁling of the awards by the appellant's solicitors the ﬁling thereof by the umpire.As regards the second question, namely, as to whether with reference to the terms of section 31, subsection (3) theawards should be held to have been ﬁled earlier in the Calcutta court -or in the Gauhati court, the view taken bythe learned Commercial Judge was that the ﬁling in the Calcutta court must be taken to have been earlier. For thepurpose of the consideration of this question it may be assumed that ﬁling was under the authority of the umpire.The learned Judge was of the opinion that the ﬁling of the awards in the Gauhati court must be taken to have beenmade on the 3rd September when in pursuance of the prior order of the Subordinate Judge dated 24th August,1949, the present respondent ﬁled into court the original awards with him.In coming to this conclusion the learned Judge ignored the fact that on 18th August, 1949, the umpire in responseto the notice previously issued to him forwarded to the court signed copies of the awards and that the same werein that court on or before 24th August, 1949. This seems, in terms, to 888 be suﬃcient compliance with theprovisions- of section 14, sub-section (2) which only requires that on the directions of the court the original awardor the copy thereof should be caused by the umpire to be ﬁled into it. The learned Judge stated that he was notaware whether the copies sent to the Subordinate Judge were signed copies or not. The learned Judge failedunfortunately to notice that the umpire himself in his letter dated 18th August, 1949, stated clearly as follows:""As directed by you I am sending herewith copies of the same (awards) signed by me"".The learned Judge was also inclined to think that the mere forwarding of the awards does not amount to the ﬁlingof them. Here again, the learned Judge has overlooked that under section 14, sub-section (2) the actual ﬁling bythe umpire is not essential, but that it is suﬃcient if the umpire causes the awards to be ﬁled. It is not suggestedthat sending by post in compliance with the notice is not such ""causing"".It appears to us therefore clear that the ﬁling of the awards in the Gauhati court must be taken to be on the 24th ofAugust, 1949. So far as the Calcutta court is concerned, though no doubt the awards were, put into that court bythe appellant's solicitors on the 17th August, 1949, it appears clearly from the notice issued by the Registrar datedthe 30th of August, 1949, that the awards were treated as ﬁled only on the 29th day of August, 1949. Paragraphs 8and 9 of the respondent's aﬃdavit ﬁled in the Calcutta court on 24th of November, 1949, contain categoricalassertions that so far as the Gauhati court is concerned, the copies of the awards were ﬁled by the umpire on the24th of August, 1949, while as regards the Calcutta High Court the awards were ﬁled on the 29th of August, 1949.These assertions have not been contradicted on behalf of the appellant in the counter-aﬃdavit ﬁled on the sameday. From these facts, it is clear that the earlier ﬁling for the purposes of section 31(3) is in the Gauhati court andnot in the Calcutta court as held by the learned single Judge under an erroneous impression as to the facts. Wemay as well mention At this stage that 889 it was not suggested before us that for legal purposes the ﬁling of theawards in the Calcutta High Court (on the assumption of existence of authority in the appellant for such ﬁling onbehalf of the umpire) is not the 29th of August, 1949, but only the 10th of August when the letter was sent by thesolicitors to the Registrar enclosing the awards. We mention this because it appears from the judgment of theDivision Bench of the Calcutta High Court that some such point was raised there, but before us the contrary wasassumed. We are accordingly of the opinion that even if the authority of the umpire for the ﬁling of the award intocourt on his behalf by the appellant is to be taken for granted, it was in the Gauhati court that the awards must betaken to have been ﬁled earlier. On this ground, therefore, we are inclined to hold that the Gauhati court alone hasjurisdiction under section 31 (3) of the Act.iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/13/3/95951957i95www.liiaase954.html57 9/12/ 2020KUMBHA MAWJI V. UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 34; AIR 13 SC 33; 13 S CR 88 (16 Aprl 13)The third question which remains for consideration is whether sub-section (4) of section 31 of the IndianArbitration Act of 1940 applies only where the ﬁrst application under the Act was made during the course ofpendency of a reference to arbitration or also to a case like the present one where such ﬁrst application is madeafter the completion of the arbitration and on the making of an award. As already stated, the learned Judges onappeal did not deal with this question. The trial Judge, however, considered the matter, and held that the aboveprovision related only to an application made during the pendency of a reference to arbitration. In the view of thelearned Judge, "" In order to attract sub-section (4) an application must have been made during the pendency of thereference, and if such an application had been made, all other applications arising out of that reference (whethermade in the reference or not) must be made in that court"".Apparently, the learned Judge construed the phrase ""in a reference "" in section 31, sub-section (4), as meaning ""inthe course of a reference"", and that is also the 115 900 contention before us of the counsel for the appellant, whichrequires closer examination.Section 31 of the Indian Arbitration Act of 1940 is in the following terms:"" (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an award may be ﬁled in any Court having jurisdiction in the matter towhich the reference relates.(2)Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force and save as otherwise providedin this Act, all questions regarding the validity, eﬀect or existence of an award or an arbitration agreementbetween the parties to the agreement or persons claiming under them shall be decided by the Court in which theaward under the agreement has been, or may be, ﬁled, and by no other Court.(3)All applications regarding the conduct of arbitration proceedings or otherwise arising out of such proceedingsshall be made to the Court where the award has been, or may be, ﬁled, and to no other Court.(4)Notwithstanding anything contained elsewherein this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, wherein any reference an application under the Act has been made in a Court competent to entertain it, that Court aloneshall have jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of thatreference and the arbitration proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court"".Sub-section (1) relates to the question as to where a completed award has to be ﬁled, and prescribes the localjurisdiction for that purpose. Sub-section (2) deals with the ambit of the exercise of that jurisdiction, and declaresit to be exclusive by saying that ""all questions regarding the validity, eﬀect or existence of an award or arbitrationagreement between the parties to the agreement or persons claiming under them shall be decided by the Court inwhich the award under the agreement has been, or may be, ﬁled and by no other Court"". Sub-section (3) isintended to provide 891 that all applications regarding the conduct of arbitration proceedings or otherwise arisingout of such proceedings are to be made only in one court, and lays on the concerned party the obligation to do so.Then comes sub-section (4), the object of which apparently is to go further than sub- section (3), that is, notmerely casting on the party concerned an obligation to ﬁle all applications in one court but vesting exclusivejurisdiction for such applications in the court in which the ﬁrst application has been already made.Thus it will be seen on a comprehensive view of section 31 that while the ﬁrst sub-section determines thejurisdiction of the court in which an award can be ﬁled, subsections (2), (3) and (4) are intended to make thatjurisdiction eﬀective in three diﬀerent ways, (1) by vesting in one court the authority to deal with all questionsregarding the validity, eﬀect or existence of an award or an arbitration agreement, (2) by casting on the personsconcerned the obligation to ﬁle all applications regarding the conduct of arbitration proceedings or otherwisearising out of such proceedings in one court, and (3) by vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the court in which the ﬁrstapplication relating to the matter is ﬁled. The context, therefore, of subsection (4) would seem to indicate that thesub-section was not meant to be conﬁned to applications made during the pendency of an arbitration. Thenecessity for clothing a single court with eﬀective and exclusive jurisdiction, and to bring about by the combinedoperation of these three provisions the avoidance of conﬂict and scramble is equally essential whether thequestion arises during the pendency of the arbitration or after the arbitration is completed or before thearbitration is commenced. There is no conceivable reason why the Legislature should have intended to conﬁne theoperation of subsection (4) only to appli- cations made during the pendency of an arbitration, if as is contended,the phrase "" in any reference "" is to be taken as meaning "" in the course of a reference "".iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/13/3/95951957i95www.liiaase954.html67 9/12/ 2020KUMBHA MAWJI V. UNION OF INDIA [13] INSC 34; AIR 13 SC 33; 13 S CR 88 (16 Aprl 13)It may be noticed that the Arbitration Act deals with arbitration of three diﬀerent categories: (1) arbitration 892without intervention of the court, dealt with in sections 3 to 19 comprising Chapter IT; (2) arbitration with theintervention of a court where there is no suit pending provided in section 20 which is a separate Chapter III; and (3)arbitration in suits dealt with in sections 21 to 25 comprising Chapter IV. The jurisdiction as regards the latter twoclasses of arbitrations in respect of certain matters is provided in the very provisions relating to those two classesof arbitrations, that is, section 20, sub- section (1) and section 21. Sub-section (1) of section 31 appears to refer onlyto the ﬁrst class. It may, therefore, have been, plausibly, suggested that sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) refer only tothis class. But no such position was taken up before us. Indeed, having regard to the wide language employed inthese sub-sections it has been assumed that sub-sections (2) and (3) cover all three classes in all their stages. If so,is there any suﬃcient reason to think that sub-section (4) was meant to have a very restricted operation ? On theview of this sub-section suggested for the appellant, not only would an application made after the award waspronounced be excluded from sub- section (4) but also an application made before the commencement of thearbitration, i.e., for the ﬁling of an agreement of reference and for a direction thereupon. It must be rememberedthat section 31 is one of the group of sections headed "" General "" which by virtue of section 26 are applicable to allarbitrations. Unless therefore the wording in sub-section (4) of section 31 is so compelling as to conﬁne the scopethereof to applications during the pendency of an arbitration, such a limited construction must be rejected.As already stated, the entire basis of the limited construction is the meaning of the phrase "" in any reference"" usedin subsection (4) as meaning "" in the course of any reference "". But such a connotation thereof is not in anyordinary sense compelling. The preposition "" in "" is used in various contexts and is capable of conveying variousshades of meaning. In the Oxford English Dictionary one of the shades of meaning of this preposition is 893""Expressing reference or relation to something; in reference or regard to ; in the case of, in the matter, aﬀair, orprovince of.Used especially with the sphere, or department in relation or reference to which an attribute or quality ispredicated"".In the context of section 31, sub-section (4), it is reasonable to think that the phrase ""in any references means "" inthe matter of a reference "". The word ""reference"" having been deﬁned in the Act as ""reference to arbitration"", thephrase ""in a reference"" would mean ""in the matter of a reference to arbitration"". The phrase ""in a reference"" is,therefore, comprehensive enough to cover also an application ﬁrst made after the arbitration is completed and aﬁnal award is made, and in our opinion that is the correct construction thereof in the context. We are, therefore, ofthe opinion that section 31 (4) would vest exclusive jurisdiction in the court in which an application for the, ﬁling ofan award has been ﬁrst made under section 14 of the Act.It is undisputed that the application by the respondent Union of India was made before the Gauhati court on the10th August, 1949, and the earliest move by the appellant before the Calcutta court was on the 17th August, 1949.Oil these facts and on the view of the interpretation of section.31, sub-section (4), which we are inclined to take, itis clear that the Gauhati court only has the jurisdiction and not the Calcutta High Court as regards the presentdispute.In the result, the two appeals must be dismissed with costs.Appeals dismissed.Agent for the appellant: Sukumar Ghose.Agent for the respondent: G.

THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ANR [13] INSC 37; AIR 13 SC 30; 13 S CR 70 ( 17 Ap ril 13)On the 30th December, 1949, a bill entitled the Bihar Land -Reforms Bill was passed by the Bihar Legislature andhaving been reserved for the consideration of the President received his assent on the 11th September, 1950. TheAct so passed and assented to was published in the Bihar Gazette on the 25th September, 1950, and was broughtinto force on the same day by a notiﬁcation made by the State Government in exercise of powers conferred on itby section 1(3) of the Act. Many of the proprietors and tenure holders of Zamindari estates took proceedingsagainst the State of Bihar for appropriate orders restraining the State Government from taking over the estatesunder the provisions of the Act which they claimed to be beyond the legislative competency of the BiharLegislature and otherwise void. On the 12th March, 1951, a Special Bench of the Patna High Court held that theAct was unconstitutional on account of its contravention of article 14 of the Constitution. The State of Biharappealed to this Court. Pending that appeal, the provisional Parliament passed the Constitution (FirstAmendment) Act, 1951. The respondents in the main appeal took proceedings in this Court, contending that theAct amending the Constitution was invalid. This 722 Court however, on 5th October, 1951, upheld the validity ofthe amending Act. On 6th November,' 1951, notiﬁcations were issued under section3 of the Bihar Act declaringthat certain Touzies belonging to the appellants speciﬁed in the notiﬁcation had passed to and become vested inthe State.Both the appellants made separate applications to the Patna High Court under article 226 of the Constitutionpraying for mandamus or suitable direction or order restraining the respondent from taking possession of theirrespective estates or tenures by virtue of the said notiﬁcations and for other ancillary reliefs. The appeals ﬁled bythe State of Bihar against the order of the Special Bench declaring the Act to be void came up for hearing beforethis Court and this Court upheld the validity of the Act, except as to a few provisions mentioned in the majorityjudgment which were hold to be severable. Thereafter, the two applications made by the two appellants underarticle 226 before the Patna High Court came up for hearing and were dismissed by a Bench of that Court on the22nd December, 1952. The present appeals have been ﬁled with leave of the Patna High Court against the saiddismissal.The question raised before the High Court was whether the Act was, on its true construction, intended to apply toZamindari estates of companies incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. In support of the appellants'contention that it was not, it was urged -that the Bihar Legislature had no authority to legislate with respect totrading corporations or non-trading corporations whose objects were not conﬁned, to one State. Reference wasmade to entries 43, 44 and 45 of List I to show that it was Parliament alone which was authorized to make law withrespect to matters set forth in those entries. The contention was that the Bihar Legislature in enacting the Actinvaded the Union ﬁeld and so the Act was invalid. This argument was sought to be reinforced by reference to theprovisions of the Act and the winding up provisions of the Companies Act. The Patna High 723 Court overruled thiscontention and Mr.P.R.Das appearing in support of these appeals has not challenged this part of the decision ofthe Patna High Court.The main point urged by Mr. P. R. Das is that even if the Bihar Legislature could make a law for acquiring Zamindariestates of incorporated companies it did not, by the Act, in fact do so. Section 3 authorises the State Governmentto declare by notiﬁcation that the estates or tenures of a proprietor or tenure-holder have passed to and becomevested in the State. It will be recalled that it was under this section that the State Government on the 6thNovember, 1951, issued the notiﬁcations with respect to the estates of the appellants situate within the State. Mr.P. R. Das's principal contention is that the appellant companies do not come within the terms, "" proprietor"" or ""tenure holder"" as deﬁned by the Act and consequently no part of their estates were intended 'to be vested or did infact vest in the State. "" Proprietor"" is deﬁned by section 2(o) as meaning a person holding in trust or owning for hisown beneﬁt an estate or a part of an state and includes the heirs and successors-in-interest of a proprietor and,where a proprietor is a minor or of unsound mind or an idiot, his guardian, committee or other legal curator.Tenure-holder is deﬁned by section 2 (r) as meaning a person who has acquired from a proprietor or from anytenure-holder a right to hold land etc. The argument is that the word ""person"" in the two deﬁnitions referred toabove does not, in the context of the Act, include a company. It is conceded that under section 4(40) of the BiharGeneral Clauses Act the word ""person"" would ordinarily include a company, but it is urged by Mr. P.R. Das that thedeﬁnitions given in that section apply only where there is nothing repugnant in the subject or context. Hiscontention is that the deﬁnition of ""proprietor"" and ""tenureholder"" indicates that a company which ownsZamindaries is not covered by that deﬁnition.We are unable to accept this contention. It is not disputed 94 724 that a company can own an estate or a part of anestate and, indeed, the appellant companies are ﬁghting these appeals only to protect the estates they own.Therefore, they come within the ﬁrst part of the deﬁnition. The deﬁnition after stating what the word means.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/37.html/0209595295295www9525 9/12/2MOTIPUR ZAMINDARI CO. LTD. V. THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ANR [13] INSC 37; AIR 13 SC 30; 13 S CR 70 ( 17 Ap ril 13)proceeds to state what else the deﬁnition would include under certain speciﬁed circumstances, namely, the heirsand successor-in-interest etc. The word ""heir"" certainly is inappropriate with regard to a company, but there isnothing inappropriate in the company having a successor in interest. It is pointed out that there is no provision inthe deﬁnition of proprietor to include the directors, managing agents and, in case of winding up, the liquidator ofthe company. This circumstance does not appear to us to be a cogent reason for holding that the word ""proprietor""as deﬁned does not cover a company. It is to be noted that the agent or, in case of insolvency, the oﬃcial assigneeor receiver of an individual proprietor are also not included in the deﬁnition. Reference to proprietor who is a minoror of unsound mind or an idiot and his guardian etc., was obviously necessary because those proprietors suﬀerfrom legal disabilities.Mr. P. R. Das refers us to various sections and rules framed under section 43 of the Act to show that' only naturalpersons were intended to be aﬀected by the Act, because, ha urges, the company is not competent to do the actstherein referred to. It is not ,disputed by Mr. P. R.Das that there is no diﬃculty on the part of an incorporated company to do all these acts by its directors ormanaging agents or other oﬃcers empowered in that behalf by its articles of association, but his contention is thatthe provisions of the Indian Companies Act should not be imported into the consideration of the provisions of hisAct. He relies primarily on the case of Pharmaceutical Society v. The London and Provincial Supply Association,Limited(1) whore it was held,that a corporation (1) (1880) L.R. 5 App. Cas. 857.725 did not come within the word ""person"" used in the Pharmacy Act, 1868 (31 & 32 Vic., Chapter 121). Reliancewas placed upon the observations of Lord Selborne L.C. at page 863.The preamble to that Act recited, amongst other things, that it was ""expedient for the safety of the public thatpersons keeping open shop for the retailing, dispensing or compound- ing of poisons, and persons known aschemists and druggists should possess a competent practical knowledge of their business."" This clearlycomtemplated persons skilled in matters pharmaceutical and not impersonal corporate bodies which would knownothing about that particular business.Indeed, Lord Blackburn in his speech in the House of Lords in the Pharmaceutical Society's case(1) referred to thispreamble and observed at page 870:- ""Stopping there, it is quite plain. that those who used that language were notthinking of corporations. A corporation may in one' sense, for all substantial purposes of protecting the public,possess a competent knowledge of its business,, if it employs competent directors, managers, and so forth. But itcannot possibly have a competent knowledge in itself. The metaphysical entity, the legal 'person', the corporation,cannot possibly have a competent knowledge. Nor I think, can a corporation be supposed to be a 'person known asa chemist and druggist'."" His Lordship then referred to the provisions of sections 1 and 15 of that Act and came tothe conclusion that the word ""person"" in that Act. meant a natural person. The eﬀect of 'that case is that whetherthe word ""Person"" in a statute can be treated as including a corporation must depend on a consideraiion of theobject of the statute and of the enactments passed with a view to carry that object into eﬀect. In view of the objectof that Act as recited in the preamble there could be no manner of doubt that the word ""person"" in that Act couldnot possibly, include a corporation. Lord Selborne towards the end of page 863 indicated, by reference to the 18th(1) (188o) L.R. 5 App. Cas. 857 726 section, that the legislature by the word ""person"" referred only to individualpersons as it was clearly repugnant to the subject of that Act to include a corporation within the word ""person"" asused in 'that Act. Mr. P. R. Das urges that the judgment of Lord Selborne was founded on the fact that thecorporation could not come within the term ""person"" on the ground that it could not make an application inwriting signed by it. From this Mr. P. R. Das urges that the necessary implication of this part of the judgment ofLord Selborne is that it was not permissible to take the provisions of the Companies Act into consideration forconstruing another Act. If that were the implication of the speech of Lord Selborne, with respect, we are unable toaccept the same. Indeed, one cannot think of a company unless one has in view the provisions of the CompaniesAct, for a company is the creature of the Companies Act. Its existence, powers and rights are all regulated by thatAct.The trend of the, speeches of the noble Lords in the case relied on by Mr. P. R. Das is that the object of theparticular Act under consideration was entirely repugnant to the word ""corporation"" being included within theterm ""Person"" as used in that Act, and as we apprehend it, that decision lays down nothing beyond that.In support of his contention that a company owning an estate was never intended to be aﬀected by the Act, Mr.P..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/37.html/0209595295295www9535 9/12/2MOTIPUR ZAMINDARI CO. LTD. V. THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ANR [13] INSC 37; AIR 13 SC 30; 13 S CR 70 ( 17 Ap ril 13)R. Das draws our attention to the winding up sections of the Indian Companies Act and urges that it is not possibleto ﬁt in the scheme of winding up into the scheme of the Bihar Act. If the Zamindari assets of the company aretaken over and compensation is paid by non-transferable bonds it will, he contends, be impossible, to apply thelaw of winding up in case the company goes into liquidation. There will, according to him, be conﬂict of jurisdictionbetween the Court where the winding up is proceeding, which may conceivably be in another State, land the BiharGovernment and its oﬃcers. 'We see no force in this contention.Upon a 727 notiﬁcation being issued under section 3, the Zamindari estate will vest in the State and the companywill cease to have any interest in it. Its only right will be to receive compensation. In case of winding up theliquidator will have to pursue the remedy provided by this Act. He or the company will be in no worse position thanthe oﬃcial assignee or oﬃcial receiver of an individual proprietor who may happen to become insolvent in anotherState.Finally, Mr. P. R. Das strongly relies on section 41 of the Act and contends that that section would be whollyinapplicable to a company and that circumstance by itself would indicate that the Bihar Legislature did not intendthat a company owning an estate should be governed by this Act. A corporation, it is true, cannot be made liablefor treason, felony or any misdemeanour involving personal violence or for any oﬀence for which the only penaltyis.imprisonment or corporal punishment. (Halsbury, 2nd Edition, Volume IX, article 5, p. 14). Section 41 does notprescribe punishment by imprisonment only. Mr. P. R. Das suggests that the inﬂiction of imprisonment or ﬁnewould depend upon the gravity of the oﬀence and not on the character of the oﬀender. This argument, however,would seem to run counter to the opinion of Lord Blackburn set forth at pages 869-870 of the report of the verycase relied on by Mr. P.R. Das. The recent cases of Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kent and Sussex Contractors Limited(1) and Rex v.I.C.B.Haulage, Limited and Another(2) seem to indicate that a corporation may be convicted even of an oﬀencerequiring an act of will or a state of mind. Apart, however, from the consideration whether a company may be heldguilty of wilful failure or neglect, as to which we need not express any deﬁnite opinion on this occasion, there canbe no diﬃculty in applying the provisions of section 41 to the oﬃcers or agents of the company. On a notiﬁcationunder section 3(1) being published the estate vests in the State.Section 4 sets out the (1) [ 1944] I.K.B. 14 6. (2) [ 1944] I.K.B. 551.728 consequences of such vesting. Clause (g) of that section empowers the Collector by written order served in theprescribed manner to require any person in possession of.such an estate or tenure or any part thereof to give up possession of the same by a date speciﬁed in the order andto take such steps or use such force as may be necessary for securing compliance with the said order. If any oﬃceror agent of the company in the possession of the estate wilfully fails or ignores to comply with such lawful order,then surely he can be proceeded against under section 41.Likewise, under section 40, the. oﬃcers therein mentioned are authorized at any time before or after the date ofvesting by a written order served in the prescribed manner to require a proprietor or tenureholder or any otherperson in possession of such an estate or tenure or any agents or employees of such proprietor, tenure-holder orother person to produce at a time and place speciﬁed in the order such documents, papers or registers or to furnishsuch informa- tion relating to such estate or tenure as such oﬃcer may from time to time require for any of thepurposes of this Act. A wilful failure or neglect to comply with such order would clearly bring the recalcitrant oﬃceror agent of the company within the penalty provided under section 41.Section 41 therefore, does not necessarily preclude the application of the Act to incorporated companies.It cannot be denied that a company is competent to own and hold property. The whole. object of the impugnedAct is thus stated by Mahajan J. in the State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh(1):"" Now it is obvious that concentration of big blocks of land in the hands of a few individuals is contrary to theprinciple on which the Constitution of India is based. The purpose of the acquisition contemplated by the.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/37.html/0209595295295www9545 9/12/2MOTIPUR ZAMINDARI CO. LTD. V. THE ST A TE OF BIHAR & ANR [13] INSC 37; AIR 13 SC 30; 13 S CR 70 ( 17 Ap ril 13)impugned Act therefore is to do away with the concentration of big blocks of land and means of production in thehands of a few individuals and to so distribute the ownership and control of the (1) [ 1952] S.C. R. 889 at p. 941.729 material resources which come in the hands of the State as to subserve the common good as best as possible.In other words, shortly put, the purpose behind the Act is to bring about a reform in the land distribution system ofBihar for the general beneﬁt of the community as advised."" In view of this, purpose there is no reason todiﬀerentiate between an individual proprietor and a company which owns estates or tenures. Indeed, there is notonly nothing repugnant in the subject or context of the Act which should prevent the inclusion of a companyowning estate within the deﬁnition of ""proprietor"", such inclusion is necessary in order to give full eﬀect to the veryobject of the Act.In Appeal No. 63 of 1953 Mr. P. R. Das raises an additional point, namely, that the appellant company in that appealowns estates which are situate in Purnea in the district of Bihar and in Malda in the district of West Bengal but ithas to pay a single Government revenue at Purnea. It is further alleged that the appellant company has let outportions of the estates on Patni leases, each of the Patnis comprising land situate both within and outside Bihar.The acquisition of that part of the estate, which is situate in Bihar has made it diﬃcult, if not impossible, for theappellant company to pay its revenue or recover its rent. That part of the estate which is in Bihar cannot besevered from the rest and therefore the notiﬁcation covering only the portion of the estate situate in Bihar isinvalid. We do not think there is any substance in this argument. As stated by the High Court it is a simple case ofapportionment of the revenue and also apportionment of the rent. The necessity for such apportionment cannotpossibly aﬀect the validity of the notiﬁcation.For reasons stated above these appeals fail and must be dismissed with costs.Appeals dismissed.Agent for the appellants: B.

TheAppellate Tribunal held that in the absence of any evidence that personal liberty was likely to be jeopardised therewas only a chance of his being ﬁned, that the object of saving himself from ﬁne was so inextricably mixed with themain purpose of the defence which was solely for the purpose of maintaining the respondent's name as a goodbusinessman and also to save his stock from being undersold, that it could be ignored, and that, therefore, theclaim was allowable under s. 10(2)(xv).

H. HE [1953] IC 38; AIR 1953 SC 324; 1953 SR 714 (17 Aprl 1953)We are unable to agree that the ﬁnding of the Tribunal, to which reference has been made, is binding on the Courtas a ﬁnding of fact and is decisive of the reference. The ﬁnding of the Tribunal is vitiated by its refusal to considerthe possibility of the criminal proceeding terminating in the conviction and imprisonment of the respondent. Ashas been stated, the respondent was prosecuted under section 13 which provides: ""Whoever contravenes theprovisions of this Ordinance shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to ﬁve years orwith ﬁne or with both."" The respondent was charged with contravention of section 6, which by sub-sec- tion (1)prohibits the sale by a dealer or producer of an article for a consideration which is unreasonable (1) [ 1950] is I.T.R.557.718 and sub-Section (2) deﬁnes ""unreasonable consideration"".The framers of the Ordinance thus appear to have regarded the oﬀence as one calling for a deterrent punishmentin view of its antisocial character, and it is idle to suggest that it is for the Income-tax authorities to prove in suchcases that the conviction might result in a sentence of imprisonment and that$ in the absence of such proof, therewas, at the most, only a chance of conviction and ﬁne. We cannot appreciate the remark that ""even this chance ofcon- viction and ﬁne was so inextricably mixed up with the main purpose of the defence that it could, be ignored.""A ﬁnding arrived at on this line of reasoning is obviously vitiated by a serious misapprehension regarding the riskinvolved in a prosecution under the Ordinance and it cannot be regarded as binding on the Court in dealing withthe reference. If, as the High Court realised, in every criminal prosecution where the matter is defended to protectthe good name of a business or a professional man, the fear of possible ﬁne or imprisonment must always bethere, it must ordinarily be diﬃcult for any Court to say, that the expenses incurred for the defence, -even if theyare not to be regarded as the ""personal expenses"" of the person accused, constituted ""expenditure laid out orexpended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business"". Learned counsel for the respondent franklyadmitted that he was not able to ﬁnd a single case in the books where the expenses incurred by, a personexercising a trade or profession in defending a criminal prosecution, which arises out of his business or professionalactivities, were allowed to be deducted in the assessment of his proﬁts or gains for income-tax purposes.Reference was made in the course of argument to numerous cases where legal expenses incurred in civil litigation,arising out, of matters incidental to the carrying on of a business, were allowed as, a deduction in the computationof its-proﬁts, e.g.Commissioner of Income-tax v.Maharajadhiraj of Darbhanga(1), where (1) (1942) L.R. 69 I.A. 15.719 the Privy Council held that law charges incurred in defending an action brought against a money-lender fordamages for conspiracy, misrepresentation and breach of contract to advance suﬃcient funds to ﬁnance e acompany were allowable as business expenditure. In that class of case, no question could arise as to the primary orsecondary purpose for which the legal expenses could be said to have been incurred as in the case of a criminalprosecution where the defence cannot easily be dissociated from the purpose of saving the accused person from apossible conviction and imposition of the prescribed penalty. Nor are we satisﬁed, -as at present advised, that adistinction drawn in the Bombay case(1) between the legal expenses of a successful and unsuccessful defence issound. The deductibility of such expenses under, section 10(2) (xv) must depend on the nature and purpose of thelegal proceeding in relation to the business whose proﬁts are under computation, and cannot be aﬀected by theﬁnal outcome of that proceeding.Income-tax assessments have to be-made for every year and cannot be held up until the ﬁnal result of a legalproceeding, which may pass through several courts, is announced.For the reasons indicated we allow the appeal and answer the question referred in the negative.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.-This is an appeal from ajudgment of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta answering a reference under section 66-A of the IndianIncome-tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in favour of the respondent herein.The respondent carries on business as selling agents of the Bengal Potteries Ltd., and he was prosecuted undersection 13 of the Hoarding, and Proﬁteering Ordinance, 1943, (Ordinance No. XXXV of 1943) on a charge of sellinggoods at prices higher than were reasonable in contravention of the provisions of section 6 thereof. It appearsthat, before the prosecution was launched in August, 1944, respondent's business premises were searched and apart of his stock was seized and taken away. The respondent defended the case, spending a sum of Rs. 10,895, andthe prosecution ended in an acquittal on February 16, 1945. In his assessment to income-tax for the year 1945-46,the respondent claimed the deduction of the Said sum of Rs.10,895 from the proﬁts of his business under section 10(2) (xv) of the Act. The Income-tax Oﬃcer 93 716 disallowedthe claim but the Appellate Assistant Com missioner allowed it, and his decision was conﬁrmed by the Income-taxAppellate Tribunal, Calcutta Bench. Thereupon, the Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal, applied to theTribunal to state a case for decision by the High Court under section 66-A of the Act, and the Tribunal accordinglyreferred the following question to that Court for its decision Whether in the circumstances of this case the Tribunalwas right in holding that the sum of Rs. 10,895 spent in defending the criminal,proceeding was an expenditure laidout or expended wholly and exclusively for the 'purpose of business as contemplated by section 10(2) (xv) of theIndian Income-tax Act ? In dismissing the appeal preferred by the Income-tax Oﬃcer, the Tribunal observed:""It may be stated straight oﬀ that it has not been established by any material that the conviction in cases like thismay end in imprisonment. The question that personal liberty was likely to be jeopardised therefore will not beconsidered by us.................. In any case, in the absence of any material in this particular case that personal libertywas likely to be jeopardised, all that we can say is that there was a chance of conviction in which the respondentmight have been ﬁned. No doubt, the element of saving himself from the ﬁne, if any, might be there, but it is soinextricably mixed up with the main purpose for the defence that we are prepared to ignore that little element.In our opinion, the defence was solely for the purpose of maintaining his name as a good businessman and also tosave his stock from being undersold if the Court held that the prices charged by the respondent wereunreasonable."" In the order made on the reference Harries C. J. (with whom Banerjee J. concurred) remarked:""In every criminal prosecution where the matter is defended to protect the good name of a business or -aprofessional man, the fear of possible ﬁne or 717 imprisonment must always be there. But the Tribunal havepointed out that this was so inextricably mixed up with the protection of the good name of the business that it canwell be found that the -money' spent in defence in the criminal prosecution wag spent solely and exclusively forthe purpose of the business. The ﬁnding is a ﬁnding of fact and is binding upon us."" The learned Judges proceededto refer to a ruling of the Bombay High Court J. B. Advani v. Commissioner of Income- tax(1)-and held that therespondent satisﬁed both the tests laid down there as applicable in such cases"

J.-This is an application underarticle 32 of the Constitution seeking protection of the petitioners' fundamental right under article 15 (1) againstalleged violation thereof by the respondents.The petitioners are three residents of Etah in Uttar Pradesh. They complain that at the by election to the MunicipalBoard of Etah held on November 2, 1951, December 8, 1951, and March 17, 1952, at which respondents 4, 11 and12 were respectively elected, the Petitioners were deprived of their rights to exercise their votes and to seek theirelection as candidates, as those by-elections were held on communal lines on the basis of separate electoratescontrary to the provisions of the Constitution. They also allege that the nomination of respondent 3 as a memberof the Board by the Government was an illegal exercise of its powers, as the interest which that respondent wasnominated to represent in the Board was already suﬃciently represented.The petition ners accordingly pray for the issue of writs of quo warranto, mandamus and other appropriate writs ordirections to respondents 3, 4, 11 and 12 to show under what authority they are acting as members of the Boardand to prevent them from acting assuchmembers. Tbe petitioners also ask for wkits on the District Magistrate andthe Civil Judge of Etah, respondents 2 and 13 respectively, directing them not to hold or permit the holding of anymeeting of the Board which is said to be illegally constituted.Now, it cannot be seriously disputed that any law providing for elections on the basis of separate electo- rates formembers of diﬀerent religious communities oﬀends against article 15 (1) of the Constitution which runs thus 1186""15 (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place ofbirth or any of them."" This constitutional mandate to the State not to diis- criminate against any citizen on theground, inter- alia, of religion clearly extends to political as.well as to other rights, and any election held after theConstitution in ,pursuance of such a law subject to clause (4) must be held void as being repugnant to theConstitution. But the question is whether the petitioners are now entitled to the relief they seek in this applicationunder article 32.It is true, as pointed out in the Cross Roads case(1), that article 32 provides, in some respects, for a more eﬀectiveremedy through this court than article 226 does through the High Courts. But the scope of the remedy is clearlynarrower in that it is restricted solely to enforcement of fundamental rights conferred by Part III of theConstitution. Any right, for instance, which the petitioners may have as rate-payers in the Municipality to insistthat the Board should be legally constituted and that respondents 3, 4, 11 and 12, who are not properly elected ornominated members, should not be permitted to take part in the proceedings of the Board, is outside the purviewof article 32, as such right, even if it exists, is not a fundamental right conferred by Part 111.Petitioners' learned counsel, however, contended that the fundamental right conferred by article 15 (1) on thepetitioners as citizens of India was violated by the elections in question having been held on a basis whichdiscriminated against the petitioners on the ground of their religion in that it precluded them from exercising theirfranchise in relation to all the candidates and from contesting the elections without regard to the reservation ofseats on communal basis. Learned counsel,also submitted that the delimitation of the constituencies oncommunal lines was a denial of equality to the petitioners in the matter of their political rights and in that respectalso infringed their (1) [ 1950] INSC 16; [ 1950] S.C.R 594 1187 fundamental right under article 14. We are unable toaccede to these contentions.It is plain that the fundamental right conferred by article 15(1) is conferred on a citizen as an individual and is aguarantee against his being subjected to discrimination in the matter of the rights, privileges and immunitiespertaining to him as a citizen generally. It is not the petitioners' case that any discrimination is now being practisedor threatened against them. Their grievance is that the mode of election by separate electorates formed oncommunal lines involved discrimination against them in relation to seats other than those reserved for theirrespective communities as to which they could not exercise their right to vote or their right to stand as candidates.There is no suggestion that the petitioners actually sought to assert those rights by taking appropriateproceedings to have the bar removed and the election conducted in accordance with the Constitution. In fact, thepetitioners acquiesced in the elections being conducted under the old system of separate electorates and felt nodiscrimination having been practised against them until a no-conﬁdence motion was tabled recently against theformer Chairman who has since lost his seat as a result of that motion having been carried. Thus, the infringementof their fundamental rights under article 15(1) and art 61 14, that is, the discrimination practised against them, ofwhich they now complain, related to rights which they in fact never sought to exercise and took no steps to assert,while there was still room for doing so, and for the exercise of which the opportunity is now lost.

The wholedoctrine of colourable legislation is based upon the maxim that you cannot do indirectly what you cannot dodirectly.2 (ii) The impugned Act was in substance and form a law in respect to the ""taxing of agricultural income"", asdescribed in entry 46 of List 11 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and, as the State Legislature wascompetent to legislate on this subject, the Act was not void, and the fact that the object of the legislature was toaccomplish another purpose, viz., to reduce the compensation payable under the Estates Abolition Act, cannotrender this law a colourable legislation and void as such, as the ulterior object itself was not beyond thecompetence of the legislature.(iii) Assuming that in India there is no absolute rule of law that whatever is aﬃxed to or built on the soil becomes apart of it and is subject to the same rights of property as the soil itself, there is nothing in law which prevents theState Legislature from providing as part of an estate abolition scheme that buildings lying within the ambit of anestate and used primarily for the management or administration of the estate should vest in the Government asappurtenances to the estate itself.

Merely because compensation was based on the produce rentpayable by the tenants it cannot be said that the landholder was given compensation only for the landholder'srights and not for the kudivaram (tenant's) rights also.(v) The expression ""passed by such legislature"" in article 31(4) of the Constitution means passed with or withoutamendments and the fact that the provisions relating to vesting of private lands did not form a part of the EstatesAbolition Bill as originally introduced but were added to the Bill after the new Constitution had come into forcewould not deprive those provisions of the protection of article 31(4) of the Constitution.(vi) The provision contained in section 37 of the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1950, for payment of compensationby 30 annual instalments is not a piece of colourable legislation. It comes clearly within entry 42 of List III ofSchedule VII of the Constitution.[ The question whether the provisions of the Madras Estates Land (Orissa Amendment) Act, 1947, whichempowered the Collector to settle and reduce rents were void because they involved an improper delegation oflegislative powers to the executive and contravened article 14 of the Constitution was raised, but with the consentof the counsel, their Lordships decided to leave the question open as it did not relate to the validity of the Orissa 3Estates Abolition Act, which was the subject-matter in dispute in the present case].State of Bihar v.

May 29. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.4 MUKHERJEA J.-These six appeals arise out of as many applications, presented to the High Court of Orissa, underarticle 226 of the Constitution, by the proprietors of certain permanently settled estates within the State of Orissa,challenging the constitutional validity of the legislation known as the Orissa Estates Abolition Act of 1952(hereinafter called ""the Act"") and praying for mandatory writs against the State Government restraining themfrom enforcing the provisions of the Act so far as the estates owned by the petitioners are concerned.The impugned Act was introduced in the Orissa State Legislature on the 17th of January, 1950, and was passed byit on the 28th September, 1951. It was reserved by the State Governor for consideration of the President and thePresident gave his assent on 23rd January, 1952. The Act thus receives the protection of articles 31(4) and 31A ofthe Constitution though it was not and could not be included in the list of statutes enumerated in the ninthschedule to the Constitution, as referred to in article 31B.The Act, so far as its main features are concerned, follows the pattern of similar statutes passed by the Bihar, UttarPradesh and Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assemblies. The primary purpose of the Act is to abolish all zemindaryand other proprietary estates and interests in the State of Orissa and after eliminating all the intermediaries, tobring the ryots or the actual occupants of the lands in direct contact with the State Government. It may beconvenient here to refer brieﬂy to some of the provisions of the Act which are material for our present purpose.The object of the legislation is fully set out in the preamble to the Act which discloses the public purposeunderlying it.Section 2(g) deﬁnes an ""estate"" as meaning any land held by an intermediary and included under one entry in anyof the general registers of revenue-paying lands and revenue-free lands prepared and maintained under the lawfor the time being in force by the Collector of a district. The expression ""intermediary"" with reference to any estateis then deﬁned and it 5 means a proprietor, sub-proprietor, landlord, landholder ...thikadar, tenure-holder, under-tenure-holder and includes the holder of inam estate, jagir and mauﬁ tenures andall other interests of similar nature between the ryot and the State. Section 3 of the Act empowers the StateGovernment to declare, by notiﬁcation, that the estate described in the notiﬁcation has vested in the State freefrom all encumbrances. Under section 4 it is open to the State Government, at any time before issuing suchnotiﬁcation, to invite proposals from ""intermediaries"" for surrender of their estates and if such proposals areaccepted, the surrendered estate shall vest in the Government as soon as the agreement embodying the terms ofsurrender is executed.The consequences of vesting either by issue of notiﬁcation or as a result of surrender are described in detail insection 5 of the Act . It would be suﬃcient for our present purpose to state that the primary consequence is that alllands comprised in the estate including communal lands, non-ryoti lands, waste lands, trees, orchards, pasturelands, forests, mines and minerals, quarries, rivers and streams, tanks, water channels, ﬁsheries, ferries, hats andbazars, and buildings or structures together with the land on which they stand shall, subject to the other provisionsof the Act, vest absolutely in the State Government free from all encumbrances and the intermediary shall ceaseto have any interest in them. Under section 6, the intermediary is allowed to keep for himself his homestead andbuildings and structures used for residential or trading purposes such as golas, factories, mills, etc., but buildingsused for oﬃce or estate purposes would vest in the Government. Section 7 provides that an intermediary will beentitled to retain all lands used for agricultural or horticultural purposes which are in his kha's possession at thedate of vesting. Private lands of the intermediary, which were held by temporary tenants under him, wouldhowever vest in the Government and the temporary tenants would be deemed to be tenants under theGovernment, except where the intermediary himself holds less than 33 acres of land in any capacity. As 6 regardsthe compensation to be paid for the compulsory acquisition of the estates, the principle adopted is that thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/0209595795995313 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…amount of compensation would be calculated at a certain number of years' purchase of the net annual income ofthe estate during the previous agricultural year, that is to say, the year immediately preceding that in which thedate of vesting falls. First of all, the gross asset is to be ascertained and by gross asset is meant the aggregate ofthe rents including all cesses payable in respect of the estate.From the gross asset certain deductions are made in order to arrive at the net income. These deductions includeland revenue or rent including cesses payable to the State Government, the agricultural 'income-tax payable in theprevious year, any sum payable as chowkidary or municipal tax in respect of the buildings taken over as oﬃce orestate buildings and also costs of management ﬁxed in accordance with a sliding percentage scale with referenceto the gross income. Any other sum payable as income-tax in respect of any other kind of income derived from theestate would also be included in the deductions. The amount of compensation thus determined is payable in 30annual equated instalments commencing from the date of vesting and an option is given to the State Governmentto make full payment at any time. These in brief are the main features of the Act.There was a fairly large number of grounds put forward on behalf of the appellants before the High Court inassailing the validity of the Act. It is to be remembered that the question of the constitutional validity of threeother similar legislative measures passed, respectively, by the Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya PradeshLegislative Assemblies had already come for consideration before this court and this court had pronounced all ofthem to be valid with the exception of two very minor provisions in the Bihar Act. In spite of all the previouspronouncements there appears to have been no lack of legal ingenuity to support the present attack upon theOrissa legislation, and as a matter of fact, much of the arguments put forward on behalf of the appellantspurported to have been based 7 on the majority judgment of this court in the Bihar appeals, where two smallprovisions of the Bihar Act were held to be unconstitutional.The arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants before the High Court have been classiﬁed by the learnedChief Justice in his judgment under three separate heads. In the ﬁrst place, there were contentions raised,attacking the validity of the Act as a whole. In the second place, the validity of the Act was challenged as far as itrelated to certain speciﬁed items of property included in an estate, e.g., private lands, buildings, waste lands, etc.Thirdly, the challenge was as to the validity of certain provisions in the Act relating to determination ofcompensation payable to the intermediary, with reference either to the calculation of the gross assets or thedeductions to be made therefrom for the purpose of arriving at the net income.The learned Chief Justice in a most elaborate judgment discussed all the points raised by the appellants andnegatived them all except that the objections with regard to some of the matters were kept open. Mr. JusticeNarasimham, the other learned Judge in the Bench, while agreeing with the Chief Justice as to other points,expressed,, in a separate judgment of his own, his suspicion about the bona ﬁdes of the Orissa AgriculturalIncome-tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1950, and he was inclined to hold that though ostensibly it was a taxationmeasure, it was in substance-nothing else but a colorable device to cut down drastically the income of theintermediaries so as to facilitate further reduction of their net income as provided in clause (b) of section 27(1) ofthe Act. He, however, did not dissent from the ﬁnal decision arrived at by the Chief Justice, the ground assignedbeing that whenever there is any doubt regarding the constitutionality of an enactment, the doubt should alwaysgo in favour of the legislature.The result was that with the exception of the few matters that were kept open, all the petitions were dismissed.The proprietors have now come before us on appeal on the strength of certiﬁcates granted by the High Courtunder articles 132 and 133 8 of the Constitution as well as under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.No contention has been pressed before us on behalf of the appellants attacking the constitutional validity of theAct as a whole. The arguments that have been advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants can beconveniently divided under three heads: In the ﬁrst place, there has been an attack on the validity of the provisionsof two other statutes, namely, the Orissa Agricultural Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1950, and the Madras EstatesLand (Amendment) Act, 1947, in so far as they aﬀect the calculation of the net income of an estate for the purposeof determining the compensation payable under the Act. In the second place, the provisions of the Act have beenchallenged as unconstitutional to the extent that they are applicable to private lands and buildings of theproprietors, both of which vest as parts of the estate, under section 5 of the Act. Lastly, the manner of payment ofcompensation money, as laid down in section 37 of the Act, has been challenged as invalid and unconstitutional.Under the ﬁrst head the appellants' main contention relates to the validity of the Orissa Agricultural Income-tax(Amendment) Act of 1950. This Act, it is said, is not a bona ﬁde taxation statute at all, but is a colorable piece ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/0209595795995413 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…legislation, the real object of which is to reduce, by artiﬁcial means, the net income of the intermediaries, so thatthe compensation payable to them under the Act might be kept down to as low a ﬁgure as possible. To appreciatethis contention of the appellants, it would be necessary to narrate a few relevant facts. Under section 27 (1)(b) ofthe Act, any sum payable in respect of an estate as agricultural income-tax, for the previous agricultural year,constitutes an item of deduction which has to be deducted from the gross asset of an estate for the purpose ofarriving at its net income, on the basis of which the amount of compensation is to be determined. The EstatesAbolition Bill was published in the local gazette on 3rd January 1950, As has been said 9 already, it was introducedin the Orissa Legislative Assembly on the 17th of January following and it was passed on the 28th September, 1951.There was an Agricultural Income-tax Act in force in the State of Orissa from the year 1947 which provided aprogressive scale of taxation on agricultural income, the highest rate of tax being 3 annas in the rupee on a slab ofover Rs. 30,000 received as agricultural income. On 8th January, 1950, that is to say, ﬁve days after the publicationof the Abolition Bill, an amended agricultural income-tax bill was published in the oﬃcial gazette. At that time Mr.H. K. Mahtab was the Chief Minister of Orissa and this bill was sponsored by him.The changes proposed by this Amendment Act were not very material. The highest rate was enhanced from 3annas to 4 annas in the rupee and the highest slab was reduced from Rs.30,000 to Rs. 20,000. For some reason or other, however, this bill was dropped and a revised bill was_ published inthe local gazette on 22nd July, 1950, and it passed into law on 10th of August following. This new Act admittedlymade changes of a very drastic character regarding agricultural income-tax. The rate of taxation was greatlyenhanced for slabs of agricultural income above Rs. 15,000 and for the highest slab the rate prescribed was asmuch as 12 annas 6 pies in the rupee. It was stated in the statement of objects and reasons that the enhancedagricultural income was necessary for ﬁnancing various development schemes in the State. This, it is said, waswholly untrue for it could not be disputed that almost all the persons who came within the higher income groupand were primarily aﬀected by the enhanced rates were intermediaries under the Estates Abolition Bill which wasat that time before the Select Committee and was expected to become law very soon, and as the legislature hadalready deﬁnitely decided to extinguish this class of intermediaries, it was absurd to say that an increased taxationupon them was necessary for the development schemes. The object of this amended legislation, according to theappellants, was totally diﬀerent from what it ostensibly purported 2 10 to be and the object was nothing else butto use it as a means of eﬀecting a drastic reduction in the income of the intermediaries, so that the compensationpayable to them may be reduced almost to nothing. This change in the provisions of the Agricultural Income-taxBill, it is further pointed out, synchronized with a change in the Ministry of the Orissa State. The original amendedbill was introduced by the then Chief Minister, Mr. H. K. Mahtab, who was in favour of allowing suitablecompensation to expropriated zemin.dars; but his successor, who introduced the revised bill, was said to be a champion of the abolition of zemindaryrights with little or no compensation to the proprietors.In these circumstances, the argument of the learned counsel is that the agricultural income-tax legislation beingreally not a taxation statute but a mere device for serving another collateral purpose constitutes a fraud on theConstitution and as such is invalid, either in its entirety, or at any rate to the extent that it aﬀects the estateabolition scheme. We have been referred to a number of decisions on this point where the doctrine of colourablelegislation came up for discussion before courts of law; and stress is laid primarily upon the pronouncement of themajority of this court in the case of The State of Bihar v. Maharaja Kameshwar Singh and Others (1) which held twoprovisions of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, namely, sections 4(b) and 23 (f) to be unconstitutional on the ground,among others, that these provisions constituted a fraud on the Constitution.The fact that the provisions in the amended Agricultural Income-tax Act were embodied in a separate statute andnot expressly made a part of the Abolition Act itself should not, it is argued, make any diﬀerence in principle. Asthe question is of some importance and is likely to be debated in similar cases in future, it would be necessary toexamine the precise scope and meaning of what is known ordinarily as the doctrine of ""colourable legislation"".It may be made clear at the outset that the doctrine of colourable legislation does not involve any question (1)[ 1952] S.C.R. 889.of bona ﬁdes or mala ﬁdes on the part of the legislature.The whole doctrine resolves itself into the, question of competency of a particular legislature to enact a particularlaw. If the legislature is competent to pass a particular law, the motives which impelled it to act are reallywww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/0209595795995513 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…irrelevant. On the other hand, if the legislature lacks competency, the question of motive does not arise at all.Whether a statute is constitutional or not is thus always a question of power( ' (1). A distinction, however, existsbetween a legislature which is legally omnipotent like the British Parliament and the laws promulgated by whichcould not be challenged on the ground of incompetency, and a legislature which enjoys only a limited or a qualiﬁedjurisdiction. If the Constitution of a State distributes the legislative powers amongst diﬀerent bodies, which haveto act within their respective spheres marked out by speciﬁc legislative entries, or if there are limitations on thelegislative authority in the shape of fundamental rights, questions do arise as to whether the legislature in aparticular case has or has not, in respect to the subject- matter of the statute or in the method of enacting it,transgressed the limits of its constitutional powers. Such transgression may be patent, manifest or direct, but itmay also be disguised, covert and indirect and it is to this latter class of cases that the expression ""colorablelegislation"" has been applied in certain Judicial pronouncements. The idea conveyed by the expression is thatalthough apparently a legislature in passing a statute purported to act within the limits of its powers, yet insubstance and in reality it transgressed these powers, the transgression being veiled by what appears, on properexamination, to be a mere presence or disguise. As was said by Duﬀ J. in Attorney-General for Ontario v.Reciprocal Insurers and Others(2), ""Where the law making authority is of a limited or qualiﬁed character it may benecessary to examine with some strictness the substance of the legislation (1) Vide Cooley's ConstitutionalLimitations Vol. I. p.379.(2) [ 1924] A.C. 328 at 337.12 for the purpose of determining what is that the legislature is really doing."" In other words, it is the substance ofthe Act that is material and not merely the form or outward appearance, and if the subject-matter in substance issomething which is beyond the powers of that legislature to legislate upon, the form in which the law is clothedwould not save it from condemnation. The legislature cannot violate the constitutional prohibitions by employingan indirect method.In cases like these, the enquiry must always be as to the true nature and character of the challenged legislation andit is the result of such investigation and not the form alone that will determine as to whether or not it relates to asubject which is within the power of the legislative authority(1). For the purpose of this investigation the courtcould certainly examine the eﬀect of the legislation and take into consideration its object, purpose or design(1).But these are only relevant for the purpose of ascertaining the true character and substance of the enactment andthe class of subjects of legislation to which it really belongs and not for ﬁnding out the motives which induced thelegislature to exercise its powers. It is said by Lefroy in his well known work on Canadian Constitution that even ifthe legislature avow on the face of an Act that it intends thereby to legislate in reference to a subject over which ithas no jurisdiction, yet if the enacting clauses of the Act bring the legislation within its powers, the Act cannot beconsidered ultra vires(3).In support of his contention that the Orissa Agricultural Income-tax (Amendment) Act of 1950 is a colorable pieceof legislation and hence ultra vires the Constitution, the learned counsel for the appellants, as said above, placedconsiderable reliance upon the majority decision of this- court in the case of The State of Bihar v. Sir KameshwarSingh(4), where two clauses (1) Vide Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers and Others, [ 1924] A.C.328 at 337.(2) Vide Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada, [ 19391 A.C. I 17 at 130.(3) See Lefroy on Canadian Constitution, page 75.(4) [ 1952] S.C.R. 889.13 of the Bihar Land Reform Act were held to be un- constitutional as being colourable exercise of legislativepower under entry 42 of List III of Schedule VII of the Constitution. The learned counsel has also referred us, in thisconnection, to a number of cases, mostly of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, where the doctrine ofcolourable legislation came up for consideration in relation to certain enactments of the Canadian and Australianlegislatures. The principles laid down in these decisions do appear to us to be fairly well settled, but we do notthink that the appellants in these appeals could derive much assistance from them.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/0209595795995613 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…In the cases from Canada, the question invariably has been whether the Dominion Parliament has, under colour ofgeneral legislation, attempted to deal with what are merely provincial matters, or conversely whether theProvincial legislatures under the pretence of legislating on any of the matters enumerated in section 92 of theBritish North America Act really legislated on a matter assigned to the Dominion Parliament. In the case of UnionColliery Company of British, Columbia Ltd. v. Bryden( ), the question raised was whether section 4 of the BritishColumbian Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1890, which prohibited China men of full age from employment in under-ground coal working, was, in that respect, ultra vires of the Provincial legislature. The question was answered inthe aﬃrmative. It was held that if it was regarded merely as a coal working regulation, it could certainly comewithin section 92, sub-section (10) or (13), of the British North America Act; but its exclusive application toChinamen, who were aliens or naturalised subjects, would be a statutory prohibition which was within theexclusive authority of the Dominion Parliament, con- ferred by section 91, sub-section (25), of the Act. As theJudicial Committee themselves explained in a later case(2), the regulations in the British Columbian Act ""were notreally aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth a device to deprive the Chinese, (1) [ 1899]UKLawRpAC 40; [ 1899] A.C. 580.(2) Vide Cunningham v. Tomeyhomma [ 1902] UKLawRpAC 54; [ 1903] A.C. 151 at 157.14 naturalised or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabit- ants of British Columbia and in eﬀect to prohibit theircontinued residence in that province since it prohibited their earning their living in that province."" On the otherhand, in ReInsurance Act of Canada(1), the Privy Council had to deal with the constitutionality of sections 11 and 12of the Insurance Act of Canada passed by the Dominion Parliament under which it was declared to be unlawful forany Canadian company or an alien, whether a natural person or a foreign company, to carry on insurance businessexcept under a licence from the Minister, granted pursuant to the provisions of the Act. The question was whethera foreign or British insurer licensed under the Quebec Insurance Act was entitled to carry on business within thatProvince without taking out a licence under the Dominion Act? It was held that sections 1 1 and 12 of the CanadianInsurance Act, which required the foreign insurers to be licensed, were ultra vires, since in the guise of legislationas to aliens and immigration -matters admittedly within the Dominion authority the Dominion legislature wasseeking to intermeddle with the conduct of insurance business which was a subject exclusively within theprovincial authority. The whole law on this point was thus summed up by Lord Maugham in Attorney-General forAlberta v.Attorney-General for Canada(2):""It is not competent either for the Dominion or a Province under the guise, or the pretence, or in the form of anexercise of its own powers to carry out an object which is beyond its powers and a trespass on the exclusive powerof the other."" The same principle has been applied where the question was not of one legislature encroaching uponthe exclusive ﬁeld of another but of itself violating any constitutional guarantee or prohibition. As an illustration ofthis type of cases we may refer to the Australian case of Moran v. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for NewSouth Wales(3).What happened (1)[ 1932] A.C. 41. (3) [ 1940] A.C.838.(2)[ 1939] A.C. 117 at 130.15 in that case was that in pursuance of a joint Commonwealth and States scheme to ensure to wheat growers inall the Australian States ""a payable price for their produce "" a number of Acts were passed by the CommonwealthParliament imposing taxes on ﬂour sold in Australia for home consumption, so as to provide a fund available forpayment of moneys to wheat growers. Besides a number of taxing statutes, which imposed tax on ﬂour, theWheat Industry Assistance Act No. 53 of 1938 provided for a fund into which the taxes were to be paid and of whichcertain payments were to be made to the wheat growers in accordance with State legislation. In the case ofTasmania where the quantity of wheat grown was relatively small but the taxes were imposed as in the otherStates, it was agreed as a part of the scheme and was provided by section 14 of the Wheat Industry Assistance Actthat a special grant should be made to Tasmania, not subject to any federal statutory conditions but intended tobe applied by the Government of Tasmania, in paying back to Tasmanian millers, nearly the whole of the ﬂour taxpaid by them and provision to give eﬀect to that purpose was made by the Flour Tax Relief Act No. 40 of 1938 ofthe State of Tasmania. The contention raised was that these Acts were a part of a scheme of taxation operatingand intended to operate by way of discriminating between States or parts of States and as such were contrary tothe provisions of section 51(ii) of the Commonwealth Australian Constitution Act. The matter came up forconsideration before a full court of the High Court of Australia and the majority of the Judges came to thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/0209595795995713 9/12/2K.C.

Evatt J. in a separate judgment dissented from the view and held that under the guise ofexecuting the powers under section 96 of the Constitution, the legislature had really violated the constitutionalprohibition laid down in section 51(ii) of the Constitution. There was an appeal taken to the Privy Council. The PrivyCouncil 16 aﬃrmed the judgment of the majority but pointed out that "" cases may be imagined in which apurported exercise of the power to grant ﬁnancial assistance under section 96 would be merely colourable. Underthe guise and pretence of assisting a State with money, the real substance and purpose of the Act might simply beto eﬀect discrimination in regard to taxation. Such an Act might well be ultra vires the CommonwealthParliament."" We will now come to the decision of the majority of this court regarding two clauses in the Bihar LandReforms Act which seems to be the sheet anchor of the appellants' case(1). In that case the provisions of sections23(f) and 4(b) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act were held to be invalid by the majority of this court not on the groundthat, in legislating on these topics, the State legislature had encroached upon the exclusive ﬁeld of the Centrallegislature, but that the subjectmatter of legislation did not at all come within the ambit of item No. 42 of List III,Schedule VII of the Constitution under which it purported to have been enacted. As these sections did not comewithin entry 42, the consequence was that half of the arrears of rent as well as 12'% of the gross assets of an estatewere taken away, otherwise than by authority of law and therefore there was a violation of fundamental rightsguaranteed by article 31 (1) of the Constitution. This was a form of colourable legislation which made theseprovisions ultra vires the Constitution.It may be stated here that section 23 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act lays down the method of computing the netincome of an estate or a tenure which is the subject-matter of acquisition under the Act. In arriving at the netincome certain deductions are to be made from the gross asset and the deductions include, among others,revenue, cess and agricultural income tax payable in respect of the properties and also the costs of management.Section 23 (f) provided another item of deduction under which a sum representing 4 to 121 % of the gross asset ofan estate was to be (1) Vide The State of Bihar v. Sir Kameshwar Singh, [ 1952] S.C.R. 889.17 deducted as ""costs of works for beneﬁt to the raiyat"". The other provision contained in section 4 (b) providesthat all arrears of rent which had already accrued due to the landlord prior to the date of vesting shall vest in theState and the latter would pay only 50% of these arrears to the landlord. Both these provisions purported to havebeen enacted under entry 42 of List III Schedule VII of the Constitution and that entry speaks of"" principles onwhich compensation for property acquired is to be -determined and the form and manner in which thatcompensation is to be given."" It was held in the Bihar case(1) by the majority of this court that the item ofdeduction provided for in section 23(f) was a ﬁctitious item wholly unrelated to facts. There was no deﬁnable pre-existing liability on the part of the landlord to execute works of any kind for the beneﬁt of the raiyat. What wasattempted to be done, therefore, was to bring within. the scope of the legislation something which not beingexistent at all could not have conceivable relation to any principle of compensation. This was, therefore, held to bea colourable piece of legislation which though purporting to have been made under entry 42 could not factuallycome within its scope.The same principle was held applicable in regard to acquisition of arrears of rent which had become due to thelandlord prior to the date of vesting. The net result of this provision was that the State Government was given thepower to appropriate to itself half of the arrears of rent due to the landlord without giving him any compensationwhatsoever. Taking the whole and returning the half meant nothing more or less than taking the half without anyreturn and this, it was held, could not be regarded as a principle of compensation in any sense of the word. It washeld deﬁnitely by one of the learned Judges, who constituted the majority, that item 42 of List III was nothing butthe description of a legislative head and in deciding the com- petency of the legislation under this entry, the courtis not concerned with the justice or propriety of the (1) [ 1952] S.C.R. 889.3 18 principles upon which the assessment of compensation is directed to be made; but it must be a principle ofcompensation, no matter whether it was just or unjust and there could be no principle of compensation basedupon something which was unrelated to facts. It may be mentioned here that two of the three learned Judges whoformed the majority did base their decision regarding the invalidity of the provision, relating to arrears of rent,mainly on the ground that there was no public purpose behind such acquisition. It was held by these Judges thatthe scope of article 31(4) is limited to the express provisions of article 31(2) and although the court could notexamine the adequacy of the provision for compensation contained in any law which came within the purview ofarticle 31(4), yet that clause did not in any way debar the court from considering whether the acquisition was forany public purpose. This view was not taken by the majority of the court and Mr.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/0209595795995813 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…Narasaraju, who argued the appeals before us, did not very properly pursue that line of reasoning. This being theposition, the question now arises whether the majority decision of this court with regard to the two provisions ofthe Bihar Act is really of any assistance to the appellants in the cases before us. In our opinion, the question has,got to be answered in the negative.In the ﬁrst place, the line of reasoning underlying the majority decision in the Bihar case(1) cannot possibly haveany application to the facts of the present case. The Orissa Agricultural Income-tax (Amendment) Act of 1950 iscertainly a legislation on "" taxing of agricultural income "" as described in entry 46 of List II of the Seventh Schedule.The State legislature had undoubted competency to legislate on agricultural income tax and the substance of theamended legislation of 1950 is that it purports to increase the existing rates of agricultural income-tax, the highestrate being ﬁxed at 12 annas 6 pies in the rupee. This may be unjust or inequitable, but that does not aﬀect thecompetency of the legislature. It cannot be said, as was said in the Bihar case(1), that the legislation purported tobe based (1) (1952) S.C.R. 889.19 on something which was unrelated to facts and did not exist at all. Both in form and in substance the Act was anagricultural income-tax legislation and agricultural income- tax is certainly a relevant item of deduction in thecomputation of the net income of an estate and is not unrelated to it as item No. 23(f) of the Bihar Act was held tobe. If under the existing law the agricultural income- tax was payable at a certain-rate and without anyamendment or change in the law, it was provided in the Estates Abolition Act that agricultural income-tax shouldbe deducted from the gross asset at a higher rate than what was payable under law, it might have been possible toargue that there being no pre-existing liability of this character it was really a non-existing thing and could not bean ingredient in the assessment of compensation. But here the Agricultural Income-tax (Amendment) Act waspassed in August, 1950. It came into force immediately thereafter and agricultural income-tax was realised on thebasis of the amended Act in the following year. It was, therefore, an existing liability in 1952, when the EstatesAbolition Act came into force. It may be that many of the people belonging to the higher income group diddisappear as a result of the Estates Abolition Act, but even then there were people still existing upon whom theAct could operate.The contention of Mr. Narasaraju really is that though apparently it purported to be a taxation statute comingunder entry 46 of List II, really and in substance it was not so. It was introduced under the guise of a taxationstatute with a view to accomplish an ulterior purpose, namely, to inﬂate the deductions for the purpose of valuingan estate so that the compensation payable in respect of it might be as small as possible. Assuming that it is so..still it cannot be regarded as a colourable legislation in accordance with the principles indicated above, unless theulterior purpose which it is intended to serve is something which lies beyond the powers of the legislature tolegislate upon. The whole doctrine of colourable legislation is based upon the maxim that you cannot do indirectlywhat you cannot do 20 directly. If a legislature is competent to do a thing directly, then the mere fact that itattempted to do it in an indirect or disguised manner, cannot make the Act invalid. Under entry 42 of List III whichis a mere head of legislative power the legislature can adopt any principle of compensation in respect to propertiescompulsorily acquired.Whether the deductions are large or small, inﬂated or deﬂated they do not aﬀect the constitutionality of alegislation under this entry' The only restrictions on this power, as -has been explained by this court in the earliercases, are those mentioned in article 31(2) of the Constitution and if in the circumstances of a particular case theprovision of article 31(4) is attracted to a legislation, no objection as to the amount or adequacy of thecompensation can at all be raised. The fact that the deductions are unjust, exorbitant or improper does not makethe legislation invalid, unless it is shown to be based on something which is unrelated to facts. As we have alreadystated, the question of motive does not really arise in such cases and one of the learned Judges of the High Courtin our opinion pursued a wrong line of enquiry in trying to ﬁnd out what actually the motives were which impelledthe legislature to act in this manner. It may appear on scrutiny that the real purpose of a legislation is diﬀerentfrom what appears on the face of it, but it would be a colourable legislation only if it is shown that the real object isnot attainable to it by reason of any constitutional limitation or that it lies within the exclusive ﬁeld of anotherlegislature. The result is that in our opinion the Orissa Agricultural Income-tax (Amendment) Act of 1950 could notbe held to be a piece of colourable legislation, and as such invalid. The ﬁrst point raised on behalf of the appellantsmust therefore fail.The other point raised by the learned counsel for the appellants under the ﬁrst head of his arguments relates tothe validity of certain provisions of the Madras Estates Land (Orissa Amendment) Act of 1947. This argument iswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/0209595795995913 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…applicable only to those estates which are 21 situated in what is known as ex-Madras area, that is to say, whichformerly belonged to the State of Madras but became a part of Orissa from 1st April, 1936. The law regulating therelation of landlord and tenant in these areas is contained in the Madras Estates Land Act of 1908 and this Act wasamended with reference to the areas situated in the State of Orissa by the amending Act XIX of 1947. Theprovisions in the amended Act, to which objections have been taken by the learned counsel for the appellants,relate to settlement and reduction of rents payable by raiyats. Under section 168 of the Madras Estates Land Act,settlement of rents in any village or area for which a record of rights has been published can be made either on theapplication of the landholder or the raivats. On such application being made, the Provincial Government may atany time direct the Collector to settle fair and equitable rents in respect of the lands situated therein. Sub-section(2) of section 168 expressly provides that in settling rents under this section, the Collector shall presume, until thecontrary is proved, that the existing rate of rent is fair and equitable, and he would further have regard to theprovisions of this Act for determining the rates of rent payable by raiyats. Section 177 provides that when any rentis settled under this chapter, it can neither be enhanced nor reduced for a period of 20 years, except on groundsspeciﬁed in sections 30 and 38 of the Act respectively.The amending Act of 1947 introduced certain changes in this law. A new section, namely, section 168-A was.introduced and a further provision was added to section 177 as sub- section (2) of that section, the original sectionbeing renumbered as sub-section (1). Section 168-A of the amended Act runs as follows:-- (1) Notwithstandinganything contained in this Act the Provincial Government may, on being satisﬁed that the exercise of the powershereinafter mentioned is necessary in the interests of public order or of the local welfare or that the rates of rentpayable in money or in kind whether commuted, settled or 22 otherwise ﬁxed are unfair or inequitable invest theCollector with the following powers:- (a) Power to settle fair and equitable rents in cash;(b) Power, when settling rents to reduce rents if in the opinion of the Collector the continuance of the existingrents would on any ground, whether speciﬁed in this Act or not, be unfair and inequitable.(2) The power given under this section may be made exercisable within speciﬁed areas either generally or withreference to speciﬁed cases or class of cases."" Sub-section (2) which has been added to section 177 stands thus:-- ""2(a) Notwithstanding anything in sub-section (1) where rent is settled under the provisions of section 168-A, theProvincial Government may either retrospectively or prospectively prescribe the date on which such settlementshall take eﬀect. In giving retrospective eﬀect the Provincial Government may, at their discretion, direct that therent so settled shall take eﬀect from a date prior to the commencement of the Madras Estates Land (OrissaAmendment) Act, 1947."" The appellants' contention is that by these amended provisions the ProvincialGovernment was authorised to invest the Collector with power to settle and reduce rents, in any way he liked,unfettered by any of the rules and principles laid down in the Act and the Provincial Government was also at libertyto direct that the reduction of rents should take eﬀect retrospectively, even with reference to a period for whichrents had already been paid by the tenant. Under section 26 of the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, the gross asset ofan estate is to be calculated on the basis of rents payable by raiyats for the previous agricultural year. According tothe appellants, the State Government made use of the provisions of the amended Madras Estates Land (OrissaAmendment) Act to reduce arbitrarily the rents payable by raiyats and further to make the reduction take eﬀectretrospectively, so that the diminished rents could be reckoned 23 as rents for the previous year in accordance withthe provision of section 26 of the Estates Abolition Act and thus deﬂate the basis upon which the gross asset of anestate was to be computed.It is conceded by the learned counsel for the appellants that the amendments in the Madras Estates Land Act areno part of the Estates Abolition Act of Orissa and there is no question of any colourable exercise of legislativepowers in regard to the enactment of these provisions. The legislation, however, has been challenged, asunconstitutional, on two grounds. First of all, it is urged that by the amended sections mentioned above, there hasbeen an improper delegation of legislative powers by the legislature to the Provincial Government, the latter beingvirtually empowered to repeal existing laws which govern the relations between landlord and tenant in thoseareas. The other ground put forward is that these provisions oﬀend against the equal protection clause embodiedin article 14 of the Constitution. It is pointed out that the Provincial Government is -given unfettered discretion tochoose the particular areas where the settlement of rent is to be made.The Government has also absolute power to direct that the reduced rents should take eﬀect either prospectivelyor retrospectively in particular cases as they deem proper. It is argued that there being no principle of classiﬁcationindicated in these legislative provisions and the discretion vested in the Government being an uncontrolled andunfetter- ed discretion guided by no legislative policy, the pro- visions are void as repugnant to article 14 of theCon- stitution.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/02095957959951013 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…In reply to these arguments it has been contended by the learned Attorney-General that, apart from the fact as towhether the contentions are well-founded or not, they are not relevant for purposes of the present case. Thearguments put forward by the appellants are not grounds of attack on the validity of the Estates Abolition Act,which, is the subject-matter of dispute in the present case, and it is not suggested that the provisions of theEstates Abolition Act relating to 24 the computation of gross asset on the basis of rents payable by raiyats is in anyway illegal. The grievance of the appellants in substance is that the machinery of the amended Act is being utilisedby the Government for the purpose of deﬂating the gross asset of an estate. We agree with the learned Attorney-General that if the appellants are right in their contention, they can raise these objections if and when the grossassets are sought to be computed on the basis of the rents settled under the above provisions. If the provisions arevoid, the rents settled in pursuance thereof could not legitimately form the basis of the valuation of the estateunder the Estates Abolition Act and it might be open to the appellants then to say that for purposes of section 26of the Estates Abolition Act, the rents payable for the previous year would be the rents settled under the MadrasEstates Land Act, as it stood unamended before 1947.The learned counsel for the appellants eventually agreed with the views of the Attorney-General on this point andwith the consent of both sides we decided to leave these questions open. They should not be deemed to havebeen de- cided in these cases.The appellants' second head of arguments relates to two items of property, namely, buildings and private lands ofthe intermediary, which, along with other interests, vest in the State under section 5 of the Act.There are diﬀerent provisions in the Act in regard to diﬀerent classes of buildings. Firstly, dwelling houses used byan intermediary for purposes of residence or for commercial or trading purposes remain with him on the footing ofhis being a tenant under the State in respect to the sites thereof and paying such fair and equitable rent as mightbe determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In the second place, buildings used primarily as oﬃceor kutchery for man agement of the estates or for collection of rents or as rest houses for estate servants or asgolas for storing of rents in kind vest in the State and the owner is allowed compensation in respect thereof. Inaddition to these, there are certain special provisions in the Act 25 relating to buildings constructed after 1stJanuary, 1946, and used for residential or trading purposes, in respect to which the question of bona ﬁdes as to itsconstruction and use might be raised and investigated by the Collector.There are separate provisions also in respect to buildings constructed before 1st January, 1946, which were not inpossession of the intermediary at the date of coming into force of the Act. The questions arising in regard to thisclass of cases have been left open by the High Court and we are not concerned with them in the present appeals.No objection has been taken by the appellants in respect to the provisions of the Act relating to buildings used forresidential or trade purposes. Their objections relate only to the building used for estate or oﬃce purposes whichvest in the State Government under the provisions of the Act.In regard to these provisions, it is urged primarily that the buildings raised on lands do not necessarily becomeparts of the land under Indian law and the legislature, therefore, was wrong in treating them as parts of the estatefor purposes of acquisition. This contention, we are afraid, raises an unnecessary issue with which we are not at allconcerned in the present cases. Assuming that in India there is no absolute rule of law that whatever is aﬃxed to orbuilt on the soil becomes a part of it and is subject to the same rights of property as the soil itself, there is nothingin law which prevents the State legislature from providing as a part of the estates abolition scheme that buildings,lying within the ambit of an estate and used primarily for management or administration of the estate.would vest in the Government as appurtenances to the estate itself. This is merely ancillary to the acquisition of anestate and forms an integral part of the abolition scheme.Such acquisition would come within article 31(2) of the Constitution and if the conditions laid down in clause (4) ofthat article are complied with, it would certainly attract the protection aﬀorded by that clause.Compensation has been pro. vided for these buildings in section 26(2) (iii) of the 4 26 Act and the annual rent ofthese buildings determined in the prescribed manner constitutes one of the elements for computation of the grossasset of an estate. The contention of the appellants eventually narrows down to this that the eﬀect of treating theannual valuation of the buildings as part of the gross asset of the estate in its entirety, leads to unjust results, for ifthese buildings were treated as separate properties, the intermediaries could have got compensation on a muchhigher scale in accordance with the slab system adopted in the Act. To this objection, two answers can be given. Inthe ﬁrst place, if these buildings are really appurtenant to the estate, they can certainly be valued as parts of thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/02095957959951113 9/12/2K.C. GAJAP ATI NARAYAN DEO AND OTH V. THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…estate itself. In the second place, even if the compensation provided for the acquisition of the buildings is not justand proper, the provision of article 31 (4) of the Constitution would be a complete answer to such acquisition.As regards the private lands of the proprietor, the appellants have taken strong exception to the provisions of theAct so far as they relate to private lands in possession of temporary tenants. In law these lands are in possession ofthe proprietor and the temporary tenants cannot acquire occupancy rights therein, yet they vest, under the Act, inthe State Government on the acquisition of an estate, the only exception being made in cases of small land-holders who do not hold more than 33 acres of land in any capacity.Section 8(1) of the Act gives the temporary tenants the right to hold the lands in their occupation under the StateGovernment on the same terms as they held them under the proprietor. Under the Orissa Tenants Protection Act,which is a temporary Act, the landholder is not entitled to get contractual or competitive rents from thesetemporary tenants in possession of his private lands and the rent is ﬁxed at two-ﬁfths of the gross produce. It is onthe basis of this produce rent which is included in the computation of the gross asset of an estate under section 26of the Act, that the land-holder gets compensation in respect to the private lands in occupation of temporarytenants. The appellants' main contention is that although in these lands 27 both the melvaram and kudivaramrights, that is to say, both the proprietor's as well as the raiyat's interests are united in the land-holder, theprovisions of the Act indicated above have given no compensation whatsoever for the kudivaram or the tenant'sright and in substance this interest has been conﬁscated without any return. This, in our opinion, is a wrong way oflooking at the provisions for compensation made in the Act. The Orissa Act, like similar Acts passed by thelegislatures of other States, provides for payment of compensation on the basis of the net income of the wholeestate. One result of the adoption of this principle, undoubtedly is, that no compensation is allowed in respect ofpotential values of properties; and those parts of an estate which do not fetch any income have practically beenignorned. There is no doubt that the Act does not give anything like a fair or market price of the propertiesacquired and the appellants may be right in their contention that the compensation allowed is inadequate andimproper; but that does not aﬀect the constitutionality of the provisions. In the ﬁrst place, no question ofinadequacy of compensation can be raised in view of the provision of article 31(4) of the Constitution and it cannotalso be suggested that the rule for payment of compensation on rental basis is outside the ambit of entry 42 of ListIll. This point is concluded by the earlier decision of this court in Raja Suriya Pal Singh v. The State of U.P.(1) and isnot open to further discussion. Mr. Narasaraju is not right in saying that the compensation for the private lands inpossession of temporary tenants has been given only for the landlord's interest in these properties and nothing hasbeen given in lieu of the tenant's interest. The entire interest of the proprietor in these lands has been acquiredand the compensation payable for the whole interest has been assessed on the basis of the net income of theproperty as represented by the share of the produce payable by the temporary tenants to the landlord. It is truethat the Orissa Tenants Protection Act is a temporary statute, but whether or not it is renewed in future, the (1)[ 1952] S.C.R. 1056.28 rent ﬁxed by it has been taken only as the measure of tile income derivable from these properties at the date ofacquisition.Mr. Narasaraju further argues that his clients are not precluded from raising any objection on the ground ofinadequacy of compensation in regard to these private lands by reason of article 31(4) of the Constitution, as theprovision of that article is not attracted to the facts of the present case. What is said is, that the original EstatesAbolition Bill, which was pending before the Orissa Legislature at the time when the Constitution came into force,did not contain any provision that the private lands of the proprietor in occupation of temporary tenants wouldalso vest in the State. This provision was subsequently introduced by way of amendment during the progress ofthe Bill and after the Constitution came into force. It is argued, therefore, that this provision is not protected byarticle 31(4). The contention seems to us to be manifestly untenable. Article 31(4) is worded as follows:- ""If any Billpending at the commencement of this -Constitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it has been passed bysuch Legislature, been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, then,notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court onthe ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2)."" Thus it is necessary ﬁrst of all that the Bill, whichultimately becomes law, should be pending before the State Legislature at the time of the coming into force of theConstitution. That Bill must be passed by the Legislature and then receive the assent of the President. It is the lawto which the assent of the President is given that is protected from any attack on the ground of non-compliancewith the provisions of clause (2) of article 31. The fallacy in the reasoning of the learned counsel lies in theassumption that the Bill has got to be passed in its original shape without any change whatsoever, before theprovision of clause (4) of article 31 could be attracted.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/49.html/02095957959951213 9/12/2K.C.

THE ST ATE OF ORISSA [13] INSC 49; AIR 13 SC 35; 14 SCR 1 (29 May 1…There is no 29 warrant for such assumption in the language of the clause.The expression ""passed by such Legislature"" must mean ""passed with or without amendments"" in accordance withthe normal procedure contemplated by article 107 of the Constitution. There can be no doubt that all therequirements of article 31(4) have been complied with in the present case and consequently there is no room forany objection to the legislation on the ground that the compensation provided by it is inadequate.The last contention of the appellants is directed against the provision of the Act -laying down the manner ofpayment of the compensation money. The relevant section is section 37 and it provides for the payment ofcompensation together with interest in 30 annual equated instalments leaving it open to the State to make thepayment in full at any time prior to the expiration of the period. The validity of this provision has been challengedon the ground that it is a piece of colourable legislation which comes within the principle enunciated by themajority of this court in the Bihar case referred to above. It is diﬃcult to appreciate this argument of the learnedcounsel. Section 37 of the Act contains the legislative provision regarding the form and the manner in which thecompensation for acquired properties is to be given and as such it comes within the clear language of entry 42 ofList III, Schedule VII of the Constitution. It is not a legislation on something which is non-existent or unrelated tofacts. It cannot also be seriously contended that what section 37 provides for, is not the giving of compensation butof negativing the right to compensation as the learned counsel seems to suggest.There is no substance in this contention and we have no hesitation in overruling it. The result is that all the pointsraised by the learned counsel for the appellants fail and the appeals are dismissed. Having regard to someimportant constitutional questions involved in these cases which needed clearing up, we direct that each partyshould bear his own costs in these appeals.Appeals dismissed.30 Agent for the appellant in Civil Appeal Nos. 71, 72, 73, 75 & 76: M.

COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, WEST BENGAL [1953] INSC 50; AIR 1953 SC 4…1953. September 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.-This is an appeal from ajudgment of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta answering a question referred to it by the Income-taxAppellate Tribunal under section 66 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.The appellant is a private limited company incorporated in the year 1935 under the Indian Companies 169 Act withthe following objects, among others, set out in the memorandum of association:To carry on and undertake any business, transaction, operation or work commonly carried on or undertaken bybankers, capitalists, promoters, ﬁnanciers, conces- sionaires, contractors, merchants, managers, managingagents, secretaries and treasurers.To purchase or otherwise acquire, and to sell.........stock, share......... business concerns and undertakings.To invest and deal with the moneys of the company not immediately required for the company's business uponsuch securities and in such manner as may from time to time be determined.The company held a large number of shares in other incorporated companies and was realising some of itsholdings and acquiring large blocks of shares in other companies. In the return for the assessment year 1938-39 thecompany showed a loss of Rs. 3,22,221 as a result of the sales of shares and securities during the previous year andthis was allowed as a business loss in the computation of its proﬁts. In the assessment for the years 1939-40, 1940-41 and 1941-42, however, the company claimed that the surplus resulting from similar sales during thecorresponding account years was not taxable income as such surpluses resulted from a mere change ofinvestments and was, therefore, a capital gain. The income-tax authorities rejected this claim and taxed thesurplus in each of those years as the proﬁts and gains of the company's business of dealing in shares. On appeal,the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal conﬁrmed the assessment orders but on some- what diﬀerent grounds. After anelaborate analysis of such transactions from the commencement of the company's business, the Tribunal came tothe following conclusion:""From the foregoing particulars it is clear that the company has been ﬁnancing and promoting the business ofother companies. For this purpose, it had to vary its holdings from time to time, quite a number of shares held bythe company have been of a speculative character. To hold these investments and to ﬁnance 170 severalcompanies (managed or otherwise) the appellant company had to resort to obtaining loans and overdrafts. It is,therefore, clear that shares were acquired by the appellant company in the ordinary course of its business and theybecame its stock-in-trade. The proﬁt on sale of these shares did not essentially arise out of the sale of investmentof any surplus funds. It is, therefore, clear that the sale of investments and making of fresh investments are linkedup with the business of the company as ﬁnanciers, inasmuch as investing and realising its holdings when ﬁnancewere needed is part of the normal business of the company......... There is ample evidence to show that thecompany did in fact carry on the business of ﬁnanciers, which is one of the objects mentioned in clause 3 (1) of thememorandum of association. The evidence pertaining to the ﬁnancial transactions of the company, during therelevant accounting years, to which we have referred, clearly establishes that the realisation of proﬁts oninvestment is directly referable to the carrying on of the company's business as ﬁnanciers."" In this view, theTribunal considered it unnecessary to decide whether the proﬁts are taxable as proﬁts and gains of the companyfrom the business of dealing in shares.On application by the company the Tribunal referred the following question to the High Court for its decisionOn the facts and circumstances of the case, is the surplus realised by the company on the sales of shares andsecurities a taxable income ? The court answered the question in the aﬃrmative but gave leave to the company toappeal to this court.The principle applicable in all such cases is well settled and the question always is whether the sales whichproduced the surplus were so connected with the carrying on of the assessee's business that it could fairly be saidthat the surplus is the proﬁts and gains of such business. It is not necessary that the surplus 171 should haveresulted from such a course of dealing in securities as by itself would amount to the carrying on of a business ofbuying and selling securities. It would be enough if such sales were eﬀected in the usual course of carrying on thebusiness or, in the words used by the Privy Council in Punjab Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. Income-tax Commissioner,Lahore(1), if the realisation of securities is a normal step in carrying on the assessee's business.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/50.html23/ 9/12/2020SARDAR INDRA SINGH AND SONS LTD.

Thequestion is primarily one of fact and there are numerous cases falling on either side of the line but illustrating thesame principle. On the facts found in regard to the nature and course of the company's business, there can be nodoubt that the present case falls on the Revenue's side of the line.Agreeing with the High Court that there was ample material upon which the Appellate Tribunal could arrive at theconclusion which they did, we dismiss the appeal with costs.Appeal dismissed.Agent for the appellant: S.

COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, U.P [1953] INSC 51 ; AIR 1953 SC 456; 1954 SCR 158 (23 S…1953. September 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI C. J.-This batch of appealsarises out of a reference made to the High Court at Allahabad by the Income- tax Appellate Tribunal, AllahabadBench, under section 26 of the Excess Proﬁts Tax Act, hereinafter referred to as "" the Act."" The assessmentschallenged in these appeals relate to diﬀerent chargeable accounting periods but the questions raised are thesame in all the cases.The appellants constitute a Hindu undivided family consisting of four branches representing the four sons of oneSohan Pathak deceased. The family carried on business at Banaras in money-lending and Banaras brocade underthe name and style of Sohan Pathak & Sons. In the assessment relating to the chargeable accounting periodending on October 8, 1943, the appellants alleged that there was a partial partition among the members of thefamily on July 16, 1943, whereby the Banaras brocade business was divided in equal shares among the fourbranches and that, on the next day, the adult members of the family formed two partnerships admitting theminors to the beneﬁts thereof, and thereafter carried on business in Banaras 160 brocade under the respectiveﬁrm names of Sohan Pathak Girdhar Pathak and G. M. Pathak & Co. The appellants claimed that the family as suchceased to carry on business in Banaras brocade after July 16, 1943, though they continued to remain joint in statusand that the proﬁts derived by the two partnerships aforesaid after July 17, 1943, could not be assessed as proﬁtsof the original joint family business, as the businesses carried on by the two partnerships were distinct and newlystarted businesses and could neither in law nor in fact be regarded as continuation of the old brocade business. Insupport of this claim the appellants strongly relied on the circumstance that the Income-tax Oﬃcer treated the oldbusiness as discontinued by the family after the partial partition and granted relief on that footing under section25(3) of the Indian Income-tax Act in the assessment to income-tax of the appellants as a Hindu undivided family.The Excess Proﬁts Tax Oﬃcer, however, rejected the claim as he was of opinion that the main purpose of thepartial partition and the creation of the two partnerships was to avoid or reduce the liability of the appellants toexcess proﬁts tax, and he made adjustments under section 10-A of the Act by adding to the proﬁts made by theappellants as a joint Hindu family till the date of the partition the proﬁts made by the two ﬁrms during thechargeable accounting periods. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal conﬁrmed theﬁnding and order of the Excess Proﬁts Tax Oﬃcer, but, at the instance of the appellants, the Tribunal referred thefollowing questions to the High Court for its decision:1.Whether in view of the fact that the partial partition bad been accepted by the Income-tax Oﬃcer and thebusiness was treated as having been discontinued for the purpose of assessment under the Income-tax Act, thesame business could legally be treated as having continued unbroken in respect of the same chargeableaccounting period for the purpose of section 10-A of the Excess Proﬁts Tax Act read with sections 4 and 5 of thesame Act ? 161 2.Whether in the circumstances of the case the eﬀect of the partial partition of the Hindu undividedfamily on July 16, 1943, and the formation of two diﬀerent ﬁrms was a transaction within the meaning of section10-A of the Excess Proﬁts Tax Act ? 3.Whether on the facts found by the Tribunal as stated in para. 7 of thestatement of the case, it was justiﬁed to draw the inference that the main purpose behind the partial partition wasthe avoidance or reduction of liability to excess proﬁts tax ? The court answered these questions against theappellants but granted leave to appeal to this court.At a previous hearing of these appeals this court was of opinion that the material facts relating to the partialpartition and the formation of the partnership and the ﬁndings of the Tribunal in regard thereto had not beenclearly stated by the Tribunal in the original statement of the case. The court said:"" While it is true that in one place in the statement of case the Tribunal speaks of the old family brocade businessas continuing without a break after the partial partition, reference is made in another place to the assets of thatbusiness having been equally divided among the four branches forming the family. There is thus no clear ﬁnding asto how the partition of the brocade business was actually eﬀected-whether by a division in shares, each branchholding its share in severalty and the business being carried on as before on a partnership basis, or whether by anactual distribution and allotment of speciﬁc assets and liabilities among the branches resulting in the disruption ofthat business."" The court accordingly by its order of January 12, 1953, called for a further and clearer statement ofthe facts on the points indicated.The Tribunal has since submitted a supplementary statement of the case fully setting out the details of thepartition arrangement and the constitution of the two ﬁrms by the members of the family after the partition. Thestatement reveals that the bulk of the 162 capital as well as all "" the stock in trade, the cash in hand, the cash inbanks, all outstandings as on that date as also the sundry liabilities up to that day "" were divided amongst each ofthe 14 coparceners each branch being allotted a four-anna share as stated in the schedule ﬁled by the assesseesand annexed to the statement, showing that the partition was by speciﬁc distribution of the assets and liabilitieswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/51.html2/5 9/12/2020SOHAN PATHAK AND SONS V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, U.P [1953] INSC 51 ; AIR 1953 SC 456; 1954 SCR 158 (23 S…and not by a division of shares merely. With the assets and liabilities thus distributed, the two partnershipsseparately carried on brocade businesses similar to the one carried on by the joint family before the partialpartition. The names of the partners of the two ﬁrms are mentioned and it appears that each ﬁrm consisted ofmembers representing all the four branches, some of them being adults and some minors, the minors in each casebeing only admitted to the beneﬁts of -the partnerships.On these facts it was contended by Mr. Pathak on behalf of the appellants that the ﬁnding of the Excess Proﬁts TaxOﬃcer that the main purpose of the partial partition and the formation of the new partnerships was to avoid orreduce the liability of the appellants to excess proﬁts tax was not supported by any material on record. Secondly,assuming that there was material on which the oﬃcer could have come to such a ﬁnding, the old family business inBanaras brocade having been actually closed down, the oﬃcer had no power in assessing the proﬁts of thatbusiness to make adjustments under section 10-A of the Act by adding the proﬁts made by the two ﬁrms after July17, 1943. And lastly, and alternatively, there was undoubtedly a change in the persons carrying on the old businessafter July 16, 1943, even if it were regarded as still continuing, the Hindu undivided family being a ""person"" [ section2(17)] distinct from the individuals Composing it, and such business' must, under section 8(1), be deemed for all thepurposes of the Act (except for one not material here) to have been discontinued and a new business to have beencommenced, and the same consequences followed. Mr. Patbak did not argue 163 that the partial partition and theconstitution of the two partnerships were not ""transactions"" within the meaning of section 10-A. Nor did he insistthat the acceptance of the partition and allowance of relief by the Income-tax Oﬃcer under section 25(4) of theIncome-tax Act concluded the matter for purposes of section 10-A of the Act, as appears to have been contendedin the earlier stages of these proceedings.The ﬁrst contention can be disposed of in a few words. It appears from the facts found by the tax authorities aswell as by the Appellate Tribunal that the partial partition and the formation of the partnerships were broughtabout at a time when the proﬁts of the Banaras brocade business showed a deﬁnitely upward trend. If the mainpurpose of these transactions was not to evade liability to excess proﬁts tax, the appellants were asked to explainwhat the purpose was, and they said that they wanted to protect the interests of the minor members whoseshares in the partnership assets would not be liable for the losses, if any, of the ﬁrms, while the entire familyproperties would be liable for any loss incurred in the family business. This explanation was not acceptablebecause such protection was not thought of when the family business was earning smaller proﬁts and alsobecause, according to the constitution of the partnerships, while each branch was given the same 4as.interest, the responsibility for losses falling on the branch which had no minor members would be heavier thanwhat would be borne by the branch which had no adult members, a disparity which the purpose put forward by theappellants failed to explain. In these circumstances we agree with the High Court -in holding that there wassuﬃcient material to support the inference drawn by the Appellate Tribunal that the main purpose behind thepartial partition and the formation of the partnerships was the avoidance or reduction of liability of the familybusiness to excess proﬁts tax.The real and substantial question in the appeals is whether in view of the ﬁnding of fact that the old familybusiness was wound up, its assets and liabilities 164 having been actually distributed among the coparceners, andwas no longer carried on by the joint family as such during the relevant chargeable accounting periods,' section 10-A has any application to the case. Question No. 1, which is supposed to have raised this point, was not happilyframed.As already stated, Mr. Pathak did not argue that the Income- tax Oﬃcer's ﬁnding as to the discontinuance of theold family business precluded the Excess Proﬁts Tax Oﬃcer from considering the issue. It is now well settled that,for the purposes of the Act, a business is a unit of assess- ment, and the charging section 4 provides for the taxbeing levied in respect of the proﬁts of "" any business to which this Act applies."" Section 5 speciﬁes the businessesto which the Act applies, and they are businesses "" of which any part of the proﬁts made during the chargeableaccounting period is chargeable to income-tax "" by virtue of certain speciﬁed provisions of the Indian Income-taxAct, 1922. There are some provisos to this section, one of which excludes the application of the Act to "" anybusiness the whole of the proﬁts of which accrue or arise in a Part B State."" It is thus manifest that the Act can haveno application to a business which did not make any proﬁts during the relevant chargeable accounting period. Inother words, if a business, having been discontinued, earned no proﬁt during the chargeable accounting period inquestion, no excess proﬁts tax can be charged in respect of such business, and that being the position here asrespects the old joint family business in Banaras brocade, the appellants are not liable to be taxed as a Hinduundivided family in respect of that business.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/51.html3/5 9/12/2020SOHAN PATHAK AND SONS V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, U.P [1953] INSC 51 ; AIR 1953 SC 456; 1954 SCR 158 (23 S…But, argues the learned Attorney-General, that result cannot follow by reason of section 10-A of the Act whichruns as follows:10-A. Transactions designed to avoid or reduce liability to exces proﬁts tax.-(1) Where the Excess Proﬁts TaxOﬃcer is of the opinion that the main purpose for which any transaction or transactions was or were eﬀected -(whether before or after the passing of the 165 Excess Proﬁts Tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1941) was theavoidance or reduction of liability to excess proﬁts tax, he may, with the previous approval of the InspectingAssistant Commissioner, make such adjustments as respects liability to excess proﬁts tax as he considersappropriate so as to counteract the avoidance or reduction of liability to excess proﬁts tax which would otherwisebe eﬀected by the transaction or transactions.This provision, it is claimed, empowers the Excess Proﬁts Tax Oﬃcer to ignore any transaction (s) the main purposeof which was the avoidance or reduction of liability to excess proﬁts tax and to proceed on the footing that suchtransactions) had not been eﬀected, and, in the present case, the partial partition as well as the subsequentformation of the partnerships having been found to be transactions the main purpose of which was the avoidanceor reduction of liability to excess proﬁts tax, the oﬃcer had authority to assess the appellants' old family businessin Banaras brocade on the basis of its continued existence during the relevant chargeable accounting periods. Weare unable to accept this contention.If, under section 4 of the Act read with section 5, the old joint family business cannot be regarded as one "" to whichthis Act applies,"" section 10-A, one of the provisions of the Act, can have no application to such business. Thelearned Attorney-General's argument that sections 4 and 5 must be read along with section 10-A in determiningwhether the Act applies to any particular business or not involves the fallacy that, in determining the initial issuewhether the Act does or does not apply to a given business, you have to look not merely at the provision whichdeﬁnes the scope and application of the Act but other provisions also which presuppose its application. We are ofopinion that the issue whether the Act applies or not to a particular business must be determined solely withreference to section 5, and section 10-A must be construed as 23 166 applicable only to cases where, the businessbeing found to be one to which the Act applies, a transaction of the kind referred to in the section has beeneﬀected. The learned Attorney-General conceded that, if a person who had been paying excess proﬁts taxtransferred the business to a Part B State, it would not be competent for the Excess Proﬁts Tax Oﬃcer to takeaction under section 10-A to make adjustments on the footing that the assessee continued to carry on his businessin the same place as before such transfer, even if it was found that the transfer was eﬀected for the main purposeof avoiding or reducing his liability to excess proﬁts tax. In that case, the Attorney-General admitted, the Oﬃcerwould be running counter to the express prohibition contained in the proviso to section 5 to which reference hasbeen made and he did not challenge the correctness of a decision to that eﬀect by the Bombay High Court,(Commissioner of Excess Proﬁts Tax, Bombay City v. Moholal Maganlal) (1). But we fail to appreciate thedistinction in principle between that case and the present, for, to both alike the Act is made inapplicable by section5. The reasoning of the learned Judges in the Bombay case, namely, that if the Act is inapplicable to a particularbusiness and there would thus be no liability to excess proﬁts tax in respect of that business, no question couldarise of avoiding or reducing any liability to excess proﬁts tax under section 10-A, would equally apply to thepresent case and must lead to the same result.Reference was made by the Attorney-General in the course of his argument to the proviso to section 2(5) whichsays that "" all businesses to which this Act applies carried on by the same person shall be treated as one businessfor the purposes of this Act."" We ﬁnd it diﬃcult to appreciate the bearing of this section on the point at issue. It isclear that the proviso can operate in respect of businessess to which the Act applies and not otherwise, and itcarries the, matter no further.(1) [ 1953] 23 1. T. R, 45.167 In the view we have expressed above, it is unnecessary to deal with the alternative contention based on section8(1) of the Act.We allow the appeals, set aside the answer made by the High Court to question No. 1 and answer it as follows: Inview of the ﬁnding of fact that the old joint family business in Banaras brocade was wound up and was no longercarried on by the joint family as such during the relevant chargeable accounting periods, the same business couldnot legally be treated as having continued unbroken in respect of such periods for the purpose of section 10-A ofthe Excess Proﬁts Tax Act read with sections 4 and 5 of the same Act.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/51.html4/5 9/12/2020SOHAN PATHAK AND SONS V.

The High Court answered the question referred in theaﬃrmative. It upheld the view taken by the Tribunal.It was contended before us that the construction placed by the High Court upon section 25(4) of the Act waserroneous and was not warranted by the language of the section and that by reason of the change in thecomposition of the ﬁrm the same ﬁrm did not continue throughout and hence there was no right to relief undersection 25(4) of the Act in the changed ﬁrm. In our opinion, this contention is without force. Section 25 (4) is inthese terms:- ""Where the person who was at the commencement of the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act,1939, carrying on any business, profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisionsof the Indian Income-tax Act, 1918, is succeeded in such capacity by another person, the change not being 175merely a change in the constitution of a partnership, no tax shall be payable by the ﬁrst mentioned person inrespect of the income, proﬁts and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of suchsuccession, and such person may further claim that the income, proﬁts and gains of the previous year shall bedeemed to have been the income, proﬁts and gains of the said period. Where any such claim is made, anassessment shall be made on the basis of the income, proﬁts and gains of the said period, and, if an amount of taxhas already been paid in respect of the income, proﬁts and gains of the previous year exceeding the amount.la. og/in/cs/ cn/IC/1953/52.h2/3COMMISSIONENCOMESNIGGIERNSwwwiiofindiraseeNStml 9/12/2020R OF IE- TAX, WT B EGAL V.

The section does not regard amere change in the personnel of the partners as amounting to succession and disregards such a change. It followsfrom the provisions of the section that a mere change in the constitution of the partnership does not necessarilybring into existence a new assessable unit or a distinct assessable entity and in such a case there is no devolutionof the business as a whole.It is true that under the law of partnership a ﬁrm has no legal existence apart from its partners and it is merely acompendious name to describe its partners but it is also equally true that under that law there is no dissolution ofthe ﬁrm by the mere incoming or outgoing of partners. A partner can retire with the consent of the other partnersand a person can be introduced in the partnership by the consent of the other partners. The reconstituted ﬁrm cancarry on its business in the same ﬁrm's name till dissolution. The law with respect to retiring partners as enacted inthe Partnership Act is to a certain extent a compromise between the strict doctrine of English common law whichrefuses to see anything in the ﬁrm but a collective name for individuals carrying on business in partnership and themercantile usage which recognizes the ﬁrm as a distinct person or quasi corporation. But under the Income-tax Actthe position is somewhat diﬀerent. A ﬁrm can be charged as a distinct assessable entity as distinct from its 176partners who can also be assessed individually. Section 3 which is the charging section is in these terms:Where any Central Act enacts that income-tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates tax at that rate orthose rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, this Act in respect ofthe total income of the previous year of every individual, Hindu undivided family, company and local authority, andof every ﬁrm and other association of persons or the partners of the ﬁrm or the members of the associationindividually."" The partners of the ﬁrm are distinct assessable entities, while the ﬁrm as such is a separate anddistinct unit for purposes of assessment. Sections 26, 48 and 55 of the Act fully bear out this position. Theseprovisions of the Act go to show that the technical view of the nature of a partnership under English law or Indianlaw cannot be taken in applying the law of incometax. The true question to decide is one of identity of the unitassessed under the Income-tax Act, 1918, which paid double tax in the year 1939, with the unit to whose businessthe private limited company succeeded in the year 1947. We have no doubt that the Tribunal and the High Courtwere right in holding that in spite of the mere changes in the constitution of the ﬁrm, the business of the ﬁrm asoriginally constituted continued as tea brokers right from its inception till the time it was succeeded by the limitedcompany and that it was the same unit all through, carrying on the same business, at the same place and therewas no cesser of that business or any change in the unit. Reference was made by Mr. Daphtary to the partnershipdeed drawn up in 1945. It was argued that a diﬀerent ﬁrm was then constituted. The High Court refused to lookinto this document as it had not been relied upon before the Tribunal and no reference bad been speciﬁcally madeto it in the order of the Incometax Oﬃcer or the Assistant Commissioner. The Tribunal in spite of this documenttook the view that under the Partnership Act a ﬁrm could be carried on even if there was a change in itsconstitution. This 177 document is silent on the -question as to what happened to the assets and liabilities of theﬁrm that was, constituted under the deed of 1939. To all intents and purposes the ﬁrm as reconstituted was not adiﬀerent unit but it remained the same unit in spite of the change in its constitution.The result is that we see no substantial grounds for disturbing the opinion given by the High Court on the questionsubmitted to it. The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.Agent for the appellant: G. H. Rajadhyaksha.Agent for the respondents: P. K.

A. W. FS & CO., & OS [1953] IC 52 ; AIR 1953 SC 455; 1954 SAct, whereby the High Court answered the question referred in the aﬃrmative.…The assessee is a partnership concern. When income-tax was paid under the Act of 1918, the partnership concernconsisted of three partners, Mathews, Figgies and Notley.The name of the ﬁrm was A. W. Figgies & Co., and its' business was that of tea brokers. There were severalchanges in the constitution of the ﬁrm resulting in a change in the shares of 173 the partners. In 1924, Mathewswent out and his share was taken over by Figgies and Notley. In 1926 another partner Squire was introduced. In1932 Figgies went out, and from 1932 to 1939 the partnership consisted only of Notley and Squire. In 1939 Hillmanwas brought in and the partnership consisted of these three partners. In 1943 Notley went out and the partnershipbusiness was carried on by the two partners, Squire and Hillman. In 1945 Gilbert was brought in. This arrangementcontinued up to 31st May, 1947, when the partnership was converted into a limited company.For the assessment year 1947 -48 the assessee claimed that it was entitled to relief under section 25(4) of the Actas the partnership ﬁrm had been succeeded by a private limited company. There was a provision in the partnershipdeed of 1939 that on the retirement of any partner the partnership would not be determined but would be carriedon by the remaining partners. It appears that a fresh partnership deed was drawn up in the year 1945 when Gilbertwas brought in. The partnership constituted by these three partners continued to carry on the same business thathad been started when the tax was paid under the Act of 1918. From the statement of the case it does not appearthat apart from the mere change in the personnel of the partners and in their respective shares there was anyactual dissolution of the ﬁrm, and any division of its assets and liabilities or a succession to its business by anyoutside person.The Income-tax Oﬃcer disallowed the claim of the assessee on the ground that the partners of the ﬁrm in 1939being diﬀerent from the partners of the ﬁrm in 1947, no relief could be given to the applicant. The AppellateAssistant Commissioner upheld this view. On appeal to the Income-tax Tribunal, this decision was reversed andrelief was granted to the applicant under section 25(4). Before the Tribunal it was argued on behalf of theCommissioner that the partnership was nothing but an association of persons and therefore, in 24 174 order to getrelief under section 25(4) of the Act the partners of 1939 must be the same as the partners of 1947 when the ﬁrmwas succeeded by the company. The Tribunal repelled this contention and held that the relief contemplated bysection 25(4) of the Income-tax Act was to be given to the business and not to the persons carrying on the businessand that mere changes in the constitution of the ﬁrm had to be ignored. It was not disputed before the Tribunalthat the business of the partnership ﬁrm of A. W.Figgies & Co. continued as tea brokers right from its inception till the time it was succeeded by the limitedcompany. The Tribunal took the view that for purposes of incometax the ﬁrm was to be regarded as having aseparate juristic existence apart from the partners carrying on the business and that the ﬁrm could be carried oneven if there was a change in its constitution.At the instance of the appellant the Tribunal stated a case and referred the following question to the High Courtunder section 66(1) of the Act"

Umrigar for respondents Nos. 3 and 4.1953. October 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.Civil Appeal No. 53 of 1951.This appeal is on behalf of the plaintiﬀ and is directed against a judgment and decree of a Division Bench of thePatna High Court, dated the 8th of September, 1948, modifying those of the Additional Subordinate 179 Judge,Motihari, passed in Partition Suit No. 108/6 of 1943/46. There were two money suits between the same partieswhich were tried along with the suit for partition and both of them were decreed by the trial judge, but dismissedby the High Court on appeal. Civil Appeals Nos.54 and 55 of this court arise out of these appeals and we will deal with them separately.So far as the main appeal is concerned, the material facts are uncontroverted and the dispute centres round oneshort point, which relates to the extent of share in the disputed properties to which the plaintiﬀ can be said to haveacquired a legal title. The plaintiﬀ averred that he was entitled to a 4 annas share in the schedule lands and thisclaim was allowed by the trial judge. The High Court held, on the other band, that the plaintiﬀ 's title extended onlyto 1 anna 4 pies share in the disputed properties, and with regard to this share alone he could claim partition. It isthe propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us in this appeal.To appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the parties before us, it may be convenient to narrate a fewmaterial facts. The properties in suit, which are comprised in Tauzi No. 703 of the Champaran Collectorate,belonged admittedly to the defendants ﬁrst party and their ancestors. Defendant No. 1, Bhubneshwar Prasad,who is the main defendant in the present litigation, borrowed a sum of money from one Panchanan Banerjee onthe basis of a promissory note some time before 1932. Panchanan instituted a suit in the Court of the SubordinateJudge at Motihari against Bhubneshwar for recovery of this loan and having obtained a decree, put the decree inexecution in Execution Case No. 16 of 1932 of the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Motihari. In course of theseproceedings, the right, title and interest of the judgment-debtor in the properties in suit, which was described asamounting to 4 annas share in the same, was put up to sale and purchased by the decreeholder himself on 7th ofSeptember, 1932. The purchaser got delivery of possession on January 25, 1935.It is 180 admitted that at the time of the sale, Bhubneshwar along with his grand-father Bishun Prakash, his fatherLachmi Prasad and his two sons who are defendants 2 and 3 in the suit, constituted an undivided Hindu family, ofwhich apparently his grand-father was the karta; and it is not disputed that if a partition had taken place at thattime, Bhubneshwar Prasad along with his sons would have got 4 annas share in the joint ancestral property.Panchanan sold the interest purchased by him at the execution sale to the plaintiﬀ by a conveyance dated the 1stof February, 1935, and it is on the strength of this conveyance that the plaintiﬀ instituted the present suit claimingspeciﬁc allotment of a 4 annas share in the suit properties.Bhubneshwar and his three son&, to wit, defendants 2, 3 and 4, are the main defendants in the suit and it is notdisputed that at the present moment they own the remaining 12 annas share in the suit properties. Thedefendants 5, 6 and 7 were impleaded as parties defendants on the allegation that they held diﬀerent portions ofthe joint properties as zarpeshgidars under the 12 annas proprietors.The suit was contested primarily by defendant No. 1 and the substantial contention put forward by him was that asthe money suit was instituted by Panchanan against him alone and his sons were not made parties either to thesuit or the execution proceeding, his own undivided interest in the joint family properties and not that of his sonspassed by the sale. Consequently, the execution creditor could not by his purchase acquire more than 1 anna 4 piesshare in the suit properties and to this share alone the plaintiﬀ could legitimately lay a claim. This contention wasrepelled by the Subordinate Judge who took the view that as the debt contracted by Bhubneshwar was not forimmoral purposes, it was open to his creditor to realise his dues not merely from the father's undividedcoparcenary interest in the ancestral property but from the entire interest of the father and the sons in the same..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/54.h/0209595895wwwiiofindirasee95tml26 9/12/2SIDHESHW AR MUKHERJEE V . BHUBNESHWAR PRASAD NARAINSINGH & ORS [13] INSC 54; AIR 13 SC 47; 14 SCR …The execution proceedings showed that the creditor intended to attach and sell the interest of the sons as well andunless, 181 therefore, the sons succeeded in showing that the debts were such which they were not obliged to payunder the rules of Hindu law, the fact that they were not made parties to the proceedings was altogetherimmaterial. The result was that the trial judge allowed the plaintiﬀ 's claim in its entirety and passed a preliminarydecree declaring the plaintiﬀ 's one-fourth share in the schedule properties.The defendant No. 1 thereupon took an appeal to the High Court. The learned Judges of the High Court, whoheard the appeal, were of the opinion that the decision of the trial court would have been unassailable if thedefendant No. I was the head of a joint family consisting of himself and his sons. In such cases he could haverepresented the interests of his sons and the entire interest could have been sold in the execution sale. But as inthis case the plaintiﬀ himself was a junior member of the family, he had neither any right of disposition over theinterests of his sons, nor could he represent them in any suit or proceeding. What the purchaser acquired by theexecution sale was not any interest in a speciﬁed portion of the joint property, but the right of the judgment-debtor to have his share deﬁned and allotted by partition, and in this claim for general partition the question of thepious obligation of the sons to pay their father's debts would not at all arise. It was held, therefore, that theplaintiﬀ was legally entitled to 1 anna 4 pies share in the joint properties which the father himself could claim onpartition at the date of the sale.The sole point for our consideration is, whether the view taken by the learned Judges is right ? For a properdetermination of this point, it would be necessary to consider ﬁrst of all whether the sons of defendant No. 1 werelegally liable to pay the decretal debt due by their father and could this liability be enforced by attachment andsale of their undivided coparcenary interest in the joint family property along with that of their father ? If theliability did not exist, no other question would arise; but if it did exist, a question of procedure would still have tobe considered as to whether the sons' interest in the coparcenary 25 182 could be attached and sold withoutmaking the sons parties to the suit and the execution proceedings.So far as the ﬁrst point is concerned, the question whether the sons of defendant No. 1 were liable in law todischarge the decretal debt due by their father could be answered only with reference to the doctrine ofMitakshara law which imposes a duty upon the descendants of a person to pay the debts of their ancestorprovided they are not tainted with immorality. This doctrine, as is well known, has its origin in the conception ofSmriti writers who regard non-payment of debt as a positive sin, the evil consequences of which follow theundischarged debtor even in the after-world. It is for the purpose of rescuing the father from his torments in thenext world that an obligation is imposed upon the sons to pay their father's debts. The doctrine, as formulated inthe original texts, has indeed been modiﬁed in some respects by judicial decisions. Under the law, as it now stands,the obligation of the sons is not a personal obligation existing irrespective of the receipt of any assets; it is aliability conﬁned to the assets received by him in his share of the joint family property or to his interest in thesame. The obligation exists whether the sons are major or minor or whether the father is alive or dead. If the debtshave been contracted by the father and they are not immoral or irreligious, the interest of the sons in thecoparcenary property can always be made liable for such debts.We do not ﬁnd any warrant for the view that to saddle the sons with this pious obligation to pay the debts of theirfather, it is necessary that the father should be the manager or karta of the joint family, or that the family must becomposed of the father and his sons only and no other male member. No such limitation is deducible either fromthe original texts or the principles which have been engrafted upon the doctrine by judicial decisions. Where a debtis incurred for necessity or beneﬁt of the family, the manager, whether he be the father or not, has the undoubtedpower to alienate any portion of the coparcenary property for the satisfaction of such debts, irrespective of thefact as to who actually contracted the debts. The 183 authority of the manager is based upon the principle Ofagency or implied authority which has been formulated in a text quoted by Mitakshara. ""Even a single individual,""thus runs the text, ""may make a donation, mortgage or sale of immovable property during a season of distress, forthe sake of the family and especially for religious purposes""(1).Such family debt, however, stands on quite a diﬀerent footing from a personal debt contracted by the father whichdoes not beneﬁt the family. The liability of his sons to pay such debt does not rest on the principle indicated above,according to which the junior members of a family are made to pay the family debts. It is a special liability createdon purely religious grounds and can be enforced only against the sons of the father and no other coparcener. Theliability, therefore, has its basis entirely on the relationship between the father and the son. There is no authorityto show that it is in any way dependent upon the constitution of the family either at the time when the debt wascontracted or when the obligation is sought to be enforced. On the other hand, the subject of debts has been dealt.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/54.h/0209595895wwwiiofindirasee95tml36 9/12/2SIDHESHW AR MUKHERJEE V . BHUBNESHWAR PRASAD NARAINSINGH & ORS [13] INSC 54; AIR 13 SC 47; 14 SCR …with by the author of Mitakshara quite separately and it has apparently no connection with the provisions made bythe author relating to inheritance and constitution of the family.The learned Judges of the High Court laid great stress on the fact that the defendant No. 1 in the present case wasa junior member and not the karta of the family and consequently had no rights of disposal over his own interest orthe interest of his sons in the joint property. The idea seems to be that if the father was incompetent to alienatethe coparcenary rights of his sons for satisfaction of his own debts, the creditor of the father could not claim tooccupy a better position. This way of approach does not seem to us to be correct. It cannot be laid down as a pro-position of law that the creditor's power of proceeding against the son's share in the joint estate for recovery of thedebt due by the father is co-extensive with the father's power of disposal over such interest. As has (1) Mitak. 1. L,28, 184 been observed by this court in the case of Pannalal and Another v. Mst. Naraini(1) ""the father is power ofalienating the family property for payment of his just debts may be one of the consequences of the piousobligation which the Hindu law imposed upon the sons; or it may be one of the means of enforcing it, but it iscertainly not the measure of the entire obligation."" If the creditor's rights are deemed to be based exclusively uponthe father's power of disposition over the son's interest, such rights must necessarily come to an end as soon asthe father dies, or there is a partition between him and his sons. It is settled law that even after partition the sonscould be made liable for the pre-partition debts of the father if there was no proper arrangement for the paymentof such debts at the time when the partition was eﬀected, although the father could have no longer any right ofalienation in regard to the separated shares of the sons.It is true that under the Mitakshara law, as it is administered in the State of Bihar, no coparcener can alienate, evenfor valuable consideration, his undivided interest in the joint property without the consent of his coparceners; butalthough a coparcener is incompetent to alienate voluntarily his undivided coparcenary interest, it is open to thecreditor, who has obtained a decree against him personally, to attach and put up to sale his undivided interest, andafter purchase to have the interest separated by a suit for partition. A personal decree obtained against the sonscould certainly be executed against them by attachment and sale of their undivided interest. The position, in ouropinion, cannot be diﬀerent if they are under a legal liability to discharge the decretal debt due by their father; andthis liability must be capable of being enforced in the same manner as a personal decree against them. Whetherthis could be done only by making the sons parties to the sale or execution proceeding, is another matter to whichwe would advert presently; but so far as the legal liability of the sons is concerned, as the debts incurred by thefather have not been shown to be immoral or irreligious, it must be hold that tinder (2) [ 1952] INSC 13; [ 1952]S.C.R. 544 at 556, 185 the rule of Hindu law mentioned above, there is a legal liability on the part of the sons todischarge these debts and the creditor can enforce this liability by attachment and sale of the sons' interest in thesame manner as if it was a personal debt due by them. The fact that the father was not the karta or manager of thejoint family or that the family did consist of other coparceners besides the father and sons, does not aﬀect theliability of the sons in any way. This view has been taken in quite a number of cases(1) by the Allahabad as well asthe Madras High Courts, and in our opinion it is quite a sound view to take.Holding, as we do, that the sons were liable in this case to discharge the decretal debt due by their father, thefurther question arises as to how this liability could be enforced ? Could the interest of the sons in the jointproperty be attached and sold without making the sons parties to the suit and the execution proceedings? Thepoint does not seem to us to present much diﬃculty. Strictly speaking, the sons could not be said to be necessaryparties to the money suit which was instituted by the creditor against the father on the basis of a promissory note.If a decree was passed against the father and the sons jointly, the latter would have been personally liable for thedebt and the decree could have been executed against their separate or personal property as well. No doubt thesons could have been made parties to the suit in order that the question of their liability for the debts of theirfather might be decided in their presence. Be that as it may, the money decree passed against the father certainlycreated a debt payable by him.If the debt was not tainted with immorality, it was open to the creditor to realise the dues by attachment and saleof the sons' coparcenary interest in the joint property on the principles discussed above. As has been laid down bythe Judicial Committee in a series of cases, of which the case of Nanomi Babuasin v. Modun Mohun(2) may (1) VideLalta Prashad v, Gazadhar, 55 All. 28; Chhotey Lal v.

BHUBNESHWAR PRASAD NARAINSINGH & ORS [13] INSC 54; AIR 13 SC 47; 14 SCR …186 be taken as a type, the creditor has an option in such cases. He can, if he likes, proceed against the father'sinterest alone but he can, if he so chooses, put up to sale the sons' interest also and it is a question of fact, to bedetermined with reference to the circumstances of each individual case whether the smaller or the larger interestwas actually sold in execution. In the present case it has been found as a fact by the trial judge-and this ﬁnding hasnot been reversed in appeal -that the executing court intended to sell and did sell a four annas share in the jointproperty which included the undivided interest of the sons of defendant No. 1. According to the view taken by thePrivy Council in Nanomi Babuasin's case(1), all that the son can claim in such cases is that not being made party tothe sale or execution proceeding, he ought not to be barred from trying the nature of the debt or his liability to paythe same in any suit or proceeding started by him or to which he might be made a party. He could raise the pointeither by way of objection in the execution proceeding itself or he could himself ﬁle a suit for a declaration that thedebt was not binding on him. He could also raise it by way of defence when the auction purchaser seeks to have hisrights deﬁned and demarcated in a partition suit. In the case before us, the sons, who were made defendants tothe partition suit, had that opportunity given to them. Unfor- tunately, however, they did not choose to availthemselves of this opportunity. Defendant No. 2, the major son of defendant No. 1, did not ﬁle any writtenstatement or contest the suit at all. A written statement was indeed ﬁled on behalf of the minor sons, defendants 3and 4, who were represented by a pleader guardian and there this point was speciﬁcally raised. But it appears fromthe records that they did not invite the court to frame any issue on the point, nor did they lead any evidence uponit. They failed to show, therefore, that the debt was one which they were not obliged to pay under the rule ofHindu law. It may be further noted that although the trial court's decision was against the sons, they did notchoose to challenge the decree by way of an appeal. The appeal was ﬁled only by their (1) 13 I.A.187 father and they were made respondents; and it was only at a very late stage that the appellate courttransferred them to the category of appellants. The learned Judges of the High Court seem to be of the opinionthat the principle enunciated by the Judicial Committee in Nanomi Babuasin's case(1) or the other cases thatfollowed it could apply only when the father was the head of the family and in that capacity could represent hissons in the suit or the execution proceeding. But if the father was not the karta, this principle, it is said, would notapply and the purchaser could only acquire the right, title and interest of the father alone even though the courtpurported to sell the interest of the sons as well. This does not seem to us to be a sound view to take. It is true thatin all the cases referred to above, the father was actually the head of the family but that does not make anydiﬀerence in principle. If the diﬀerence is sought to be made on the basis of the father's capacity to represent thesons in any litigation, it may be said that, subject to the rights of the sons to assert and prove that the debtcontracted by their father was not such as would be binding on them under the rule of Hindu law, the father even ifhe was not a karta, could represent the sons as eﬀectively in the sale or execution proceedings as he could do if hewas the karta himself. Without being a karta he could, as a father, completely represent his branch of thecoparceners consisting of himself and his sons; and vis-a-vis his sons his position would not improve in any way byhis being a karta of the family. It has been observed in a Madras case(1) and we think rightly that so long as thefamily remains joint, all the members of a branch or a sub-branch of the family can form a distinct and separatecorporate unit within the larger unit. Of such a smaller unit consisting of the father and his sons, the father wouldundoubtedly be the head and legal representative, although he is not the head of the larger unit. In our opinion,therefore, the High Court was not right in holding that the plaintiﬀ could not claim 4 annas share in the propertyon (1) 13 I.A 1.(2) Vide Sudarsaram v. Narasimhulu, I.L.R. 25 Mad. 149, 155, 188 the strength of the purchase by his predecessor inthe execution sale simply because the father was not the manager or karta of the joint family at that time. Theresult is that this appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trialjudge restored. The plaintiﬀ will have costs of this court as well as of the court below.Civil Appeals Nos. 54 and 55 of 1951.Coming now to the money appeals, the point for consideration is a short one. The suits out of which these appealsarise were instituted by the plaintiﬀ in the partition suit against the ﬁrst party defendants for recovery of his 4annas share of the income or proﬁts of the properties speciﬁed in the schedules to the plaints and which wereincluded admittedly in his purchase, on the allegation that the defendants ﬁrst party appropriated the entireproﬁts to themselves and refused to give the plaintiﬀ his legitimate share. The High Court has held that this claimof the plaintiﬀ must fail. All that he purchased at the execution sale was the undivided interest of the coparcenersin the joint property. He did not acquire title to any deﬁned share in the property and was not entitled to jointpossession from the date of his purchase. He could work out his rights only by a suit for partition and his right topossession would date from the period when a speciﬁc allotment was made in his favour. In our opinion, this is the.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/13/54.h/0209595895wwwiiofindirasee95tml56 9/12/2SIDHESHW AR MUKHERJEE V .

With great respect again, thisanalogy is not very happy or apposite. Under Order XXI, rule 63, it is only the attaching creditor who has the rightto ﬁle a suit or of being impleaded as defendant in a suit by the judgment- debtor. AR the creditors of thejudgment debtor who have not attached the property are not necessary parties in a suit under Order XXI, rule 63,though after the decision in that suit they may be entitled to share in the rateable distribution of the property ifthey make an application for that purpose. In a way it is true to say that in all suits by a creditor against a debtorwhere the debtor owes to a number of creditors, every other creditor is interested in seeing that that creditor's suitis dismissed or his debt is considerably cut down; but from that it does not follow that in a suit on a promissorynote by a creditor against the debtor all the other creditors are necessary parties. The eventual interest of a partyin the fruits of a litigation cannot be hold to be the true test of impleading parties under the Code of CivilProcedure and it is rather diﬃcult to hold that where that is not the true test under the Code, that should beadopted as A test in proceedings of an administrative 522 character under the U. P. Encumbered Estates Act. itcannot be forgotten that under the provisions of section 11 no provision has been made for issuing notice to all thecreditors. Reference may also be made to rule 6 framed under the Encumbered Estates Act. This rule provides thatthe proceedings under this Act shall be governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as they are applicable. Asalready pointed out, the provisions of Order 1, rules 1 and 3, cannot aptly be held applicable in such proceedings.We cannot uphold the view of Pathak J. that all creditors become parties to the proceedings under the Act in thetechnical sense of the term after a notice has been served upon them and in any event after they have ﬁled thewritten statements, that they continue to remain' as parties until the debts are liquidated or proceedingsterminated in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This seems to be too wide a statement of the law on thepoint. Can it be said that after each individual creditor obtains a decree in respect of his claim under section 14,each one of these creditors has to be impleaded as a party in an appeal preferred by that creditor or by the debtor.It is not possible to give an answer in the aﬃrmative to such proposition. no hesitation in saying that though heultimately abondoned n thinking that in. We have therefore Mr. Justice Braund, his view, was right administrativeproceedings technical rules of the First Schedule of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding impleading of partiesshould not be invoked and that the matter should be viewed in a more liberal way, regard always being had to thefact that there is no collusion between the debtor and the claimant and that there are persons who are bona ﬁdelitigating in respect of the title of the claimant under section 11, and if there has been such a bona ﬁde ﬁght whichresults in a decree in an appeal against that decree it is suﬃcient that those who took an active part in theproceedings under section II are impleaded. It is not necessary to implead each and every creditor who either didpot appear or put forward a written statement under 523 section 10 or took no active part in the proceedings undersection 11(2). In the view that we have taken it is not necessary to decide the question whether the High Court wasright in not exercising its powers under Order XLI, rule 20, in impleading the creditors as respondents to theappeal.For the reasons given above we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and remand the caseto that court for hearing the appeal in accordance with law on its merits.

October 8. The Judgment of the Court was delivered byMAHAJANN J .507 MAHAJAN J.-This appeal is before us on a certiﬁcate granted by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabadunder section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the only point it raises is whether the appeal preferred by theappellant to the High Court was imperfectly constituted, inasmuch as all the creditors were not impleaded asparties to that appeal.The facts are that on the 28th October, 1936, Rama Krishna Narain and others submitted an application undersection 4 of the U. P. Encumbered Estates Act, 1934, to the sub- divisional oﬃcer, Tilhar, Shahjahanpur, prayingthat the provisions of the -said Act be applied to them. This application was eventually transferred by the sub-divisional oﬃcer to the court of the special judge, ﬁrst grade, Shahjahanpur. The landlords on 26th August, 1938,www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/55.html/020959529509518 9/12/2DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, HARDOI V . RAMA KRISHNA NARAIN & ORS [13] INSC 55; AIR 13 SC 51; 14 SCR 56 (8 Oc…submitted a written statement to the special judge under section 8 of the Act and therein stated inter alia thatthey had a pro- prietary interest to the extent of ten annas share in 52 items of taluqdari villages which formed partof taluka Bharawan. A notice of this application was published as required by section 11(1) of the Act in the U.P.Gazette dated 13th May, 1939. On 30th November, 1939, Raja Dev Singh, who subsequently became a ward of theCourt of Wards, ﬁled a claim petition under section 11(2) of the Act and alleged therein that he was the proprietorof 6 1/2 pies share in 47 items of property mentioned in schedule (A)- of the landlords' written statement. Thisclaim was.disallowed by the special judge by an order dated 24th August, 1940, and it was held that Raja Dev Singh was notthe owner of the property claimed by him in his objection petition. The Deputy Commissioner of Hardoi who is theCourt of Wards of Bharawan estate ﬁled an appeal against this decision of the special judge to the High Court. Allthe applicant-landlords were impleaded as respondents in the appeal along with the Unao Commercial Bank Ltd.,one of the creditors who had taken part in the proceedings before the special judge at that stage. It does notappear from the record that the other creditors had either ﬁled written statements 67 508 under section 10 or hadmade any allegation that the landlords had secreted any property. Their names were not mentioned in thememorandum of parties annexed to the memo of costs, and in these circumstances they were not impleaded asrespondents in the appeal. Subsequently the appellant made an application for impleading them as respondents inthe appeal and prayed that he be given the beneﬁt of section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act. This application wasrejected, and eventually the appeal was dismissed on the ground that it was. defective and could not beentertained in the absence of all the creditors as respondents in the appeal. The, cross-objection ﬁled by the UnaoCommercial Bank with respect to costs was allowed.The appellant on 21st November, 1944, ﬁled a petition for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council. It was allegedin this application that the valuation of the subject-matter of the appeal in the trial court in the High Court andbefore His Majesty in Council was over Rs. 10,000 and that though in the result the judgment and decree of theHigh Court aﬃrmed the judgment and decree of the trial court , a substantial question of law aﬀecting not only theparties but of general interest was involved. The High Court with- out deciding whether the appeal raised asubstantial question of law granted leave to the appellant under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure on theground that the judgment of the High Court being -one of variance, and the value of the subject.-matter in disputein the trial court as well as in the appeal to His Majesty in Council being over Rs. 10,000, the case fulﬁlled therequirements of that section.Mr. Srivastava who represented the debtors-landlords before us raised a preliminary objection that the certiﬁcateunder section 110 of the Civil Procedure Code was defective and the appeal was thus incompetent and could notbe entertained by us. He contended that the only variation made by the High Court in the judgment of the trialjudge was in respect of costs and such a variation in the matter of costs only did not invoice the decree a decree ofvariance, and that 509 being. so, the ground on which the High Court had granted the certiﬁcate was erroneousand the certiﬁcate being defective this appeal could not be heard. In our opinion, this contention is without force.It is no doubt true that costs are not taken into consideration and are treated as extraneous to the subjectmatter ofa suit, and variation in the matter of costs does not make the decree of the appellate court a decree of variance;but as already stated, the appellant did not pray for the certiﬁcate on that ground. He had expressly alleged thatthe decree being one of aﬃrmance he was entitled to a certiﬁcate, because the subject of the suit as well as of theappeal was a sum of orver Rs. 10,000 and the case involveda4 substantial question of law. It is obvious that theground on which the appeal was dismissed by the High Court raises a question of law of importance to the partiesand that being so, on that ground alone the appellant was entitled to a certiﬁcate under section I 10, CivilProcedure Code. The certiﬁcate therefore is good, though the -around on which it was granted is erroneous. It isalways open to an appellant to support the certiﬁcate on grounds other than those, on which it has been actuallyordered to be given. The preliminary objection therefore fails.In order to determine whether the creditors are necessary parties in proceedings under chapters 3 and 4 of the U.P.Encumbered Estates Act, 1934, it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act. The law was enactedfor giving relief to encumbered estates in U. P. Section 4 provides that any landlord, who is subject to or whoseimmoveable property or any part thereof is encumbered with private debts, may make an application in writing tothe Collector of the district, stating the amount of such private debts and also of his public debts both decreed andundecreed and requesting that the provisions of this Act be applied to him.. The section gives an option to thelandlord who is subject to private debts to make an application for obtaining relief under the provisions of the Act.The Collector then transmits the application to the special judge appointed under the Act.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/55.html/020959529509528 9/12/2DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, HARDOI V . RAMA KRISHNA NARAIN & ORS [13] INSC 55; AIR 13 SC 51; 14 SCR 56 (8 Oc…510 The direct consequence of the acceptance of such an application by the collector is that the creditors aredeprived of their rights of proceeding against such a landlord in civil or revenue courts in respect of their debts andall attachments made in execution of decrees become null and void and no process in execution can issue afterthat date. The provisions of the Act are clearly detrimental to the contractual rights of the creditors and to theirremedies in civil law and such a statute can by no stretch of imagination be described to have been enacted for thebeneﬁt of creditors. Section 8 of the Act confers power on the special judge of calling upon the applicant to submitto him within a period to be ﬁxed -by him in this behalf, a written statement containing full particulars respectingthe public and private debts to which he is subject or with which his immoveable property is encumbered;of the nature and extent of his proprietary rights in land;of the nature and extent of his property which is liable to attachment and sale; and lastly, of the names andaddresses of the creditors, so far as can be ascertained by him. If the applicant fails to submit a written statementas called for or furnish the information referred to in the proviso to sub-section (2), the special judge is empoweredto dismiss the application. The landlord is not required to implead any creditors as party respondents in his writtenstatement, but he has to furnish information, regarding the names and addresses of his creditors so far as they areknown to or can be ascertained by him and his failure to give information may result in a dismissal of theapplication.Section 9 requires the special judge to publish in the oﬃcial gazette a notice in English calling upon all personshaving claims in respect of private debts both decreed and undecreed against the person or the property of thelandlord to present to the special judge within three months from the date of the publication of the notice, awritten statement of their claims. He is also required to cause copies of such notice to be published in such paperor papers as he may direct and to exhibit it at his own oﬃce, at the oﬃce of the collector and at some 511conspicuous place where the landlord resides. He is further directed to send a copy of the notice and a copy of thewritten statement under sub-section (1) of section 8 by registered post to each of the creditors whose names andaddresses are mentioned in the statement under clause,(d) of sub-section (1) of section 8. Section 10 provides thatevery claimant referred to in section 9 shall in the written statement of his claim give full particulars thereof andshall state so far as - they are known to or can be ascertained by him, the nature and extent of the landlord'sproprietary rights in the land and the nature and extent of the landlord's property other than proprietary rights inland. The provisions of this section not only require a creditor to give particulars of his own debt but also give himopportunity to contend that the landlord has secreted some property. Section 11 (1) of the AA directs the specialjudge to publish a notice specifying the property mentioned by the applicant under section 8 or by any claimantunder section 10. The object of the provisions made in section 11 (1) is to ﬁnd out the extent of the property thatcan be utilized to-wards liquidation of the debts ascertained under the subsequent provisions of the Act. Section11 (2) provides as follows:- Any person having any claim to the property mentioned in such notice shall, within aperiod of three months, from the date of the publication of the notice in the oﬃcial gazette make an application tothe special judge stating his claim and the special judge shall determine whether the property speciﬁed in theclaim, or any part thereof is liable to attachment sale or mortgage in satisfaction of the debts of the applicant.""Sub-section (3) directs the special judge to determine such claims before he proceeds to determine the amountdue to any creditor under section 14. He is further directed not to pass any decree under section 14 until the expiryof a period of one month from the last day on which he determines a claim under section 11. Sub-section (4) oﬀsection 11 provides that any order passed by the special judge under this section shall be 512 deemed to be adecree of a civil court of competent jurisdiction. Section 13 enacts that every claim, decreed or undecreed againstthe landlord shall, unless made within the time prescribed be deemed for ;III purposes and on all occasions to havebeen duly discharged. Section 14 lays down the procedure for determination of the amount of debts.The judge is directed to give notice of the date of enquiring into the claims of the creditors to the diﬀerentclaimants and to the person who has made the application under ,section 4. He is directed to examine each claimafter hearing all such parties as desire to be heard and after considering the evidence, if any, produced by them.The section lays down them mode of calculating interest on the amount of such claims and provides for theapplication of the provisions of the Usurious Loans Act to the proceedings under the Act. Sub-section (7), providesas follows:---- ""If the special judge ﬁnds that any amount is due to the claimant be shall pass a simple moneydecree for such amount together with any costs which he may allow in respect of proceedings in his court and ofproceedings in any civil court stayed under the provisions of this Act, together with pendente lite and futureinterest at a rate not greater than the rate speciﬁed in section 27 and if he ﬁnds that no amount is due, he may passa decree for costs in favour of the landlord. Such decree shall be deemed to be a decree of a' civil court ofcompetent jurisdiction but no decree against the landlord shall be executable within the United Provinces exceptwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/55.html/020959529509538 9/12/2DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, HARDOI V . RAMA KRISHNA NARAIN & ORS [13] INSC 55; AIR 13 SC 51; 14 SCR 56 (8 Oc…under the provisions of this Act."" Section 18 provides that subject to the right of appeal or revision, the eﬀect of adecree of the special judge under sub- section (7) of section 14 shall be to extinguish the previously existing rights,if any, of the claimant, together with all rights, if any, of mortgage or lien by which the same are secured and,where any decree is given by the special judge to substitute for those rights a right to recover the amount of thedecree in the manner and to the extent speciﬁed in the Act. Section 45 provides for appeals and revisions againstorders and decrees of the special judge.513 It is apparent from the provisions of the Act cited above that the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act is no more, norless than, a code for the administration of the assets of the landlord-debtor and for giving relief to him in a numberof ways against the contractual rights of his creditors. It clearly deprives the creditors of any remedies that theywould ordinarily have in ordinary civil courts and extinguishes the mortgages held by them. Sectional(2) deals withclaims of third parties to the property alleged by the landlord as belonging to him and the judge is required todetermine whether such property is liable to attachment or sale. It is noteworthy that under section 14(1) thespecial judge is directed to follow a certain procedure, but no such procedure is prescribed under section 1 1(2). Insection 14 he is required to ﬁx a date and to give notice of the date of inquiring into the claims of the creditors toall the claimants. There is no such parallel requirement in respect of claims of third parties under section 11(2),though as a matter of practice similar procedure is also followed in an enquiry under this section.The question that requires consideration in these circumstances is -whether the rules of the ﬁrst schedule to theCode of Civil Procedure should be rigorously applied to proceedings under the Encumbered Estates Act, andwhether the creditors who are no doubt' .persons interested in those proceedings and who would ultimately beentitled to recover their decretal debts from the property the extent of which falls for determination in an enquiryunder section II, are necessary parties in the enquiry, or are merely proper parties thereto and as such entitled onlyto notice of the proceedings. Order 1, Rules I and 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, provide in regard to the personswho are to be joined as plaintiﬀs or those who have to be joined as defendants in suits. Rule 1 is in these terms:-""All persons may be joined in one suit as plaintiﬀ, in whom any right to relief in respect of or arising of the same actor transaction or series of act transactions is alleged to exist, whether 514 severally or in the alternative, where, ifsuch persons brought separate suits, any common question of law or fact would arise."" Rule 3-provides:- "" Allpersons may be joined as defendants against whom any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same act ortransaction or series of acts or transactions is alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally or in the alternative,where, if separate suits were brought aaainst such persons any common question of law or fact would arise."" It isapparent that strictly speaking the provisions of these rules cannot be applied to the proceedings contemplated bythe U. P. Encumbered Estates Act. These proceedings cannot be. described as suits. It was conceded at the Barthat an inquiry into third party claims under section 11(2) cannot be described as a suit. Neither section 8 norsection 1 1 provides that the creditors have to be impleaded as parties respondents in such an objectionapplication. As already said, the section provides that the applicant has to give information about the names of thecreditors and the amounts due to them. Till the time that a decree is passed under section 14 in favour of any ofthe creditors it cannot be, said that any one of them is entitled to share in the property of the debtor. It is onlywhen a claim has been made under section 10 by a creditor and it has ripened into a decree that he is entitled toshare in the assets of the landlord. But if he commits a default in submitting a written statement of the claimunder section 10, the claim stands discharged under section 13.In this particular case it is not clear whether any of the creditors except the Unao Commercial Bank had made aclaim under section 10. It is also -not clear whether any decree under section 14 has been passed in favour of any ofthe creditors. An inquiry for the determination of the quantum of the debts of the landlord can only be made afterthird party claims have been settled under the provisions of section 11(2). In view of these provisions it seemsdiﬃcult to hold that the technical and 515 strict rules as to impleading of parties can have appli- cation toproceedings under section 11 of the U.P.Encumbered Estates Act. It is true that the creditors must be given notice and opportunity to say whether thelandlord has secreted any property, but if they do not do so and are content with the disclosures made by thelandlord they cannot be said to have any further interest in the quantum of the property which the landlord hasmentioned under the provisions of section 8 in his written statement. In that situation, if a third party claims anyitem of property mentioned by the landlord in the written statement, the controversy at that stage lies onlybetween the landlord and the claimant, though in the result the creditors may either be beneﬁted or deprived ofsome of the 'assets which the landlord discloses in the application as liable to attachment and sale towardspayment of decrees that may be passed in favour of the creditors.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/55.html/020959529509548 9/12/2DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, HARDOI V . RAMA KRISHNA NARAIN & ORS [13] INSC 55; AIR 13 SC 51; 14 SCR 56 (8 Oc…It can well be assumed that the ﬁght at that stage being a bona ﬁde ﬁght between the objector and the landlord,the interests of the creditors will be fully represented by the landlord and any decision obtained in his favour oragainst him would be binding on all the creditors on the principles enacted in explanation 6 to section I 1, CivilProcedure Code. If, therefore, in such a contest the claimant loses and the landlord succeeds, then in an appealagainst that decision he need only implead the landlord as a party respondent and it is not necessary to implead allthe creditors as respondents merely on the ground that ultimately they would be aﬀected by-the result, either totheir beneﬁt or to their detriment. The court has power, if it considers that the presence of the creditors isnecessary at the hearing, to give them notice of the appeal so that they may have the opportunity of placing theircon- tentions before it. The observance of such a procedure may well conduce to a fair hearing of the appeal, evenif the creditors have raised no plea of any kind before the special judge. In a case, however, where the creditorsraise a plea that the landlord has secreted certain property and it should be included in the schedule and suchproperty is then claimed by a third 516 party, they may well be regarded as real parties to the controversy andfailure to implead them may result in the appeal being imperfectly constituted. In the situation that arises in thepresent case the appeal should have been held to be properly constituted because all those who raised anycontroversy whatsoever as to the ownership of the property in dispute were impleaded.We are fully conscious of the fact that the view that we have expressed above is not in conformity with a numberof decisions of the Oudh Chief Court and the Allahabad High Court. It is therefore necessary to examine thosedecisions in order to see whether the reasons given therein are sound or erroneous.In Rameshwar v. Ajodhia Prasad(1) a Bench of the Oudh Court held that all the creditors who were impleaded asparties to the application under the Act are necessary parties to an appeal by the objector against an adverse orderpassed against him under section 11. -This judgment proceeds on the assumption that all the creditors havingbeen impleaded as parties to the application and not having been made respondents in the appeal, the appealbecame imperfectly constituted. In this case the question whether under the provisions of the EncumberedEstates Act an applicant is required to implead creditors as parties to the application was neither argued norconsidered; on the other hand, it was assumed that all the creditors have to be impleaded as parties in theapplication made by the claimants under the Act. That assumption is, of course, erroneous. Under section 4 theapplicant is entitled to request the collector, that the provisions of the Act be applied to him and relief given to himunder its provisions. He is not required even to give information about the names and addresses of creditors andno question of impleading anyone as a respondent arises at that stage. When the collector has forwarded thisapplication to the special judge, then the special judge is empowered to call upon the applicant to ﬁle a writtenstatement and therein he is bound %to give information About the (1) A.I.R. 1941 Oudh 580, 517 names andaddresses of his creditors so far as they are known to him or can be ascertained by him. In the written statementwhich he is called upon to ﬁle on a requisition by the special judge he is not called upon to implead any persons asparties, in the sense in which that term is used in the Code of Civil Procedure. This decision therefore is not of anyhelp on the point that was argued before us.In Chaudhri Bishunath Prasad v. Sarju Saran Tewari(1), another Bench of the Oudh Court held that an enquiry intothe indebtedness of the landlord is to be carried out by the special judge in the presence of all the creditors, thatthough it is true that each creditor is interested in establishing his own debt against the landlord, he is furtherinterested that the landlord should not be allowed to withhold any property from the court, and that if 'a claimantunder section I I sets up a title to the property shown by the landlord to belong to him, although the real contestmay for the time being be between the claimant on the one hand and the landlord on the other hand, it is to theultimate interest of the entire body of the creditors that the property should be held to belong to the landlord, andif the decision is in favour of the landlord, all the creditors will be entitled to have their debts satisﬁed out of suchproperty; but if, however, the decision is against them, the property will go out of the reach of the creditors andwill not be available to them for the satisfaction of their debts. It was further held that as all. the creditors had notbeen joined as parties to the appeal and as they were interested in the result of the appeal, it could not be heldthat they were wholly unconcerned in the result of the case and therefore the appeal was not maintainable. Itseems to us that in making these observations the learned Judges did not clearly bear in mind the distinctionsbetween the provisions of sections 11 and 14 of the Act. Section 14 lays down a deﬁnite procedure so far as theenquiry into the claims of creditors is concerned . Each creditor has to establish his claim against the landlord as he(1) A.I.R. 1942 Oudh 16.518 would do if he had ﬁled a suit against him. This enquiry is made after the quantum of the property of thedebtor has been ascertained under section 11. As already pointed out, if any creditor raises any dispute as to thequantum of the property as he is entitled to raise such a dispute in his written statement ﬁled under section 10, inwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/55.html/020959529509558 9/12/2DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, HARDOI V . RAMA KRISHNA NARAIN & ORS [13] INSC 55; AIR 13 SC 51; 14 SCR 56 (8 Oc…that situation it may well be held that such a creditor is directly interested in the enquiry under section 11 ; but it isdiﬃcult to see that all other creditors who have accepted the list of property ﬁled by the debtor as true are directlyinterested in the enquiry under that section and are as such necessary parties and that without impleading themthe enquiry cannot proceed. Rules I and 3 of Schedule I Of the Code of Civil Procedure do not lay down that everyperson who is ultimately interested in the result of a suit should be impleaded as a defendant. All that these rulesinsist upon is that all persons should be joined as defendants against whom any right to relief is alleged to exist,provided that such right arises in respect of the same act or transaction or series of acts or transactions and thecase is one where common question of law or fact would arise. It is not possible to hold that the objector can claimany right to relief against the creditors as such.The right to relief in the enquiry under section 11 is only against the landlord who alleges himself to be the ownerof the property which the claimant says belongs to him, and creditors have no right of interest in the propertyclaimed by the objector. The test of ultimate beneﬁt therefore laid down by the Oudh Court for holding that allcreditors are necessary parties in the enquiry under section 11 of the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act does not fulﬁlthe conditions laid down in the Code for impleading parties as plaintiﬀs or as defendants. If they are not necessaryparties in the true sense of the term in the enquiry under section 11, a fortiori failure to implead them asrespondents in the appeal detective.In Lakshmi Narain v. Satgurnath(1) another Bench of the Oudh Court took the' same view. In this case.(1) A.I.R. 1942 Oudh 339.519 the earlier decisions of the Oudh Court were followed The view was reiterated that creditors are parties in theproceedings under the Encumbered Estates Act.In Benares Bank Ltd., Benares v. Bhagwandas (1), a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court considered thisquestion and expressed the same opinion as had been expressed in the Oudh decisions referred to above. Mr.Justice Braund, who was one of the Judges constituting the Full Bench, with great reluctance shared the opinion ofthe majority merely out of respect for the opinion of Pathak J. and it appears that, left to himself, he would haveheld otherwise. The majority judgment was delivered by Pathak J. He enunciated two tests for deciding whether acertain person was a necessary party in a proceeding: (1) that there must be a right to some relief against suchparty in respect of the matter involved in the proceedings in question, and (2) it should not be possible to pass aneﬀective decree in the absence of such party, and proceeded to observe that the creditors of a landlord who haveclaimed relief under the Encumbered Estates Act are necessary parties to the proceedings under that Act and thatthe object of the Act is to compel the landlord to surrender his entire property for the beneﬁt of his creditors andto liquidate the debts of all the creditors in accordance with and to the extent per- mitted by the Act. There can beno question that these are the true tests for determining whether a person is a necessary party to certainproceedings but the question is whether judged on these tests the creditors of a landlord under the U. P.Encumbered Estates Act can be said to be necessary parties in an enquiry under section 11. It seems to us that inthe ﬁrst instance it is an incorrect assumption to make that the object of the Act is to grant relief to the creditors ofa landlord; it is quite the converse. The object of the Act is to grant relief to the landlord whose estate isencumbered with debts, by scaling, down the debts and by depriving the creditors of their (1) A.I.R. 1947 All. 18.520 civil remedies. The creditors are allowed to prove their debts and obtain decrees from the special judgeaccording to the provisions of and to the extent allowed by the Act and they lose all their rights on securities heldby them.Coming to the application of the tests laid down by the learned Judge, it is not possible to hold that any right ofrelief exists in an objector under section 11 as against the creditors. It is also diﬃcult to see how an eﬀective decreecannot be passed as regards title to the property in the absence of creditors. One test of the eﬀectiveness of adecree is whether that decree can be executed without the presence of creditors as regards property decreed infavour of a claimant. It is obvious that in execution proceedings a warrant of attachment and for delivery ofpossession can only be issued against the owner, viz., the landlord, and not against the creditors. In theseproceedings the special judge can give no relief to the objector against the creditors. So on the tests mentioned bythe learned Judge it is clear that the creditors of a debtor are not necessary parties in these administrativeproceedings under the Encumbered Estates Act, though they may be given notice of those proceedings andaﬀorded opportunity to watch those proceedings in order to see that no property is secreted from them and it ispreserved for satisfaction of decrees that may eventually be passed in their favour.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/55.html/020959529509568 9/12/2DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, HARDOI V . RAMA KRISHNA NARAIN & ORS [13] INSC 55; AIR 13 SC 51; 14 SCR 56 (8 Oc…In his judgment Pathak J. proceeded to observe that though the landlord is a, party to the dispute under section11, it is obvious that the main party who is vitally interested in that dispute is the entire body of creditors, becausethe issue that arises out of such a -claim is whether the property which is the subject matter of the claim is liablefor the satisfaction of the debts due to the entire body of creditors. This statement also, in our opinion is not veryprecise. It is not correct to say that the result of a decision,in such a claim makes the property liable for satisfactionof debts due to the entire body of creditors who had made claims at that stage. The property is only 521 liable forsatisfaction of decrees that may be passed subsequently under section 14. It may well be that of the persons whohave been disclosed as creditor under section 8, a number of them may not at all be interested in the result of thedecision of the claim under section II. It is an overstatement to make that the main party who is vitally interested inthe dispute is the entire body of creditors '.The dispute relates to title to property and according to all principles of impleading of parties it is not the eventualbeneﬁt that a person may derive from a certain decision that is the crucial test in deciding whether a party is anecessary party or merely a proper party.

JEEWANLAL LTD. [1953] INSC 59; AIR 1953 SC 473; 1954 SCR 0 (8 Oct…The relevant facts which are not in dispute are these: The respondent company is a company incorporated in whatwas then British India having a capital of Rs. 3,600,000 divided into 360,000 shares of Rs. 10 each. The AluminiumLimited, a company incorporated in Canada, held 359,790 shares in the chargeable accounting periods ending onDecember31, 1939, and December 31, 1940, and 359,600 shares in the chargeable accounting periods ending onDecember 31, 1941, December 31, 1942, and December 31, 1943. In exercise of the power given to it by article 105of the articles of association of the respondent company, the Aluminium Ltd. appointed three permanent directorson the board of directors of the respondent company. Two of these directors eventually retired and only one,namely, Mr. L. G. Bash continued to be a director of the respondent company nominated by the Aluminium Ltd.Mr. L. G. Bash and the other directors had between them during the chargeable 191 accounting periods ending onDecember 31, 1939, and December 31, 1940, only 210 shares and in the chargeable accounting periods ending onDecember 31, 1941, December 31, 1942, and December 31, 1943, 400 shares, Mr. L. G. Bash not having a singleshare during these last mentioned chargeable accounting periods. By a resolution passed by the directors of theAluminium Ltd., Mr. L. G. Bash was appointed to vote and/or from time to time to appoint a special or generalproxy to vote for and on behalf of the Aluminium Ltd. in respect of the shares held by it in the respondentcompany at all ordinary or extraordinary general meetings of the shareholders of the respondent company. Article90 of the articles of association of the respondent company provides:- ""90. Where a company registered under theprovisions of the Indian Companies Act or not is a member of this company a person duly appointed to representsuch company at a meeting of this company in accordance with the provisions of section 80 of the IndianCompanies Act, 1913, shall not be deemed to be a proxy but shall be entitled to vote for such company on a showof hands -and to exercise the same power on behalf of the company which he represents as if he were an individualmember of this company including the power to appoint a proxy whether special or general and the production atthe meeting of a company of such resolution appointing such representative duly signed by one director of suchcompany and by the secretary (if any) and certiﬁed by them or him as being a true copy of the resolution shall onproduction at the meeting be accepted by this company as suﬃcient evidence of the validity of his appointment.""Mr. L. G. Bash has at all material times been exercising the powers conferred by the above article as therepresentative of the Aluminium Ltd.The claim of the respondent company was that it should be regarded as a company the directors whereof had acontrolling interest therein, inasmuch as Mr. L. G. Bash, one of the directors, had the I authority to exercise thevoting power of the Aluminium Ltd. and, 192 as such, could control the aﬀairs of the respondent company and thatin computing the standard proﬁts the statutory percentage should be taken at 10 per cent. per annum and not at 8per cent per annum. This contention was rejected by the Excess Proﬁts Tax Oﬃcer. On appeal by the respondentcompany the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Excess Proﬁts Tax upheld the decision of the Excess Proﬁts TaxOﬃcer. The respondent company thereupon appealed to the Incometax Appellate Tribunal ""which reversed thedecision of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner observing that in view of the power of attorney that was givento Mr. L. G. Bash by the Aluminium Ltd. there was no room for doubt that the respondent company, which wasthen the appellant before the Tribunal, was a director-controlled company. On the application of theCommissioner of Income-tax, the Appellate Tribunal referred the question of law herein before set out.By its judgment dated the 11th January, 1951, the High Court of Calcutta has answered the question in theaﬃrmative.The Commissioner of Excess Proﬁts Tax, West Bengal, has now come up on appeal to this court with a certiﬁcateunder section 66-A (2) of the Indian Income-tax Act.In common parlance a person is said to have ""a controlling interest"" in a company when such a person acquires, bypurchase or otherwise, the majority of the vote-carrying shares in that company, for the control of the companyresides in the voting powers of its shareholders. In this sense, the directors of a company may well be regarded ashaving ""a controlling interest"" in the company when they hold and are entered in the share register as holders ofthe majority of the shares which, under the articles of association of the company, carry the right to vote. [ SeeGlasgow Expanded Metal Co., Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1) and Commissioners of Inland Revenuev. B. W.Noble(2)]. It is not, however, necessary that in order to have ""a Controlling interest"" the person or persons whohold the majority of the votecarrying shares must have a beneﬁcial interest in the (1) (1923) 12 Tax Cas. 573.(2) (1926) 12 Tax Cas, 911.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/59.html2/4 9/12/2020COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, WEST BENGAL V. JEEWANLAL LTD. [1953] INSC 59; AIR 1953 SC 473; 1954 SCR 0 (8 Oct…193 shares held by them. These persons may hold the shares as trustees and may even be accountable to theirbeneﬁciaries and may be brought to book for exercising their votes in breach of trust, nevertheless, as betweenthem as shareholders and the company, they are the shareholders, and as such, have ""a controlling interest"" in thecompany. [ See Inland Revenue Commissioners v. J. Bibby & Sons Ltd.(1) and Commissioner of Income-tax v. BipinSilk Mills Ltd. (2)].According to the facts found in the statement of the case the directors of the respondent company do notthemselves hold the majority of shares which, on the contrary, are registered in the name of the Aluminium Ltd.and, therefore, according to the principles discussed above, they cannot be said to have ""a controlling interest"" inthe respondent company.Learned counsel for the respondent company, however, contends, on the analogy of the reasonings adopted bythe House of Lords in British American Tobacco Co. Ltd. v.Commissioners of Inland Revenue(3) that although Mr. L. G.Bash does not hold the majority of shares and has no beneﬁcial interest in the shares held by the Aluminium Ltd.in the respondent company and although he may be bound to cast the votes according to the directions of hisprincipals, the Aluminium Ltd., and may be answerable to the latter if he acts in breach of his duty, nevertheless,as long as his authority is not revoked, as far as the respondent company is concerned, tile, majority of its vote-carrying shares are subject, directly or indirectly, to his will and ordering and, therefore, the directors of therespondent company in fact control its aﬀairs at general meetings and as such have "" a controlling interest ""therein, no matter by what machinery or means that result has been eﬀected. This line of argument found favourwith the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court. We are unable, with all respect, to accept this argument as sound,for this argument appears to us to oversimplify the position.Assuming, but without, expressing any ﬁnal opinion as (1) [ 1946]Cas. 167, (2) A.I.R. 1947 Bom. 45; 14 I.T.R. 344. 14 I.T.R. (Suppl.) 7; [ 1945] I All E.R. 667; 29 Tax(3) [ 1943] A.C. 335; 11 I.T.R. (Suppl.) 29; 29 Tax Cas. 49, 194 to, the correctness of the decision in the last mentionedcase, we have no doubt that the analogy is inapt, for the principle of that decision can have no application to thecase before us. In the case of directors, who hold the majority of shares as trustees they, so far as the company isconcerned, are the registered shareholders and the right to vote is vested in them, although as between them andtheir beneﬁciaries the beneﬁcial interest is -vested in the latter. They are the registered holders of the shares andthe votes they cast are their own votes. That case is entirely diﬀerent from the case of directors who are only theagents of the holders of the majority of shares. When a shareholder holding the majority of shares authorises anagent to vote for him in respect of the shares so held by him, the agent acquires no interest, legal or beneﬁcial, inthe shares. The title in the shares remains vested in the shareholder. The shareholder may revoke the authority ofthe agent at any time. In spite of the appointment of the agent the shareholder may himself appear at the meetingand cast his votes personally. Therefore, the shares being always subject to his will and ordering, the controllinginterest which the holder of the majority of shares has never passes to the agent. Let us take the facts of thepresent case. Under article 90, when Mr. L.G. Bash as agent of the Aluminium Ltd. attends a general meeting ofthe respondent company he has to produce the resolution of his principals authorising him to cast the votes of hisprincipals. The votes he casts are not his votes but are the votes of the Aluminium Ltd. In such a situation, in theeye of the law, the controlling interest remains vested in the Aluminium Ltd. and is at no time vested in Mr. L. G.Bash. The shares in question which give the controlling interest are neither held by Mr. L. G. Bash nor are theysubject, directly or indirectly, to his will and ordering, and, therefore, he cannot, applying either of the testsmentioned above, be said to have a controlling interest.The decision of the Court of Appeal in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Jamed Hodgkinson (Salford) Ltd.(1) (1)(1949) 29 Tax Cas. 395.195 appears to us to be apposite. It is unfortunate that the last mentioned case was not brought to the notice ofthe High Court before the judgment under appeal was delivered.Dissent has been expressed in the judgment under appeal from the recent decision of the Bombay High Court inNew Shorrock Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay(1). The facts of thatwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1953/59.html3/4 9/12/2020COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, WEST BENGAL V. JEEWANLAL LTD.

The respondent company must pay the costs of the appellantin this court as well as in the High Court.Appeal allowed. Agent for the appellant: G. H.Rajadhyaksha. Agent for the respondent: S. C.

C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the Commissioner of Income-tax.1953. October 9. The Judgment of the Chief Justice and S. R. Das, Bose and Ghulam Hasan JJ. was delivered byBose J. Bhagwati J. delivered a separate dissenting judgment.Bose, J. This is an appeal by an assessee against a judgment and order of the High Court at Bombay delivered on areference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The Bombay High Court refused leave to appeal but theassessee obtained special leave from this court.The appellant deals in silver and shares and a sub- stantial part of his holding is kept in silver bullion and shares. Hisbusiness is run and owned by himself. His accounts are maintained according to the mercantile system.It is admitted that under this system stocks can be valued in one of two ways and provided there is no variation inthe method from year to year without the sanction of the Income- tax authorities an assessee can choosewhichever method he wishes. In this case, the method employed was the cost price method, that is to say, the costprice of the stock was entered at the beginning of the year and not its market value and similarly the cost price wasagain entered at the close of the year of any stock which was not disposed of during the year. The entries on theone side of the accounts at the beginning of the year thus balance those on the other in respect of these items withthe result that so far as they are concerned the books show neither a proﬁt nor a loss on them. This was themethod regularly employed and it is admitted on all hands that this was permissible under this system ofaccounting.221 The accounting year with which we are concerned is the calendar year 1942. The silver bars and shares lyingwith the appellant at the beginning of the year were valued at cost price.In the course of the year the appellant withdrew some bars and shares from the business and settled them oncertain trusts, three in number. The appellant was one of the beneﬁciaries in all three trusts retaining to himself areversionary life interest after the death of his wife who was given the ﬁrst life interest. After certain other lifeinterests the ultimate beneﬁciaries were charities. The appellant was the managing trustee expressly so created intwo of the trusts and virtually so in the third. In his books the appellant credited the business with the cost price ofthe bars and shares so withdrawn and there lies the crux of the issue which we have to determine. There is nosuggestion in this case that the bars and shares were withdrawn from the business otherwise than in good faith.According to the appellant, the act of withdrawal resulted in neither income nor proﬁt nor gain either to himself orto his business, nor was it a business trans- action, accordingly it was not taxable.The learned Attorney-General raised two contention.First, he said that as the bars and shares were brought into the business any withdrawal of them from the businessmust be dealt with along ordinary and well-known business lines, namely, that if a person withdraws an asset froma business he must account for it to the business at the market rate prevailing at the date of the withdrawal. Hesaid that the mere fact that the appellant was the sole owner of the busi- ness can make no diﬀerence, for underthe Act income is assessable under distinct beads and when we are working out the income of a business the rulesapplicable to business incomes must be applied whoever is the owner. His second contention was that if the act ofwithdrawal is at a time when the market price is higher than the cost price, then the State is deprived 39 222 of apotential proﬁt. He conceded that had the market rate been lower than the cost price, then the appellant wouldhave been entitled to set oﬀ the loss on those transactions against his overall proﬁt on the other transactions andthus obtain the advantage of a lower tax on the overall picture.We are of opinion that the learned Attorney-General's second contention is unsound because, for income taxpurposes, each year is a self-contained accounting period and we can only take into consideration income, proﬁtsand gains made in that year and are not concerned with potential proﬁts which may be made in another year anymore than we are with losses which may occur in the future.As regards the ﬁrst contention, we are of opinion that the appellant was right in entering the cost value of thesilver and shares at the date of the withdrawal, because it was not a business transaction and by that act thebusiness made no proﬁt or gain, nor did it sustain a loss, and the appellant derived no income from it. He may havestored up a future advantage for himself but as the transactions were not business ones and as he derived noimmediate pecuniary gain the State cannot tax them, for under the Income-tax Act the State has no power to tax apotential future advantage.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/60.html/19539599528 9/12/ 2020SIR KIKABHAI PREMCHAND V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX (CENTRAL), BOMBAY [] INSC 60; AIR 13 SC 509; 1…All it can tax is income, proﬁts and gains made in the relevant accounting year.It was conceded that if these assets had been sold at cost price the State could have claimed nothing, for a mancannot be compelled to make a proﬁt out of any particular transaction. It was also conceded that if the silver andstocks had lain where they were,, then again there would have been no advantage to the State because theappellant would have been entitled to enter their closing values at cost at the end of the year. The learnedAttorney-General even conceded that if they bad been sold at a loss the appellant would have been entitled to setthat oﬀ against his other gains, but he said that that is because all those are business transactions and that is theway the law deals with such matters when they occur in the ordinary course of 223 business. But, he argued, whenthere is a withdrawal and no sale or its equivalent, the matter is diﬀerent. As this is a business, any withdrawal ofthe assets is a business matter and the only feasible way of regarding it in a business light is to enter the marketprice at the date of the withdrawal and whether that happens to favour the assessee or the State is immaterial. Wedo not agree.It is well recognised that in revenue cases regard must be had to the substance of the transaction rather than to itsmere form. In the present case, disregarding technicalities, it is impossible to get away from the fact that thebusiness is owned and run by the assessee himself.In such circumstances we are of opinion that it is unreal and a artiﬁcial to separate the business from its owner andtreat them as if they were separate entities trading with each other and then by means of a ﬁctional sale introducea ﬁctional proﬁt which in truth and in fact is non-existent.Cut away the ﬁctions and you reach the position that the man is supposed to be selling to himself and therebymaking a proﬁt out of himself which on the face of it is not only absurd but against all canons of mercantile andincome-tax law. And worse. He may keep it and not show a proﬁt. He may sell it to another at a loss and cannot betaxed because he cannot be compelled to sell at a proﬁt. But in this purely ﬁctional sale to himself he is compelledto sell at a ﬁctional proﬁt when the market rises in order that he may be compelled to pay to Government a taxwhich is anything but ﬁctional.Consider this simple illustration. A man trades in rice and also uses rice for his family consumption. The bags are allstored in one godown and he draws upon his stock as and when he ﬁnds it necessary to do so, now for his business,now for his own use. What he keeps for his own personal use cannot be taxed however much the market rises; norcan he be taxed on what he gives away from his own personal stock, nor, so far as his shop is concerned, can he becompelled to sell at a proﬁt. If he keeps two sets of books and enters 224 in one all the bags which go into hispersonal godown and in the other the rice which is withdrawn from the godown into his shop, rice just suﬃcient tomeet the day to day demands of his customers so that only a negligible quantity is left over in the shop after eachday's sales, his private and personal dealings with the bags in his personal godown could not be taxed unless hesells them at a proﬁt. What be chooses to do with the rice in his godown is no concern of the Income-taxdepartment provided always that he does not sell it or otherwise make a proﬁt out of it. He can consume it, or giveit away, or just let it rot. Why should it make a diﬀerence if instead of keeping two sets of books he keeps only one? How can he be said to have made an income personally or his business a proﬁt, because he uses ten bags out ofhis godown for a feast for the marriage of his daughter ? How can it make any diﬀerence whether the bags areshifted directly from the godown to the kitchen or from the godown to the shop and from the shop to the kitchen,or from the shop back to the godown and from there to the kitchen ? And yet, when the reasoning of the learnedAttorney-General is pushed to its logical conclusion, the form of the transaction is of its essence and it is taxable ornot according to the route the rice takes from the godown to the wedding feast. In our opinion, it would make nodiﬀerence if the man instead of giving the feast himself hands over the rice to his daughter as a gift for themarriage festivities of her son.The appellant's method of book-keeping reﬂects the true position. As he makes his purchases he enters his stockat the cost price on one side of the accounts. At the close of the year he enters the value of any unsold stock at coston the other side of the accounts thus cancelling out the entries relating to the same unsold stock earlier in theaccounts; and then that is carried forward as the opening balance in the next year's accounts. This cancelling out ofthe unsold stock from both- sides of the accounts leaves only the transactions on which there have been actualsales and gives the 225 true and actual proﬁt or loss on his year's dealings. In the same way, the appellant hasreﬂected the true state of his ﬁnances and given a truthful picture of the proﬁt and loss in his business by enteringthe bullion and silver at cost when he withdrew them for a purely non-business purpose and utilised them in atransaction which brought him neither income nor proﬁt nor gain.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/60.html/19539599538 9/12/ 2020SIR KIKABHAI PREMCHAND V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX (CENTRAL), BOMBAY [] INSC 60; AIR 13 SC 509; 1…There is no case quite in point. The learned Attorney- General relied on Gold Coast Selection Trust Limited v.Humphrey (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) (1), but there the assessee received a new and valuable asset in exchange foranother in the ordinary course of his trade. It was held that he was bound to account for the receipt at a fair marketvaluation, for though the receipt was not money it was capable of being valued in terms of money. In the presentcase, the assessee's business received nothing in exchange for the withdrawal of the assets, neither money normoney's worth, therefore the only fair way of treating the matter was to do just what the appellant did, namely toenter the price at which the assets were valued at the beginning of the year so that the entries would cancel eachother out and leave the business with neither a gain nor a loss on those transactions.The learned Attorney-General contended that if that was allowed great loss would ensue to the State because all aman need do at the end of the year would be to withdraw all assets which had risen in value and leave only thosewhich had depreciated and thus either show a loss or reduce his taxable proﬁts.This argument can only prevail on the assumption that the State can tax potential proﬁts because, except for that,the State would neither gain nor lose in a case of this kind. Had the assets been left where they were, they wouldhave been valued at the end of the year as they were at the beginning, at the cost price and we would still bewhere we are now. But the assumption that there would be a gain at some future (1) 30 Tax Cas. 209 226 indeﬁnitedate is mere guess work for equally there might be loss. Apart, however, from that the learned Attorney- General'srule is equally capable of abuse. A man could as easily withdraw from the business assets which had depreciatedand enter in his books the depreciated market value and leave at cost price the assets which had risen.There are two cases which bear a superﬁcial resem- blance to this case. They are In the matter of Messrs.Chouthmal Golapchand (1) and In re The Spanish Prospecting Company Limited (1).We refrain from expressing any opinion about them, especially as they appear to reach diﬀerent conclusions,because the facts are not the same and the questions which arose on the facts there were not argued here. Theyraise matters of wider import which will require consideration in a suitable case. These cases were not cases of abusiness owned and run by a single owner and so the ﬁction of treating the business as a separate entity from itsowner actually trading with him, which we are asked to apply here, does not arise. In the next place, the businessesthere were not con-tinuing as here.In the Calcutta case, a partnership was would up and the question related to the valuation of assets consisting ofstocks and shares, on the dissolution. In the English case, a company with no ﬁxed capital was under liquidationand the question was whether the market value of certain debentures which the company had purchased ought tobe brought into the proﬁt and loss account so as to augment the proﬁts actually shown in the balance-sheet. Thecompany wished to treat those debentures as of no value and thus show a much smaller proﬁt than wouldotherwise have been the case. On the answer to that question hung the fate of two servants of the company who,under the terms of their agreement with the company, could only be paid their salaries out of the proﬁts of thecompany. In our opinion, neither case is apposite here.(1) [ 1938] 6 I.T.R. 733. (2) [ 1910] UKLawRpCh 125; [ 1911] 1 Ch, 92, 227 The questions referred were:- "" (1) Whether inthe circumstances of the case any income arose to the assessee as a result of the transfer of shares and silver barsto the trustees ? (2) If the answer to the question (1) is in the aﬃrmative, whether the method employed by theAppellate Assistant Commissioner and upheld by the Appellate Tribunal in computing the assessee's income fromthe transfer is the proper method for computing the income?"" Our answer to the ﬁrst question is that in thecircumstances of this case no income arose to the appellant as a result of the transfer of the shares and silver barsto the trustees. In view of that the second question does not arise.The appeal is allowed with costs.BHAGWATI J.-This appeal by special leave from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay on areference by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under section 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act (XI of 1922) raisesan interesting question as to the valuation of an asset withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of a running business.The assessee was in the year-of account (calendar year 1942) a dealer in shares and silver. On the 21st January,1942, be withdrew from the business certain shares and silver bars and executed two deeds of trust and on the19th October, 1942, he withdrew further shares and silver bars and executed a third deed of trust. The terms andconditions of the deeds of trust are not material for the purpose of this appeal.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/60.html/19539599548 9/12/ 2020SIR KIKABHAI PREMCHAND V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX (CENTRAL), BOMBAY [] INSC 60; AIR 13 SC 509; 1…The assessee kept his books of account on the mercantile basis and the method employed by him in the past forvaluing the closing stock of his stock-in-trade was valuation at the cost price thereof. The deeds of trust werevalued for the purpose of stamp at the market value of the shares and silver bars prevailing at the dates of theirexecution. The assessee however showed the transfer of these shares and silver bars to 228 the trustees in thebooks of account at the cost price thereof thus setting oﬀ the debit shown in respect of the same at the beginningof the year of account. He contended that the market value of the said shares and silver bars on which the stampduty was based could not be the basis for computing his income from the stock-in-trade thus transferred. TheIncome-tax authorities did not accept this contention and assessed the proﬁt at the diﬀerence between the costprice of the said shares and silver bars and the market value thereof at the date of their withdrawal from thebusiness. The Income-tax Oﬃcer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner as also the Income-tax Appellate Tribunalrejected this contention of the assessee and the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal submitted at the instance of theassessee a case under section 66(1) of the Act referring the following two questions for the decision of the HighCourt","- ""(1) Whether in the circumstances of the case any income arose to the petitioner as a result of the transferof shares and silver bars to the trustees ? (2)If the answer to the question (1) is in the aﬃrmative, whether themethod employed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and upheld by the Appellate Tribunal in computingthe petitioner's income from the transfer is the proper method for computing the income ? "" The High Courtanswered both the questions in the aﬃrmative.It was not disputed before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal that the shares transferred were the stock-in-trade ofthe business. As regards the silver bars the Tribunal found that the assessee had been making purchases and salesfrequently and that the silver also was stock-in-trade and not a capital investment. Both the shares and the silverbars were thus part of the stock-in-trade of the business.They had been purchased by the assessee from time to time and formed part of the stock-in-trade of the businessand had been shown at the cost price thereof in the books of account of the previous years and also at the openingof the year of account, 229 If the shares and the silver bars which were thus withdrawn from the stock-in-trade ofthe business had continued to form part of the stock-in-trade at the closing of the year of account, the value ofthese shares and silver bars would also have been shown at the cost price in accordance with the system ofaccounts maintained by the assessee. The question however which falls to be determined is what is the eﬀect ofthese assets having been withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the business.So far as the business itself is concerned the asset which has been brought in is of a particular value at the datewhen it has been so brought in and it is then valued in the books of account at its cost. In the course of the businesshowever the asset appreciates or depreciates in value in accordance with the ﬂuctuations of the market. If the costprice basis is adopted for the valuation of the stock-in-trade at the close of the year this appreciation ordepreciation in the value as the case may be would not be reﬂected in the accounts. If however the market valuebasis is adopted for such Valuation, the asset on being valued at the market rate thereof at the close of the yearmight show a loss and this loss would be allowed by the Income-tax authorities in computing the proﬁt or loss ofthe business. In either event, the assessee would have to carry over the asset in the books of account of thesubsequent year at the valuation adopted at the close of the previous year and the assessee would not be allowedto change the basis of valuation thus adopted unless he chose to adopt at the end of the subsequent year or yearsvaluation at the cost price or the market value thereof whichever was lower. This process would continue until theasset is realised. When the asset is realised the assessee would have to show the actual price realised by the sale ofthe asset in the books of account and the diﬀerence between the price thus realised and the value shown in thebeginning of the year of account would be the proﬁt or loss as the case may be, in regard to that asset and thatproﬁt or loss 31 230 would be allowed by the Income-tax authorities in the computation of proﬁt or loss for thatyear of account. The adoption of the one or the other basis of valuation would not however make any diﬀerence inthe ultimate result. On the cost price basis of valuation all intermediate ﬂuctuations of price during the intervalbetween the bringing of the I asset in the business and the realisation of it would be eliminated and the only thingconsidered in the accounts would be the diﬀerence between the price of the asset when it was brought into thebusiness and the price thereof when the asset was realised. On the other hand, the market value basis would bringinto account each year the ﬂuctuations in the market value of the asset as at the close of every year of accountuntil the asset was realised with the result that in each and every year of account a rectiﬁcation would have to bemade in the result of the trading of the previous year which was not correctly reﬂected in the accounts by reasonof the assessee having adopted the market value obtaining at the close of the previous year as the value of theasset. This process of rectiﬁcation would continue from' year to year until the asset was realised in a particular yearof account when the actual price realised on the sale of the asset would be brought into account in that year. Theultimate result of these operations so far as the asset itself is concerned would be no diﬀerent. Because if regardwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/60.html/19539599558 9/12/ 2020SIR KIKABHAI PREMCHAND V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX (CENTRAL), BOMBAY [] INSC 60; AIR 13 SC 509; 1…be had to the various ﬂuctuations in the market value which have been reﬂected in the accounts of theintermediate period, what the business actually gains or loses would be the diﬀerence between the cost price ofthe asset when it was brought in and the price at which it was sold when it was actually realised. The onlyadvantage which the assessee obtains would be that he would be able to anticipate in a particular year the lossthat may be made on the asset in the following year or years, which however might have to be rectiﬁed in thefollowing year or years if the prices rose again.Is there any diﬀerence in the position when instead of the asset being realised is withdrawn from the stock- 231 in-trade of the business ? So far as the business is concerned the asset ceases to be a part of the stock-in- tradewhether it is realised or is withdrawn from the stock- in-trade. The asset after it has been brought into the businessappreciates or depreciates in value in accordance with the ﬂuctuations of the market and that appreciated ordepreciated asset continues to be a part of the stock-in- trade of the business until it is realised or withdrawn.This appreciation or depreciation in value is not reﬂected in the books of account when the cost price basis isadopted for the valuation of the stock-in-trade at the close of the year of account, but is certainly reﬂected asabove indicated in the books of account at the close of each year of account when the market value basis isadopted. In each case however the actual proﬁt or loss to the business as the case may be in relation to the price atwhich the asset was brought into the business would be determined at the date when the asset is realised, Thatwould be the measure of the appreciation or depreciation in value of the asset which till then formed a part of thestock-in-trade of the business, and would I also be the measure of the ultimate proﬁt or loss as the case may be ofthe business in regard to that particular asset. When the asset is withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the businessthe position in my opinion would be no diﬀerent. So far as the business is concerned the asset would go out andcease to be a part of its stock-in-trade and this again would be the measure of the proﬁt or loss as the case may beof the business qua that particular asset. To my mind it makes not the slightest diﬀerence whether an asset isrealised in the course of the business or is withdrawn from the stock-in- trade of the business. An asset which hasappreciated or depreciated in value as the case may be in accordance with the ﬂuctuations of the market ceases tobe a part of the business, by the one process or the other. So far as the, business is concerned it is entitled to creditin its goods account the price of that asset as has been realised by the sale thereof or the market value of thatasset as at the date of its withdrawal, 232 Looking at the matter from assessee's point of view also it does notmake any the slightest diﬀerence whether he realises the asset in the course of the business or withdraws it fromthe business and utilises it in any manner he chooses. Having brought into the business an asset which was of aparticular value at that time, he withdraws from the business that asset at a time when it has appreciated ordepreciated in value. The business would be entitled to the appreciation or depreciation in value of that asset in sofar as the asset had become a part of the stock-in-trade of the business. When the asset is withdrawn by theassessee, the assessee obtains in his hands by reason of such withdrawal an asset which at the time of thewithdrawal has appreciated or depreciated in value as the case may be in comparison with its value at the timewhen it was brought into the business and the assessee on such withdrawal would be able to deal with or disposeof an asset which had thus appreciated or depreciated in value. In my opinion the manner of his dealing with theasset after he withdraws it from the stock-in-trade of the business is really immaterial. What is material to consideris what is the value of the asset which he was withdrawn from the stock-in- trade of the business and that valuecan only be determined by the market value of the asset as at the date of its withdrawal.It was urged that the withdrawal of the asset from the stock-in-trade of the business was not a business operationand that an entry on the credit side crediting the cost price of the particular asset would therefore be enough.This argument however does not take into account the appreciation or the depreciation in the value of the asseton the date of the withdrawal as compared with its value when it was initially brought into the business. It alsodoes not take into account the fact that the assessee might have adopted the market value basis for valuation ofthe stock-intrade on hand at the close of the previous year or years of account. The entry on the debit side at thebegin- ning of the year of account would not then represent the cost price of the asset but would represent 233 themarket value of the asset at the close of the previous year of account. What would then be the rational basis onwhich the credit entry should be made at the date of withdrawal? Should it be the cost price of the asset which wasnot at all reﬂected into the accounts except at the initial stage when the asset was brought into the business or themarket value of the asset when it was withdrawn ? Surely the method of accounts keeping cannot make anydiﬀerence to the actual position, whether an asset has appreciated or depreciated in value and what proﬁt or loss ifany accrued to the business when the asset was withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the business. There is also afurther fact to be considered and it is that when the asset is withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the businessthere would be of necessity an entry in the account of the person withdrawing it debiting the price of that asset towww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/13/60.html/19539599568 9/12/ 2020SIR KIKABHAI PREMCHAND V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX (CENTRAL), BOMBAY [] INSC 60; AIR 13 SC 509; 1…him. If the assessee withdraws from the stock-in-trade of the business an asset which has thus appreciated ordepreciated in value, is there any justiﬁcation whatever for debiting him with the cost price of that asset and notthe market value of the asset as at the date of withdrawal? In the event of the asset having appreciated in valuethe assessee should be debited in his account with the appreciated market value of the asset inasmuch as hewithdraws from the stock- in-trade of the business an asset which is at that date of that market value. If howeverthe asset has depreciated in value the assessee should certainly not be mulcted. He withdraws from the stock-in-trade of the business an asset which is of a depreciated value as compared with its value when it was brought intothe business and he should not certainly be debited with a higher price even though it may be the cost price asappearing in the books of account according to the particular system of accounting adopted by the assessee.I am therefore deﬁnitely of the opinion that even in the case of withdrawal as in the case of the realisation of theasset the business is entitled to credit in the goods account the market value of the asset as at the date of itswithdrawal whatever be the method adopted 234 by it for valuation of its stock-in-trade on hand at the close of ayear of account.Shri R. J. Kolah appearing for the appellant parti- cularly relied upon a decision of the Calcutta High Court, In thematter of Messrs. Chouthmal Golapchand (1). The assessees there were the ﬁrm of Messrs. ChouthmalGolapchand constituted by four partners with equal shares, and they had at the beginning of the accounting year1935-36 an opening stock of shares valued at cost price of Rs.85,331. On the 8th January, 1936, the partners resolved to dissolve the ﬁrm with eﬀect from the 30th March, 1936,and in view of the pending dissolution they divided amongst themselves on the 9th March, 1936, these shareswhich were then valued at the rates prevailing in the market at an aggregate sum of Rs. 51,966. There was adiﬀerence of Rs.33,365 between the value of the opening' stock, viz., Rs.85,331, and the then market valuation of Rs. 51,966 and this diﬀerence was claimed by the assessees as a loss inthe assessment. This claim of the assessees was negatived on the ground that there was nothing to show that losshad occurred in the year of account. The assessees having adopted the system of valuing the shares at cost price atthe end of every year and the opening of the next year, the cost price of the shares was taken to have been theirvalue at the beginning of the year of account and the partition was taken as not amounting to a sale of the shareswith the result that there was no evidence of any loss. With great respect to the learned Judges I do not see myway to agree with the reasoning of this judgment. Apart from the fact that this distribution of shares amongst thepartners was in view of the impending dissolution of the ﬁrm and diﬀerent considerations may arise when oneconsiders the distribution of the assets of a dissolved partnership amongst its partners, the judgment does nottake count of the fact that at the date of the partition the assets which had been brought into the business at theearlier dates had depreciated in value and it was these depreciated (1) [ 1938] 6 1. T. R. 733.235 assets which were the subject-matter of partition between the partners. Even if the partition be not treated asa sale it was a transfer of property, the property of the ﬁrm being transferred to the individual partners thereof andeach partner obtaining an absolute interest in the shares thus transferred to him by the ﬁrm to the exclusion of theother partners therein. So far as the ﬁrm was concerned it was certainly a transfer of the property to the individualpartners and even as regards the partners themselves it was a transfer of the interest of the partners inter se in theshares respectively transferred absolutely to each of them.If it were necessary to do so I would certainly say that the case was erroneously decided. [ See also the judgment ofFletcher Moulton L. J. in In re Spanish Prospecting Co., Ltd.

THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS [14] INSC 1; AIR 14 SC 24; 1…H. J. Umrigar for the respondents.1954. January 11. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.--This is an application presented bythe petitioners under article 32 of the Constitution, complaining of infraction of their fundamental rightsguaranteed under article 14 and clauses (f) and (g) of article 19 (1) of the Constitution and praying for enforcementof the same by issue of writs in the nature of mandamus.To appreciate the contentions that have been raised on behalf of the petitioners, it would be necessary to give ashort narrative of the material facts. The petitioners are a ﬁrm of traders who had, prior to the cancellation of theirlicenee, been carrying on the business of retail sellers of coal at a coal depot held by them in the town of Kanpur. Itis said that the District Magistrate of Kanpur as well as the District Supply Oﬃcer, who ﬁgure respectively asrespondents Nos. 2 and 3 in the petition, had been for a considerable time past issuing directives from time to timeupon the petitioners as well as other coal depot holders of the town, imposing restrictions of various kinds uponthe sale of coal, soft coke, etc. It is stated that prior to the 14th of February, 1953, the prices that were ﬁxed by theDistrict Oﬃcers left the coal dealers a margin of 20 per cent proﬁt upon the sale of soft coke and 15 per cent proﬁton the sales of hard coke and steam coal, such proﬁts being allowed on the landed costs of the goods up to thedepot.The landed costs 805 comprised several items and besides ex-colliery price, the middleman's commission and therailway freight, there were incidental expenses of various kinds including labour duty, loading and unloadingcharges, cartage and stacking expenses. After making a total of these cost elements, an allowance was given forshortage of weight at the rate of 5 rods and odd seers per ton in the case of soft coke and 3 rods and odd seers inthe case of hard coke and steam coal, and it was on the basis of the net weight thus arrived at that the price wascalculated. On the 14th of February, 1953, the District Supply Oﬃcer issued a directive reducing the selling pricesof coke, coal, etc., much below the existing rates. This reduction was eﬀected in a three-fold manner. In the ﬁrstplace, the allowance for shortage of weight was made much less than before; secondly a sum of Rs. 4-12-0 onlywas allowed for all the incidental expenses, and thirdly, the margin of proﬁt was cut down to 10 per cent. On the22nd of May, 1953, a representative petition was ﬁled by seven colliery depot holders of Kanpur including thepresent petitioners challenging the validity of the executive order, dated the 14th of February, 1953, mentionedabove inter alia on the ground that it infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioners under articles 14 and 19 ofthe Constitution. There was an application for ad interim stay in connection with this petition which came up forhearing before the learned Vacation Judge of this court on the Ist of July, 1953. On that day an undertaking wasgiven by the State of Uttar Pradesh to the eﬀect that they would withdraw the order of the 14th February, 1953,and apparently the consideration that weighed with the State in giving this undertaking was that it was a purelyexecutive order without any legislative sanction behind it. The order of the 14th February was in fact withdrawn,but on the 10th of July, 1953, the State of Uttar Pradesh promulgated by a notiﬁcation an order intituled ""TheUttar Pradesh Coal Control Order, 1953"" purporting to act in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by_section3(2) of the Essential Supplies Act, 1946, read with the notiﬁed order of the Government of India issued under 806section 4 of the Act.

The result, accordingto the petitioners, was that the selling prices were reduced so much that it was not possible for the coal traders tocarry on their business at all. In accordance with the provision of clause 11 of the Control Order set out above, thepetitioners' name appeared in the list of B licence holders and they did apply for a licence in the proper form asrequired by clause (4). The licence, it is said, was prepared, though not actually delivered over to the petitioners. Bya letter dated the 3rd of October, 1953, the Area Rationing Oﬃcer, Kanpur, accused the petitioners of committinga number of irregularities in connection with the carrying on of the coal depot. The charges mainly were that therewere two other depots held and ﬁnanced by the petitioners themselves in the names of diﬀerent persons and thatthe petitioners had entered into agreements for sale of coal at more than the ﬁxed rates. The petitionerssubmitted an explanation which was not considered to be satisfactory and by an order dated the 13th of October,1953, the District Supply Oﬃcer, Kanpur, cancelled the petitioners'licence. In the present petition the petitionershave challenged the validity of the Coal Control Order of the 10th of July, 1953, the declaration of prices made onthe 16th of July following and also the order cancelling the petitioners' licence on the 13th of October, 1953.15--95 S. C. I./59 The constitutional validity of the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order has been assailed before ussubstantially on the ground that its provisions vest an unfettered and unguided discretion in the licensing authorityor the State Coal Controller in the matter of granting or revoking licenses, in ﬁxing prices of coal and imposingconditions upon the traders; and these arbitrary powers cannot only be exercised by the oﬃcers themselves butmay be delegated at their option to any person they like. It is argued that these provisions imposing as they dounreasonable restrictions upon the right of the petitioners to carry on their' trade and business conﬂict with theirfundamental rights under article 19 (1)(g) of the Constitution and are hence void. With regard to the order datedthe 16th of July, 1953, by which the prices of coke, coal, etc. were ﬁxed, it is pointed out that it was not only madein exercise of the arbitrary power Conferred upon the licensing authority by the Coal Control Order, but the prices,as ﬁxed, are palpably discriminatory as would appear from comparing them with the prices ﬁxed under the verysame Control Order in other places within the State of Uttar Pradesh like Allahabad, Lucknow and Aligarh. Theorder of the 13th OCtober, 1953, cancelling the petitioners' licenee is challenged on the ground that the chargesmade against the ,petitioners were vague and indeﬁnite and that the order was made with the ulterior object ofdriving the petitioners out of the coal business altogether. It is said further that as a result of the cancellation order,the petitioners have been made incapable of disposing of the stocks already in their possession, though at thesame time the holding of such,stock after the cancellation of their licence has become an oﬀence under the CoalControl Order.It is not disputed before us that coal is an essential commodity under the Essential Supplies (Temporary ,Powers)Act of 1946, and by virtue of the delegation powers by the Central Government to the Provincial Governmentunder section 4 of the Act, the Uttar Pradesh Government was competent to make provisions, by notiﬁed order,for regulating the supply and 811 distribution of coal in such a way as they considered proper with a view to securethe objects as speciﬁed in section 3 of the Act. All that is necessary is that these provisions should not infringe thefundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution and if they impose restrictionsupon the carrying on of trade or business, they must be reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of thegeneral public as laid down in article 19 (6)of the Constitution.Nobody can dispute that for ensuring equitable distribution of commodities considered essential to thecommunity and their availability at fair prices, it is quite a reasonable thing to regulate sale of these commoditiesthrough licensed vendors to whom quotas are allotted in speciﬁed quantities and who are not permitted to sellthem beyond the prices that are ﬁxed by the controlling authorities. The power of granting or withholding licencesor of ﬁxing the prices of the goods would necessarily have to be vested in certain public oﬃcers or bodies and theywould certainly have to be left with some amount of discretion in these matters. So far no exception can be taken;but the mischief arises when the power conferred on such oﬃcers is an arbitrary power unregulated by any rule orprinciple and it is left entirely to the discretion of particular persons to do anything they like without any check orcontrol by any higher authority. A law or order, which confers arbitrary and uncontrolled power upon the executivewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/1.html/02095952959547 9/12/2MESSRS. DW ARKA PRASAD LAXMI NARAIN V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS [14] INSC 1; AIR 14 SC 24; 1…in the matter of regulating trade or business in normally available commodities cannot but be held to beunreasonable. As has been held, by this court in Chintamon v. The State of Madhya Pradesh(1), the phrase""reasonable restriction,' connotes that the limitation imposed upon a person in enjoyment of a right should not bearbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is required in the interest of the public. Legislation, whicharbitrarily or excessively invades the right, cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness, and unless itstrikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed under (1) [ 1950] INSC 29; [ 1950] S. C.R. 759.article 19 (1) (g) and the social control permitted by clause (6) of article 19, it must be held to be wanting inreasonableness. It is in the light of these principles that we would proceed to examine the provisions of this controlOrder, the validity of Which has been impugned before us on behalf of the petitioners.The provision contained in clause 3(1) of the Order that ""no person shall stock, sell, store for sale or otherwiseutilise or dispose of coal except under a licence granted under this Order"" is quite unexceptional as a generalprovision; in fact, that is the primary object which the control Order is intended to serve. There are two exceptionsengrafted upon this general rule: the ﬁrst is laid down in sub-clause (2) (a) and to that no objection has been or canbe taken. The Second exception, which is embodied in subclause (2)(b)has been objected to by the learnedcounsel' appearing for the petitioners. This exception provides that nothing in clause 3 (1) shall apply to any personor class of persons exempted from any provision of the above sub-clause by the State Coal Controller, to theextent of such exemption. It will be seen that the Control Order nowhere indicates what the grounds forexemption are, nor have any rules been framed on this point. An unrestricted power has been given to the StateController to make exemptions, and even if he acts arbitrarily or from improper motives, there is no check over itand no way of obtaining redress. Clause 3 (2) (b) of the Cntrol Order seems to us, therefore, prima facie to beunreasonable. We agree, however, with Mr. Umrigar that this portion of the Control Order, even though bad, isseverable from the rest and we are not really concerned with the validity or otherwise of this provision in thepresent case as no action taken under it is the subject matter of any complaint before us.The more formidable objection has been taken on behalf of the petitioners against clause 4 (3) of the ControlOrder which relates to the granting and refusing of licences. The licensing authority has been given absolutepower to grant or refuse to grant, renew or refuse to renew, suspend, revoke, cancel or 813 modify any liceneeunder this Order and the only thing he has to do is to record reasons for the action he takes.Not only so, the power could be exercised by any person to whom the State Coal Controller may choose todelegate the same, and the choice can be made in favour of any and every person. It seems to us that suchprovision cannot be held to be reasonable. No rules have been framed and no directions given on these matters toregulate or guide the discretion of the licensing oﬃcer. Practically the Order commits to the unrestrained will of asingle 'individual the power to grant, withhold or cancel licences in any way he chooses and there is nothing in theOrder which could ensure a proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon injustice that might resultfrom improper execution of the same. Mr. Umrigar contends that a suﬃcient safeguard has been provided againstany abuse of power by reason of the fact that the licensing authority has got to record reasons for what he does.This safeguard, in our opinion, is hardly eﬀective; for there is no higher authority prescribed in the Order whocould examine the propriety of these reasons and revise or review the decision of the subordinate oﬃcer. Thereasons, therefore, which are required to be recorded are only for the personal or subjective satisfaction of thelicensing authority and not for furnishing any remedy to the aggrieved person. It was pointed out and with perfectpropriety by Mr. Justice Matthews in the well-known American case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins(1), that the action ornon-action of oﬃcers placed in such position may proceed from emmity or prejudice, from .... partisan zeal oranimosity, from favouritism and Other improper inﬂuences and motives which are easy of concealment anddiﬃcult to be detected and exposed and consequently 'the injustice capable of being wrought under'cover of suchunrestricted power becomes apparent to every man, without the necessity of detailed investigation. In ouropinion, the provision of clause 4(3) of the Uttar Pradesh Coal control Order must be must be held to void asimposing an unreasonable restriction upon the freedom (1) 118 U. S. 356 at 373.814 of trade and business_guaranteed under article 19(1) (g)of the Constitution and not coming within theprotection aﬀorded by clause (6) of the article.As this provision forms an integral part of the entire structure of the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order, the ordercannot operate properly unless the provision of clause 4 (3) is brought in conformity with the constitutionalrequirements indicated above. The licenee of the petitioners having been cancelled in pursuance with the aboveclause of the Control Order, the cancellation itself should be held to be ineﬀective and is not necessary for us towww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/1.html/02095952959557 9/12/2MESSRS.

THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS [14] INSC 1; AIR 14 SC 24; 1…enquire further whether or not the grounds upon which the licensing authority purported to act were vague orideﬁnite or could constitute proper grounds for cancellation.The two other clauses of the Control Order to which exception has been taken on behalf of the petitioners areclauses (7) and (8). Clause (7) empowers the State Coal Controller to direct, by written order, any person holdingstock of coal to sell the whole or any part of the stock to such person or class of persons and on such terms andprices as may be determined in accordance with the provision of clause (8). Clause 8 (1) provides that no licensee inForm 'B' shall sell or agree to sell coal at a price exceeding the price to be declared by the licensing authority inaccordance with the formula given in Schedule III. With regard to both these clauses, the contention of thepetitioners' counsel, in substance, is that the formula for determining the price, as laid down in Schedule III, is perse unreasonable as it is made dependent on the exercise of an unfettered and uncontrolled discretion by thelicensing authority. An unfair determination of the price by the licensing authority, it is argued, would be totallydestructive of the business of the coal traders and the grievance of the petitioners is that that is exactly what hasbeen done by the declaration of prices made on the 16th of July, 1953.We have examined the formula given in Schedule Iii to the Control Order with some care and on the materials thathave been actually placed before us, we are 815 not in a position to say that the formula is unreasonable. 'Theprices, as said already, are calculated on the basis of the landed costs of coke and coal up to the depot, 'to which aproﬁt of 10 per cent is added. The landed costs comprise seven items in all which are enumerated' in Schedule III.With regard to items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the Schedule the actual costs are taken into, account and to that noobjection can possibly be taken. The entire dispute is with regard to incidental charges speciﬁed in item 5 and theallowance or shortage which forms item 7. So far as incidental charges are concerned, the Schedule allows amaximum of Rs. 8-8-0 per ton to be determined by the licensing authority according to local conditions. The ratesundoubtedly vary according to local conditions and some amount of discretion must have to be left in such casesto the local authorities. The discretion given to the licensing authority in ﬁxing these rates is, however, not anunlimited discretion, but has got to be exercised with reference to the condition prevalent in the locality withwhich the local oﬃcers, must be presumed to be familiar. The grievance of the petitioners is that in the declarationof 16th of July, 1953, the licensing authority allowed incidental charges only at the rate of Rs. 4-12-0 per ton andthat is grossly unfair. It is pointed out that at Lucknow, Aligarh, Allahabad and other places much higher rates wereallowed, 'though the local conditions of these places are almost identical; and there has been consequently adiscrimination in this respect which makes the declaration void altogether. The statements that have been madeby the petitioners in this connection are not supported by any aﬃdavit of any person who is familiar with the localconditions in the other places and on the materials that we have got here we are unable to say that the rates ﬁxedby the licensing authority of Kanpur are really discriminatory.It is certainly not open to us to substitute our own determination in tile matter of ﬁxing the prices for that of thelicensing authority and provided we are satisﬁed that the discretion that has been vested in a public oﬃcer is notan uncontrolled discretion and no unfair 816 discrimination has resulted from the exercise of it, we cannot possiblystrike down as illegal any order or declaration made by such oﬃcer.The same reasons apply, in our opinion, to the seventh item of Schedule III which relates to allowances forshortage of weight. Here also the Control Order speciﬁes a maximum and the determination of the allowance inparticular cases has been left to the discretion of the licensing authority. We are not satisﬁed from the materialsplaced before us that this provision is unfair or discriminatory. The formula allows a proﬁt of loper cent upon thecost items with the exception of item No. 5 which relates to incidental charges.We do not know why this item has been omitted and Mr.Umrigar, appearing for the respondents, could not suggest any possible reason for it. But even then, the result ofthis omission would only be to lower the margin of proﬁt a little below 10 per cent and nothing more. If the othertraders in the locality are willing to carry on business in coal with that amount of proﬁt, as is stated on theaﬃdavits of the respondents, such ﬁxation of proﬁt would undoubtedly be in the interests of the public and cannotbe held to be unreasonable. The counsel for the petitioners is not right in his contention that the Control Order hasonly ﬁxed the maximum proﬁt at 10 per cent and has left it to the discretion of the licensing authority to reduce itin any way he likes. Schedule III ﬁxes the proﬁt at 10 per cent upon the landed costs with the exception of item No.5 and as this is not the maximum, it would have to be allowed in all cases and under clause 8 (1), the 'B' licenseesare to sell their stocks of coal according to the prices ﬁxed under Schedule III.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/1.html/02095952959567 9/12/2MESSRS. DW ARKA PRASAD LAXMI NARAIN V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS [14] INSC 1; AIR 14 SC 24; 1…Clause 8 (2) indeed is not very clearly worded, but we think that all that it provides is to impose a disability upon allholders of coal stocks to charge prices exceeding the landed costs and a proﬁt upon the same not above 10 percent as may be determined by the licensing authority. The determination spoken of here must be in accordancewith what is laid down in Schedule III and that, as has been said above, does specify a ﬁxed rate and not amaximum and does' not 817 allow the licensing authority to make any reduction he:likes. On the whole we are of the opinion that clauses (7 is and (8) of the Control Order do not imposeunreasonable restrictions upon the freedom of trade enjoyed by the petitioners and consequently the declaration.of the 16th of July, 1953, cannot I;e held to be invalid. The result is that, in our opinion, clause 4 (3) of the ControlOrder as well as the cancellation of the petitioners licence should be held to be invalid and -a writ in the nature ofmandamus would issue against the respondents opposite parties preventing them from enforcing the cancellationorder. The rest of the prayers of the petitioners are disallowed. We make no order as to costs.Petition partly allowed.Agent for the petitioners: Ganpat Rai.Agent for the respondents: C. P. Lal."

THE EX CISE COMMISSIONER AND THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER [14] INSC 2; AIR 14 SC …1954. January 13. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN C. J.-This petition under article 32 of theConstitution of India arises in the following circumstances.The Collector of Excise, Ajmer, respondent No. 3, on the 16th March, 1953, held an auction sale of "" Chang Gatecountry liquor shop, Beawar,"" for the year 1953-54 -pursuant to the rules framed under' Excise Regulation I of 1915.The petitioner and respondent No. 5, Chhoga La], oﬀered bids at the auction sale. Chhoga Lal, whose bid was inthe sum of Rs. 57,000, was declared the highest bidder and the petitioner who was the former licensee was thusunsuccessful in obtaining the contract to run this liquor shop as hereinbefore. Half of the auction price was payableimmediately on the provisional acceptance of the bid.Chhoga Lal, however, deposited Rs. 16,500 on the 16th March, 1953, and the balance of Rs. 12,000 ,on the 18thMarch, 1953, i.e., two days after the due date, contrary to the provisions of sub-rule 8(a) of rule 6 of the auctionrules.In spite of this the sale was eventually conﬁrmed in his favour by the Minister of Excise.The petitioner, when apprised of this irregularity, sent a telegram to the Collector of Excise stating that 875 thesale should not be conﬁrmed in favour of Chhoga Lal as he had failed in paying the price according to the rules,and expressing his willingness to take the licence.on the price fetched at that auction sale. He also preferred anappeal to the Chief Commissioner against the order of the Collector allowing the deposit of Rs.' 12,000 after thedue date and in not ordering a resale. His appeal and representation both were unsuccessful. He claims redress forboth these grievances by means of this petition.The petition is founded on the following allegations:(1) That the petitioner's fundamental right to carry on trade or business in liquor under article 19(1)(g)had beeninfringed by the act of the Collector of Excise, in condoning the failure of the respondent in depositing the wholeof the security deposit required under sub-rule 8(a) of rule 6 of the auction rules within the prescribed time and innot reauctioning the licence under sub-rule 9 of rule 6.(2)That in allowing-, Chhoga Lal to make the deposit after the expiry of the prescribed time the Collector haddiscriminated between. him and Chhoga Lal and had thus abridged the petitioner's fundamental right underarticle14. It is alleged that if the petitioner had known that the Collector would enlarge the time for the security deposithe would have oﬀered a higher bid.(3) That the Hon. Minister for Excise, respondent No. 2, had no authority under the regulation to conﬁrm theauction sale held by the Collector.(4)That the summary rejection of his appeal without hearing was not justiﬁed and has resulted in the abridgementof his right to carry on his trade.(5)That the provisions of the Excise Regulation and the auction rules made thereunder were ultra vires as the samepurport to grant monopoly of trade to a few persons and are thus inconsistent with article 19(1) (g) of theConstitution and that the provisions of the regulation regarding levy of licence fee with the avowed object ofraising a big source of revenue also 876 seriously aﬀected the fundamental rights of the petitioner under article19(1) (g) of the Constitution. On these allegations the petitioner prayed for a writ of mandamus or a writ in thenature thereof or a direction or order on respondents Nos. I to 4 directing them, (a) not to levy any duty or fee forthe purpose of raising revenues for the beneﬁt of the State by holding auction sales, (b) not to grant monopoly inthe trade to a selected few individuals, but to grant licences freely on application, and (c) to grant a licence to thepetitioner to deal in country liquor with his place of business at or near Chang Gate, Beawar.In the alternative a mandamus was asked directing the oﬃcer concerned either to conﬁrm the next lower bid ofthe petitioner and to grant the licence for Chang Gate liquor shop, Beawar, in his favour or to hold a reduction inaccordance with the auction rules and to cancel the licence of respondent No. 5.Some of the points raised are clearly outside the ambit of the constitutional remedy provided under article 32 ofthe Constitution and will be considered hereinafter. The main contention which needs consideration in the case isregarding the constitutional validity of the Excise Regulation I of 1915. It was contended that the petitioner, awww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 2.html/02095959525 9/12/2COOVERJEE B. BHARUCHA V. THE EX CISE COMMISSIONER AND THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER [14] INSC 2; AIR 14 SC …citizen of free India, had an unfettered right to carry on trade and business in liquor and this right had beenguaranteed to him under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution, and that being so, the provisions of the regulationwhich confer discretion on the Excise Commissioner to restrict the number of liquor shops, and to license them byauction to the higher bidder amount to creation of a monopoly in liquor trade and are void. The excessive licencefee recovered by public auction was attacked on the ground I that it was not in the nature of a licence fee but wasin the nature of a tax and this could not be 877 recovered by having resort to the powers of legislation saved byarticle 19 (6) of the Constitution.In order to determine the validity of these contentions, it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of theregulation which consolidates and amends the law relating to import, export, transport, manufacture, sale andpossession of intoxicating liquors and of intoxicating drugs, in the Provinces of Ajmer-Merwara. It has beenenacted in- exercise of the legislative power conferred by the Government of India Act, 1935, Seventh Schedule,List II, "" For making laws regarding intoxicating liquors, i.e., the production, manufacture, possession, transport,purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors "", and under power conferred for raising "" duties of excise on alcoholicliquors for human consumption. "" The pith and substance of the regula- tion is that it raises excise revenue byimposing duties on liquor and intoxicating drugs by diﬀerent methods and it also regulates the import, export,transport, manufacture, sale and possession of intoxicating liquors. Section 13 enacts that no excisable article shallbe manufactured or collected except under the authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a licencegranted in that behalf.Section 14 provides that the excise commissioner may (a) establish a distillery in which spirit may be manufacturedunder a licence granted under section 13 on such conditions as the Chief, Commissioner may impose; (b)discontinue any such distillery; (c) license, on such conditions as the Chief Commissioner may impose, theconstruction and working of a distillery or brewery; (d) establish or license a warehouse wherein any excisablearticle may be deposited-and kept without payment of duty; and (e) discontinue any such warehouse. Section 15provides that without the sanction of the Chief Commissioner no excisable article shall be removed from anydistillery, brewery, warehouse or other place of storage. Section 18 says that the Chief Commissioner may lease toan person, on such conditions and for such period as he may think ﬁt, the right of 'manufacturing or of supplyingby wholesale, or of both, or 878 of selling by wholesale or by retail, or of manufacturing or of supplying by whole,or of both and of selling by retail any country liquor or intoxicating drug within any speciﬁed area. Restrictionsregarding the manufacture and sale of liquors in cantonments and other places are found in some other provisionsof the regulation. The employment of children and women is prohibited in this business and provision is madeauthorising the District Magistrate for closing shops 'for the sake of maintenance of public peace.Section 24 authorises the Chief Commissioner to impose a duty at such rate or rates as he thinks ﬁt on anyexcisable article imported, exported, transported or manufactured, cultivated or collected under any licencegranted under section 13. Section 27 deals with grant of licences, permits and passes. It provides that a licenceshall be granted on payment of such fees, if any, for such period and subject to such restrictions and on suchconditions and shall be in such form and contain such particulars as the Chief Commissioner may direct eithergenerally or in any particular instance. Power is then given by section 30 for cancellation or suspension of thelicence. Sections 31 and 32 provide for the withdrawal and surrender of licence.Chapter VII of the regulation deals with oﬀences and penalties. Chapter VIII deals with detection, investigation andtrial of oﬀences under the regulation. Section 62 provides, inter alia, that the Chief Commissioner has power tomake rules prescribing the scale of fees and the manner of ﬁxing the. fees payable in respect of any privilege,licence, permit or pass or the storing of any excisable article. Section 64 says that the following moneys, namely,all excise revenue, any loss that may accrue when 'in con- sequence of default a grant has been taken undermanagement by the Collector or has been resold by him, and all amounts due to the Government by any personon account of any contract relating to the excise revenue, may be recovered from the person primarily liable to paythe same, or from his, surety (if any), by distress and sale of his movable property, or by any other process for therecovery of land 879 revenue due from landholders or from farmers of land or their sureties.Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to practise any pro. fession or tocarry on any occupation or trade or business, and clause (6) of the article authorises legislation which imposesreasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of the general public. It was not disputed that in order todetermine the reasonableness of the restriction regard must be had to the nature of the. business and theconditions prevailing in that trade. It is obvious that these factors must diﬀer from trade to trade and no hard andfast rules concerning all trades can be laid down. It can also not ,be denied that the State has the power to prohibittrades which are illegal or immoral or injurious to the health and welfare of the public. Laws prohibiting trades inwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 2.html/02095959535 9/12/2COOVERJEE B. BHARUCHA V. THE EX CISE COMMISSIONER AND THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER [14] INSC 2; AIR 14 SC …noxious or dangerous goods or traﬃcking in women cannot be held to be illegal as enacting a prohibition and not amere regulation. The nature of the business is, therefore, an important element in deciding the reasonableness ofthe restrictions. The right of every citizen to pursue any lawful trade or business is obviously subject to suchreasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the country essential to the safety, health,peace, order and morals of the community. Some occupations by the noise made in their pursuit, some by theodors they engender, and some by the dangers accompanying them, require regulations as to the locality in whichthey may be conducted. Some, by the dangerous character of the articles used, manufactured or sold, require alsospecial qualiﬁcations in the parties permitted to use, manufacture or sell them. These pro positions were notdisputed, but it was urged that there was something wrong in principle and objectionable in similar restrictionsbeing applied to the business of selling by retail, in small quantities, spirituous and intoxicating liquors. It wasurged that ,their sale should be without restriction, that every person has a right which inheres in him, a natural880 right to carry on trade in intoxicating liquors and that the State had no right to create a monopoly in them.This contention stands answered by What Field J. said in Crowley v. Christensen(1):""There is in this position an assumption of a fact which does not exist, that when the liquors are taken in excess theinjuries are conﬁned to the party oﬀending. The injury, it is true, ﬁrst falls upon him in his health, which the habitundermines; in his morals, which it weakens;and in the self-abasement which it creates. But as it leads to neglect of business and waste of property and generaldemoralisation, it aﬀects those who are immediately connected with and dependent upon him. By the generalconcurrence of opinion of every civilized and Christian community, there are few sources of crime and misery tosociety equal to the dram shop, where intoxicating liquors, in small quantities, to be drunk at the time, are soldindiscriminately to all parties applying. The statistics of every State show a greater amount of crime and miseryattributable to the use of ardent spirits obtained at these retail liquor saloons than to any other source. The sale ofsuch liquors in this way has therefore, been, at all times, by the courts of every State, considered as the propersubject of legislative regulation. Not -only may a licence be exacted from the keeper of the saloon before a glass ofhis liquors can be thus disposed of, but restrictions may be imposed as to the class of persons to whom they maybe sold, and the hours of the day, and the days of the week, on which the saloons may be opened. Their sale inthat form may be absolutely prohibited. It is a question of public expediency and public morality, and not of federallaw. The police power of the State is fully competent to regulate the business to mitigate its evils or to suppress itentirely.There is no inherent right in a citizen to thus sell intoxicating liquors by retail; it is not a privilege of a citizen of theState or of a citizen of the United States.As it is a business attended with danger to the community, it may, as already said, be entirely prohibited, or be (1)[ 1890] USSC 225; 34 Law. Ed. 620, 623.881 permitted under such conditions as will limit to the utmost its evils. The manner and extent of regulation restin the discretion of the governing authority. That authority may vest in such oﬃcers as it may deem proper thepower of passing upon applications for permission to carry it on, and to issue licences for that purpose. It is amatter of legislative will only."" These observations have our entire concurrence and they completely negative thecontention raised on behalf of the petitioner. The provisions of the regulation purport to regulate trade' in liquor inall its diﬀerent spheres and are valid.The contention that the eﬀect of some of these provisions is to enable Government to confer monopoly rights onone or more persons to the exclusion of others and that creation of such monopoly rights could not be sustainedunder article 19 (6) is again without force. Reliance was placed on the decision in Rashid Ahmad v. Municipal Boardof Kairana(1).That decision is no authority for the Proposition contended for. Elimination and exclusion from business is inherentin the nature of liquor business and it will hardly be proper to apply to such a business principles applicable totrades which all could carry. The provisions of the regulation cannot be attacked merely on the ground that theycreate a monopoly. Properly speaking,, there can be a monopoly only when a trade which could be carried on by allpersons is entrusted by law to one or more persons to the exclusion of the general public. Such, however, is not thecase with the business of liquor. Reference in this connection may be made to the observations of Lord Porter inCommonwealth of Australia v. Bank of New South Wales(2). This is what his Lordship said:www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 2.html/02095959545 9/12/2COOVERJEE B. BHARUCHA V. THE EX CISE COMMISSIONER AND THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER [14] INSC 2; AIR 14 SC …""Yet about this as about every other proposition in this ﬁeld a reservation must be made. For their Lordships donot intend to lay it down that in no circumstances would exclusion of competition so as to (1) (1950) S.C.J. 324. (2)[ 1950] A.C. 235.114 882 create a monopoly either in a State or Commonwealth agency or in some other body be justiﬁed. Everycase must be judged on its own facts and in its own setting of time.Further it seems to us that this argument suﬀers 'from a fallacy. Under the rules every member of the public whowishes to carry on trade in liquor is invited to make bids.This is the only method by which carrying on of liquor trade can be regulated. When the contract is thrown open topublic auction, it cannot be said that there is exclusion of competition and thereby a monopoly is created. For allthese reasons we are of opinion that the contention that the provisions of the regulation are unconstitutional asthey abridge the rights of the petitioner to carry on liquor trade freely cannot be sustained.The next contention that the charge of fee by public auction is excessive and is not in the nature of a fee but a taxignores the fact that licence fee described as a licence fee is more in the nature of a tax than a licence fee. One ofthe purposes of the regulation is to raise revenue. By the provisions of section 24, duties can be imposed on themanufacture, import, export and transport of liquor and other excisable articles. Revenue is also collected by thegrant of contracts to carry on' trade in liquors and these contracts are sold by auction. The grantee is given alicence on payment of the auction price. The regulation speciﬁcally authorises this. It is not a fee levied withoutauthority of law as was the situation in Rashid Ahmad's case(1).As regards the other contentions of the learned counsel, it is suﬃcient to say that if there has been any breach ofthe rules framed under the regulation by the oﬃcers concerned, the remedy for such breaches is provided for inthe regulation itself. Mere irregularities committed in conducting an auction sale cannot be said to have abridgedthe petitioner's fundamental rights and so article 32 is not attracted. It is open to the petitioner under article 226 toI approach the- High Court for a mandamus if the oﬃcers concerned have (1) [ 1950] S.C.J. 324.883 conducted themselves not in accordance with law or if they have acted in excess of their jurisdiction. The sameis the answer to the petitioner's next contention that the sale could not be conﬁrmed by the Minister and thatunder the rules it was only the Chief Commissioner who was authorised to conﬁrm it. Then point of discriminationwas not seriously argued before us.For the reasons given above we see no validity in this application and we accordingly dismiss it with costs.Petition dismissed.Agent for the petitioner: S.

Thesubstance is more important than the form and if there is substantial compliance with the spirit and substance ofthe law, an unessential defect- in form should not be allowed to defeat what is otherwise a proper and validresolution. As in the present case, there was actual appearance without objection at meetings properly convenedand there was complete unanimity on both occasions the two resolutions were not invalid because whatever maybe thought about each taken separately, the defects, if any, are cured when two are read together and regarded asa whole.Held further, that in a mandamus petition the High Court cannot constitute itself into a court of appeal from theauthority against which appeal is sought. It is not the function of courts of law to substitute their wisdom anddiscretion for that of the persons to whose judgment the matter in question is entrusted. by the law.The present was not the sort of case in which a mandamus ought to issue.Radha Kishan Jaikishan v.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This appeal arises out of a petition made bycertain students of the Utkal University of Orissa 885 to the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack seeking a mandamusunder article 226 of the Constitution against the Vice- Chancellor of the University and certain other personsconnected with it.In view of an undertaking given before us on behalf of the University, the questions at issue lose most of theirpractical importance and only two questions of principle remain. Because of this we do not intend to examine thematters which arise at any length.The facts are as follows. The ﬁrst M.B.B.S. Exa. mination of the University included Anatomy as one of its subjects.This examination was divided into three parts. The theoretical portion, which was written, was ﬁxed for the 9thand 10th of April, 1951. The practical was ﬁxed for the 19th and the viva voce for the 20th.At 7 o'clock on the morning of the 9th, before the examination began, a member of the Senate was told that therehad been a leakage of the questions and' he was given a paper which was entitled ""hints"". He at once contactedthree other members of the Senate and handed over copies of these ""hints"" to them. The three members were Mr.Justice Jagannadhadas Mr. Pradhan, the Director of Public Instruction in Orissa, and Mr. Lingaraj Misra, theMinister for Education. The Vice-Chancellor was not informed at the time and no further action was taken. Theexamination proceeded as scheduled on the date,, ﬁxed.The Vice-Chancellor was informed on the 19th. He at once asked Lt. Col. Papatla, the Principal of the MedicalCollege, to look into the matter. This was done and Lt.Col. Papatla submitted a report on the 20th. He compared the ""hints"" with the question paper and considered thatthe similarity between them justiﬁed the conclusion that there had been a leakage.It so happened that an ordinary meeting of the University Syndicate had been called for the 21st to 886 considercertain other matters. This question was not on the agenda but the last item was, ""other matters, if any."" The Vice-Chancellor presided and he told the members present what had happened. He had already prepared a note aboutthis on the 21st before the meeting began. After setting out the facts the note concluded- "" I request the syndicateto discuss the matter as it is an important and urgent one before taking up the publication of the M.B.B.S. resultswhich are also ready, though the subject is not in the agenda.The report of the Board of Examiners setting out the results of the examination was received on the ,morning ofthe 21st some time before the meeting. It showed that thirty seven students had appeared for the examination inquestion. Of these, twenty seven passed and ten failed in the written examination and the same ten, plus oneother (making eleven), failed in the practical and viva voce tests. In the result, eleven of the thirty seven failed andtwenty six passed. The petition for mandamus was made by the twenty six who had passed and eight who failed:thirty four in all.The syndicate heard Lt. Col. Papatla at length and also examined three other persons, namely, Mr. BhairabChandra Mahanty, who ﬁrst gave the information, Dr. R. K. Mahanty, the internal examiner for the M.B.B.S. andDr. 8. M.Banerjee, President of the Board of Examiners. (Two members of the syndicate were experts in Anatomy, namelyLt. Col.Papatla and Dr. S. N. Acharya, the Civil Surgeon).After carefully considering the question for some six hours, the members present passed the following resolution",""" That after enquiry, the syndicate is satisﬁed that there has been leakage of questions in Anatomy and that theresult in Anatomy examination be cancelled and that another examination in the subject be held commencingfrom the 7th May, 1951."" The syndicate consists of twelve members. these, all but one Mr. Pradhan, the Director ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/3.html2/5 9/12/2020THE VICE-CHANCELLOR, UTKALUNIVERSITY & ORS V. S. K. GHOSH & ORS [1954] INSC 3; AIR 1954 SC 217; 1954 SCR 883 (…Public Instruction, were present at the meeting. Those present passed the resolution unanimously. It is admittedthat Mr. Pradhan was not told that this was one of the matters which would be considered at the meeting. This isone of the grounds on which the validity of this resolution is attacked.The successful candidates entered a protest against the resolution and asked the syndicate to reconsider itsdecision. This was on the 26th. The Vice-Chancellor had already called another meeting of the syndicate for the28th to consider other matters. Once again, this was not placed on the agenda but the Vice-Chancellor brought itup suo moto ""as before. Again, eleven of the twelve were present but this time the absentee was Dr. M. Mansinhawho had approved of the previous resolution. The former absentee, Mr.Pradhan, was present at this meeting. For a second time the decision was unanimous and all eleven refused toreview the former resolution. It is admitted that Dr.Manasinha who was not there did not know that this questionwould be considered again.The learned High Court Judges held that the want of notice in the two cases invalidated the resolutions,, Theyexamined the facts for themselves and concluded that even if the evidence is suﬃcient to indicate a a possibility ofsome leakage, there was ""no justiﬁcation for the syndicate to pass such a drastic resolution in the absence of proofof the quantum and the amplitude of leakage."" They held that the syndicate had acted unreasonably and withoutdue care.They therefore issued a mandamus directing the syndicate to take steps for the publication of the results.The Vice-Chancellor and the others appeal.The right of the syndicate to control the examinations, to scrutinise the results, to invalidate an examination forproper reasons and to order a re-examination, when necessary, was not disputed. In view of the undertaking giventhe only points argued were the 888 two which the High Court decided against the University.Several English authorities were cited about the eﬀect of an omission to give notice to even one member of a bodyentitled to receive it, in particular a decision of the Privy Council in Radha Kishan Jaikishan v. MunicipalCommittee, Khandwa(1). We do not think it necessary to examine the general principle at any length because, inour opinion, this case is governed by its own facts. It may well be that when there is a statutory requirement aboutnotice the provisions of the statute cannot be evaded or ignored. It may also be, though we do not stop to enquirewhether it is, that when the constitution of a nonstatutory body requires notice to be given, then also there cannotbe any relaxation of the rule.The reason for the stricter rule laid down in the cases cited before us is that though an incorporated body like anUniversity is a legal entity it has neither living mind nor voice. It can only express its will in formal way by a formalresolution and. so can only act in its corporate capacity by resolutions properly considered, carried and dulyrecorded in the manner laid down by its constitution.If its rules require such resolutions to be moved and passed in a meeting called for the purpose, then everymember of the body entitled to take part in the meeting must be given notice so that he can attend and expresshis views.Individual assents given separately cannot be regarded as equivalent to the assent of a meeting because theincorporated body is diﬀerent from the persons of which it is composed. Hence, an omission to give proper noticeeven to a single member in these circumstances would invalidate the meeting and that in turn would invalidateresolutions which purport to have been passed at it. But this is only when such inﬂexible rigidity is imposed by theincorporating constitution. The position is diﬀerent when, either by custom or by the nature of the body or by itsconstitution and rules, greater latitude and ﬂexibility are permissible. Each (1) 61 I.A. 125.889 case must be governed by its own facts and no universal rule can be laid down; also it may well be that in thesame body certain things, such as routine matters, can be disposed of more easily and with less formality thanothers. It all depends on the nature of the body and its rules.In the present case, there were not one but two meetings.Proper notices of both meetings were issued to all the members including the two absentees. The only defect isthat the matter we are concerned with was not included in the agenda of either meeting. We need not decide herewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/3.html3/5 9/12/2020THE VICE-CHANCELLOR, UTKALUNIVERSITY & ORS V. S. K.

Pulsford(1), La Compagnie De Mayville v.Whitley(1), and Parker and Cooper Ltd. v. Reading(1); also, in the present case one of the items in the agenda ofboth notices was "" other matters, if any. "" But it is not necessary to go into that because in this case thesemembers did in fact attend one or other of the meetings and expressed their views, not individually, but asmembers of a meeting which was considering the matter; and there was unanimity on both occasions Even on thestricter view taken in the cases relied on by counsel it is pointed out that want of due notice can be waived in givencircumstances.Thus, if a person who was not noticed appears at the meeting and waives the irregularity, the defect is cured; soalso when a person is too far away to be reached in time to enable him to communicate with the Committeebefore the meeting: the sending of a notice is then excused. See Radha Kishan Jaikihsan v. Municipal Committee,Khandwa(4) and Young v. Ladies Imperial Club, Lim.(1).

In our opinion, the High Court was wrong in holding that the two resolutions were invalid. Whatever may bethought about each taken separately, the defects, if any, are, in our judgment, cured when the two are readtogether and regarded as a whole.We also think the High Court was wrong on the second point.The learned Judges rightly hold that in a mandamus petition the High Court cannot constitute itself into a court ofappeal from the authority against which the appeal is sought, but having said that they went on to do just whatthey said they could not. The learned Judges appeared to consider that it is not enough to have facts establishedfrom which a leakage can legitimately be inferred by reasonable minds but that there must in addition be proof ofits quantum and amplitude though they do not indicate what the yard-stick of measurement should be. That is apro- position to which we are not able to assent.We are not prepared to perpetrate the error into which the learned High Court Judges permitted themselves to beled and examine the facts for ourselves as a court of appeal but in view of the strictures the High Court has madeon the Vice- Chancellor and the syndicate we are compelled to observe that we do not feel they are justiﬁed. Thequestion was one of urgency and the Vice-Chancellor and the members of the syndicate were well within theirrights in exercising their discretion in the way they did. It may be that the matter could have been handled in someother way, as, for example, in the manner the learned Judges indicate, but it is not the function of courts of law tosubstitute their wisdom and discretion for that of the persons to whose judgment the matter in question isentrusted by the law.The University authorities acted honestly as reasonable and responsible 891 men confronted with an urgentsituation are entitled to act.They had experts of their own on their body. They examined others who in their opinion, might throw light on theincident. They themselves compared the two papers and, after a deliberation of some six hours, arrived at anunanimous decision and then they reviewed the matter afresh at a second meeting with the assistance of one oftheir number who was not present on the ﬁrst occasion. It is inaccurate to describe that as haste and unjust towww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/3.html4/5 9/12/2020THE VICE-CHANCELLOR, UTKALUNIVERSITY & ORS V. S. K.

We accordingly set aside the order of the High Court.We now come to the undertaking given on behalf of the Vice- Chancellor. As we have observed, the syndicatereached the conclusion that there had been a leakage and so cancelled the examinations and ordered fresh ones.Had the High Court not stepped in, those examinations would have been held nearly two and a half years ago andit is possible that all the students who were successful then would have passed again, or at any rate many of themwould. But because of the High Court's order the examinations could not be held and the University was virtuallydirected to regard the examinations already held and the results already declared as good. The result has beenthat the students who passed have been studying and sitting for examinations in the higher classes for some twoand a half 'years. If the status quo which would result from our setting aside of the High Court's order were to beresumed it would mean that those students would be put back to where they were two and a half years ago andwould be compelled to do the courses which they have already covered all over again. In order to avoid suchinjustice we were told at the outset by counsel on behalf of the Vice-Chancellor that the University did not want topenalise them and so gave us the following undertaking drafted by the appellants' counsel:"" The students who are declared to have passed the ﬁrst M.B.B.S. Examination of the Utkal University 892 held inApril, 1951, shall be deemed to have duly passed that examination and shall not be required to appear again inAnatomy. "" The appeal is allowed.

C. Isaacs (Amar Nath Chona, with him) for the respondents.1954. January 19. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave against theorder made on the 20th November, 1951, by the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh in proceedingsinstituted by the respondents under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.There is no substantial dispute as to the facts leading up to the present appeal. The 'appellants 567 were tenants ofa certain shop premises situate in Solan Bazar in the district of Mahasu in Himachal Pradesh. On the llth October,1947, they had executed a rent deed by which they agreed to pay an annual rent of Rs. 175 payable as to Rs. 50 onthe last of Baisakh and as to the balance of Rs.125 in the month of October, in default of which payment,% the respondents, as landlords, would be entitled torecover the whole of the said rent in one lump sum. The tenancy created by the rent deed was only for one year inthe ﬁrst instance but it provided that if the tenants desired to continue in occupation they must execute a furtherrent deed before the expiration of the said term. The appellants never executed any further rent deed but heldover and continued in occupation of the demised premises.The appellants fell into arrears with the payments of rents due for the years 1948 and 1949 and the respondentsmade applications to the Rent Controller for eviction of the appellants under section 13 (2) (i) of the East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, as extended to Himachal Pradesh.The appellants, however, paid up the arrears of rent into court and claimed the beneﬁt of the proviso to section 13(2) (i). The claim was allowed and the said applications were dismissed accordingly on the 18th December, 1950.The appellants again fell into arrears with the pay- ment of rent due for the year 1950. On the 26th December,1950, the respondents served on the appellants a notice c alling upon the latter to pay whole of the said rentforthwith but the appellants failed to do so. The respondents thereupon, on the 2nd January, 1951, ﬁled anapplication under section 13 (2) (i) for the eviction of the appellants on the ground of nonpayment of rent.Thereafter, on the 10th January, 1951, the appellants made an application to the Rent Controller for the ﬁxation ofa fair rent under section 4 of the said Act.On the 25th January, 1951, the appellants ﬁled their written statements in the proceedings under section 13 568 (2)(i) admitting the nonpayment of rent and the receipt of the notice but pleaded (i) that the respondents' applicationwas barred by reason of the rejection of the previous applications for eviction made by the respondents and (ii)that the present application could not be entertained in view of the pendency of their application for ﬁxation of afair rent under section 4 of the said Act.On the 20th February, 1951, the Rent Controller framed the following issues:- (1) Whether the application inquestion was not entertainable in view of the judgment of the District Judge, dated the 18th December, 1950 Onuson defendants.(2) If issue No. I is not proved, had the opposite party (tenants) not paid the rent and as such were they liable to beejected? Onus on plaintiﬀs.(3) Have the opposite party already ﬁled an application in the said court for the ﬁxation of rent and are they,therefore, not liable for ejectment pending the decision on the application and what is its eﬀect on the saidapplication? Onus on defendants.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/4.html/02095951956959524 9/12/2WARYAM SINGH & ANR V. AMARNA TH & ANR [14] INSC 4; AIR 14 SC 25; 14 SCR 55 (19 January 14)By his judgment, dated the 29th May, 1951, the Rent Controller held that as the previous applications related tonon-payment of rents for the years 1948 and 1949 the present application which was founded on non-payment ofrent for 1950 was not barred under section 14 of the said Act but, although the fact of rent being in arrears wasadmitted, the Rent Controller did not think ﬁt to make an order directing the appellants to put the respondents inpossession of the demised premises. The reasons given by him were as follows:- "" Regarding the non-payment ofthe rent when the plea of the tenant is only that he is waiting for the ﬁxation of fair rent by the Rent Controllerthere is not enough ground for ejectment. A civil suit for the recovery of the rent would have been a moreappropriate method of obtaining that rent.I therefore dismiss the suit.' The parties should bear their own 569 The respondents preferred an appeal to theDistrict Judge of Mahasu under section 15 of the said Act. The learned District Judge dismissed the appealobserving- ""On behalf of the landlord it was urged that under section 13 (2) of the Punjab Urban Rent RestrictionAct, as applied to Himachal Pradesh, the Controller, if it came to the ﬁnding that rent had not been paid, had nooption but to direct the tenant to put the landlord in possession.Undoubtedly, that is the correct legal position, but in the present case the non-payment of rent was due to amisapprehension of the legal position created by the tenant ﬁling an application for ﬁxing fair rent. 1, therefore,think that this case can be distinguished and does not fall within section 13 (2), Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act.""The respondents moved the Judicial Commissioner, Himachal Pradesh, under articles 226 and 227 of theConstitution of India for setting aside the order of the District Judge.The learned Judicial Commissioner held that in view of the admitted failure to pay the rent as provided by the rentdeed or at the ﬁrst hearing of the court under the proviso to section 13 (2) (i) the courts below had acted arbitrarilyin refusing to make an order for ejectment against the tenants who had not done what was incumbent on them todo under the law and that such a situation called for inter- ference by the court of the Judicial Commissioner inorder to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds of their authority. He accordingly set aside the orders ofthe courts below and allowed the application for ejectment but gave the appelants three months' time for vacatingthe premises. The appellants have now come up before this court on appeal by special leave obtained from thiscourt.Learned advocate appearing in support of this appeal urges that the learned Judicial Commissioner acted whollywithout jurisdiction inasmuch as (1) the Rent Controller or the District Judge exercising powers 570 under the Actwas not amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court and, therefore, article 227 confers no power on the court ofthe Judicial Commissioner over the Rent Controller or the District Judge, and (2) that article 227 read with article241 confers no power of judicial superintendence on the court of the Judicial Commissioner.Re. l.-The court of the Judicial Commissioner of Himachal Pradesh exercises jurisdiction in relation to the whole ofthe territories of Himachal Pradesh. The Rent Controller and the District Judge exercising jurisdiction under theAct are certainly tribunals, if not courts, and they function within the territories of Himachal Pradesh. Therefore,article 297 (1) read with article 241 confers on the court of the Judicial Commissioner power of superintendenceover such tribunals. The words "" in relation to which "" obviously qualify the word "" territories "" and not the words""courts and tribunals"".Re. 2.The material part of article 227 substantially reproduces the provisions of section 107 of the Government ofIndia Act, 1915, except that the power of superintendence has been extended by the article also to tribunals. Thatthe Rent Controller and the District Judge exercising jurisdiction under the Act are tribunals cannot and has notbeen controverted. The only question raised is as to the nature of the power of superintendence conferred by thearticle. Reference is made to clause (2) of the article in support of the contention that this article only confers onthe High Court administrative superintendence over the subordinate courts and tribunals. We are unable to acceptthis contention because clause ( 2) is, expressed to be without prejudice to the.generality of the provisions inclause (1). Further, the preponderance of judicial opinion in India was that section 107 which was similar in terms tosection 15 of the High Courts Act, 1861, gave a power of judicial superintendence to the High Court apart from andindependently of the provisions of other laws conferring revisional jurisdiction on the High Court. In thisconnection it has to 571 be remembered that section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915, was reproduced inthe Government of India Act, 1935, as section 224. Section 224 of the 1935 Act, however, introduced sub-section(2), which was new, providing that nothing in the section should be construed as giving the High Court anyjurisdiction to,question any judgment of any inferior court which was not otherwise subject to appeal or revision.The idea presumably was to nullify the eﬀect of the decisions of the diﬀerent High Courts referred to above.Section 224 of the 1935 Act has been reproduced with certain modiﬁcations in article 227 of the Constitution.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/4.html/02095951956959534 9/12/2WARYAM SINGH & ANR V. AMARNA TH & ANR [14] INSC 4; AIR 14 SC 25; 14 SCR 55 (19 January 14)It is signiﬁcant to note that sub-section (2) to section 224, of the 1935 Act has been omitted from article 227.This signiﬁcant omission has been regarded by all High Courts in India before whom this question has arisen Ashaving restored to the High Court the power of judicial superintendence it had under section 15 of the High CourtsAct, 186 1, and section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915. See the cases referred to in -Moti Lal v. The Statethrough Shrimati Sagrawati(1). Our attention has not been drawn to any case which has taken a diﬀerent viewand, as at present advised, we see no reason to take a diﬀerent view.This power of superintendence conferred by article 227 is, as pointed out by Harries C. J., in Dalmia Jain AirwaysLtd.v. Sukumar Mukherjee(2), to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases in order to keep theSubordinate Courts within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere errors. As rightly pointed outby the Judicial Commissioner in the case before us the lower courts in refusing to make an order for ejectmentacted arbitrarily. The lower courts realised the legal position but in eﬀect declined to do what was by section 13 (2)(i) incumbent on them to do and thereby refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in them by law. It. was, therefore, acase which called for an interference by the court of the Judicial Commissioner and it acted (1) I.L.R. [ 1952] 1 All.558 at p. 567, (2) A.I.R. 1951 Cal. 193.75 572 quite properly in doing so. In our opinion there is no ground on which in an appeal by special leave underarticle 136 we should interfere. The appeal, therefore, must stand dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.Agent for the appellants: M. M. Sinha. Agent for the respondent: K. L. Mehta."

Sub-section (4) provides that notwithstanding anything contained in section85, the tribunal may dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of sections 81, 83 or117.It is signiﬁcant that both the Election Commission and the tribunal have been given powers in express 116 898terms to dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the requirements of sections 81, 83 or 117, but nosuch powers are given to dismiss a petition in limine which does not comply with the provisions of section 82. Sucha petition can only be dismissed at the conclusion of the trial and on grounds suﬃcient to dismiss it (section 98).Speciﬁc provisions have been made to ensure that allegations of corrupt practice etc. are not lightly or frivolouslymade by providing that the petition must be.properly veriﬁed and the allegations contained therein stated with a certain amount of deﬁniteness and accuracyand it is an express provision of Part VI itself that the procedure of the tribunal is to be governed by the Code ofCivil Procedure and where a petition complies with sections 81, 83 or 117, the Commission is bound to refer thepetition to an election tribunal and the tribunal, unless it is of the opinion that the petition is not in accordancewith sections 81, 83 or 117, is bound to try it and decide it according to the provisions of law.Provision has been made in section 90 (1) for any other candidate subject to the provisions of section 119, to havehimself impleaded as a party in the case within a prescribed period. This provision indicates that the array of.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/5.h/02095951959nuar95wwwiiofindirasee95tml36 9/12/2JAGAN NATH V. JASW ANT SINGH & ORS [14] INSC 5; AIR 14 SC 20; 14 SCR 82 ( 20 Jay 14)parties as provided by section 82 is not ﬁnal and conclusive and that defects can be cured. Provisions of sections110, 115 and 116 of Chapter IV of this Part also support this view.Section,110 provides the procedure for the withdrawal of a petition. It says that any person who might himselfhave been a party may within 14 days of the publication of the notice of withdrawal in the oﬃcial gazette apply tobe substituted as a petitioner in the place of the party withdrawing it. Section 115 provides that such a person canbe substituted as a petitioner on the death of the original petitioner while section 116 provides that if a solerespondent dies or gives notice that he does not wish to oppose the petition or any of the respondents dies orgives such notice and there is no other respondent who is appearing in the petition, the tribunal shall 899 causenotice of such event to be published in the oﬃcial gazette and thereupon any person who might have been apetitioner may within 14 days of such publication apply to be substituted in the place of such respondent andoppose the petition and shall be entitled to continue the proceedings on such terms as the tribunal may think ﬁt.These provisions suggest that if any proper party is omitted from the lists of respondents, such a defect is not fataland the tribunal is entitled to deal with it under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, Order I, rules 9, 10and 13.Baijnath was a candidate who had withdrawn his candidature and had not contested the election. By reason of hisabsence or presence having regard to the grounds on which the petition was based no prejudice was likely to resultto the respondent No. I because the main ground on which the petition was based was that the petitioner'snomination paper had been wrongly rejected. Baijnath did not claim that he had acquired any substantive rightsby reason of the failure of the petitioner to implied him within the period prescribed and there is no question ofdepriving him of any such rights. In our opinion, the tribunal rightly disallowed the preliminary objection.Mr. Chatterjee, the learned counsel for the appellant, drew our attention to certain decisions given by the diﬀerentelection tribunals constituted under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in support of his contention. On acareful perusal of the diﬀerent decisions given by the various election tribunals it appears that there is nouniformity of opinion between them on this point.Conﬂicting opinions have been expressed by these tribunals.It is unnecessary to discuss all these decisions in detail.It will be suﬃcient to say. that we are in entire agreement with those decisions which have held that non-compliance with the provisions of section 82 is not fatal to the petition. The matter has to be determined inaccordance with the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure which have Is been made expressly applicable.Mr. Chatterjee laid emphasis on the decision of the Election Tribunal, Lucknow, presided over by 900 Shri N. S.,Lokur in Election Petition No. 287 of 1952 published in the Gazette of India dated 20th December, 1951, Part 11,Section 3, page 1034. In that case two persons who had been duly nominated as candidates but who hadwithdrawn their candidature were not impleaded as respondents as required by section 82 of the Representationof the People Act, 1951 It was held that the non-joinder was fatal ,to the petition. It was said that the wording ofthe Act is peremptory and mandatory and it makes it incumbent on the petitioner to join as respondents allcandidates duly nominated and it gives him no option and the failure to do so involves rejection of the petition.Reliance was placed on certain decisions of Election Tribunals given under the election rules in force under theGovernment of India Act, 1935, and the decision of another Election Tribunal, Quilon, in Sri Ramchandra Nair v. SriRamehandra Das reproduced At page 2396e, Gazette of India Extraordinary, Part I, Section 1, dated the llth ofNovember, 1952. It was said that unless all the requirements of rules 81, 82 and 83 are complied with the electioncannot be questioned. As regards the omission of section 82 from the provisions of section 85, it was observedthat the Election Commission can at once discover whether the provisions of sections 81, 83 and 117 are compliedwith but the same cannot be said about the requirements of section 82 and that the Election, Commission willhave to hold an inquiry as to who were the candidates duly nominated before determining whether all of them hadbeen joined or not, that this burden of inquiry was not thrown on the Commission but it was left for thedetermination of the tribunal, and hence it was that section 82 was not included in section 85.Both the reasons given by the tribunal cannot, in our opinion, be sustained. The provisions of section 82 are interms similar to the provisions of Order XXXIV, rule I of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therein it is provided that allpersons having an interest either in the mortgage security or in the right of redemption shall be joined as parties toany suit relating to the 901 mortgage. There is ample authority for the view that this is merely a directory provision.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/5.h/02095951959nuar95wwwiiofindirasee95tml46 9/12/2JAGAN NATH V. JASW ANT SINGH & ORS [14] INSC 5; AIR 14 SC 20; 14 SCR 82 ( 20 Jay 14)and non-joinder of any party is not a fatal defect and a decree can be passed so far as the parties actually on recordare concerned unless the party omitted is a necessary party in the sense that in his absence no relief could be givenat all even as regards parties actually on record. There is no valid reason for treating the word ""shall"" in section 82in a manner diﬀerent from the same word used in Order XXXIV, rule 1, Civil Procedure Code. It is one of the rules ofconstruction that a provision like this is not mandatory unless non-compliance with it is made penal. As regardsthe dictum of the Lucknow Tribunal that no inquiry is required to be made in the case of non-compliance with theprovisions of sections 81, 83 and 117 but that an inquiry would be necessary to determine whether certain partieswere nominated candidates or not, in our opinion it cannot stand scrutiny. Whether a petition has been presentedby a person who has purported to sign it or by someone else or whether an agent who has signed the petition is aduly authorized agent or not are its much matters of inquiry as the question of determination of the names ofnominated candidates. This fact can be easily determined by reference to the Returning Oﬃcer. That thisreasoning of the tribunal is not sound is fully demonstrated by a reference to the next case cited by the learnedcounsel and decided by the same tribunal presided over by Shri N. S. Lokur. In that case the question arosewhether the petition was duly veriﬁed and whether it was accompanied by all the necessary lists required bysection 83 (2). An elaborate inquiry had to be conducted to' determine the point whether the petition was typed onblank paper signed by the petitioner or whether it was signed by him or some person authorized on his behalf afterit had been typed. It is thus clear that it is no valid explanation to say that section 82 was omitted from theprovisions of section 85 simply on the ground that the Election Commission was absolved from the duty of makingelaborate inquiries at the stage when it had to say whether the provisions of sections 81, 83 and 902 117 had beencomplied with. From the circumstance that section 82 does not ﬁnd a place in the provisions of section 85 theconclusion follows that the directions contained in section 82 were not considered to be of such a character as toinvolve the dismissal of a petition in limine and that the matter was such as could be dealt with by the tribunalunder the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure speciﬁcally made applicable to the trial of election petitions.The Bombay Tribunal, presided over by Shri B. D. Nandkarni has taken a contrary view in Election Petition No. 72of 1952, page 286, Gazette of India Extraordinary, dated the 5th February, 1953. The issue in this case was whetherShri T. C. Patil, was a necessary party and -whether by the omission to implead him the whole petition was bad.The tribunal held that the defect was not fatal.In another case, Petition No. 113 of 1952, decided on 28th July, 1953, the majority of the Bombay Tribunal, decidedotherwise. The view of the majority was that the mandatory nature of the provisions of section 82 itself containswithin it the -consequence of dismissal for non-compliance with its provisions and a separate provision for thedismissal of the petition for non-compliance with its provisions was not necessary and it would have beensuperﬂuous. These observations run counter to the scheme of the Act itself as envisaged by section 85. Theprovisions of sections 81, 83 and 117 are also mandatory and still in section 85 it is provided in speciﬁc terms thatthe Election Commission shall dismiss the petition if it is not in accordance with the provisions of those sections.The, tribunal is given a similar power by section 90 (4).The member of the tribunal who dissented from the majority view gave cogent and sound reasons for holding thatnon- joinder of a duly nominated candidate who has withdrawn was not necessarily fatal to the petition.In Election Petition No. 83 of 1952 decided by the Election Tribunal presided over by Shri B. C. Vakil, the tribunaltook the view that such a defect was fatal. A Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Special 903 Civil AppealNo. 2017 of 1952, decided on the 19th of December, 1952, allowed even a defective veriﬁcation to be amended. Itis not necessary to express any ﬁnal opinion on matters speciﬁcally covered by sections 81, 83 and 117 and dealtwith by section 85 of the Act but at the same time it is not possible to accept the view 'that in spite of theprovisions of section 85 failure to comply strictly with the provisions of section 82 has, the same consequences asare contained in section 85. In our opinion the determination of the question whether the parties to the petitionhave been properly impleaded is a matter not for the Election Commission but for the tribunal. Various provisionsof the Act referred to above show that the election petition does not necessarily abate or fail by reason of thedeath of the petitioner or any of the respondents or by their ceasing to take any interest in the trial of the petitiononce that petition has been referred to the tribunal. On the other hand, any person who could be a petitioner cancontinue the petition in spite of the death of either the petitioner or the respondents to the petition and on theoriginal parties failing to prosecute it. These provisions have been made to ensure that the election process onwhich the democratic system of Government is based is not abused or misused by any candidate and that inquiryis not shut out by collusion between persons made parties to the petition or by their respective deaths. It istherefore clear that the provisions of the law relating to the impleading of parties are not necessarily fatal and can.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/5.h/02095951959nuar95wwwiiofindirasee95tml56 9/12/2JAGAN NATH V.

It is for the tribunal to determine the matter as and when it arises in accordance with the provisions ofthe Code of Civil Procedure.For the reasons given above we are of the opinion that the decisions of the tribunal and of the High Court in thiscase were right.

JASW ANT SINGH & ORS [14] INSC 5; AIR 14 SC 20; 14 SCR 82 ( 20 Jay 14)The appellant Jagan Nath was elected a member of the Delhi State Legislative Assembly from Constituency No. 25(Roshanara) of the Delhi State. The polling in this constituency took place on the 14th January, 1952. On the 26thApril, 1952, which was the last date under the law for the presentation of an election petition, Jaswant Singh(respondent No. 1) presented such a petition before the Secretary of the Election Commission at New Delhichallenging the election of the appellant and contesting the order of the Returning Oﬃcer rejecting hisnomination paper. In the petition he impleaded as respondents, Brahma Sarup, Ram Prashad Poddar and theappellant, Jagan Nath, but he omitted to implead, as required by section 82 of the Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951, Baijnath, one of the candidates, whose nomination had been accepted but who had withdrawn hiscandidature subsequently.On the 14th July, 1952, the Election Commissioner appointed an Election Tribunal comprising respondents 5 to 7.This appointment was published in the Gazette of India on the 26th July, 1952, and the election petition after duepublication was referred to the tribunal. On the 26th August, 1952, which was the ﬁrst date of hearing before thetribunal, the appellant raised a preliminary objection that the omission to implead Baijnath, a duly nominatedcandidate as a respondent in the petition.- was fatal to its 894 maintainability. The petitioner contended thatBaijnath was neither a necessary nor a proper party and that in any event the non-joinder of a party. was not fatalto the petition in view of the provisions of Order 1, rule 9, Civil Procedure Code. In the alternative, it was claimedthat if it was considered that he was a necessary or proper party, permission may be given to the petitioner toimplead him.The tribunal decided the preliminary point in favour of the petitioner and held that the non-joinder of Baijnath as arespondent was not fatal to the petition. On the ﬁnding, however, that Baijnath was a proper party to beimpleaded in the case, the tribunal directed that he added as a respondent in the petition and notice of thepetition be served on him. In the view of the tribunal Baijnath was not a necessary party in the sense that in hisabsence no eﬀective decision could be given in the case and that being a proper party, there was no obstacle to hisbeing joined as a respondent even after the expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for making the petition.The appellant being dissatisﬁed with this decision, made an application to the Punjab High Court under articles226 and 227.of the Constitution of India for the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the order of the tribunal on theground that it was without jurisdiction and for an order that the election petition be dismissed as there was novalid petition before the Election Tribunal for trial. This petition was summarily rejected by the High Court on the27th November, 1952. On a petition presented to this court under article 136 of the Constitution, special leave wasgranted by this court.In this appeal it was contended before us that the Election Tribunal was not a court of general jurisdiction, that itwas established by the Representation of the People Act, 1951, for the special purpose of trying election petitions,that its jurisdiction was derived from the statute upon certain speciﬁed terms and conditions precedent containedin the statute itself and that it had no general and inherent powers of an 895 existing court and that being so, if theterms and conditions precedent prescribed by the statute were not complied with, it had no jurisdiction to act.According to the appellant, the scheme of the Act was that no election could be called in question except by anelection petition presented in accordance with the provisions of Part VI of the Act (section 80), and it wassuggested that unless all the requirements of sections 81, 82, 83 and 117 were complied with, an election could notbe questioned and that no subsequent addition or amendment of the petition after the expiry of the 14 daysprescribed for presenting a petition was permissible. It was further contended that the provisions of section 82were explicit and mandatory and admitted of no exceptions and the petition not being in accordance with theprovisions of the law, there was no valid petition which the tribunal could proceed to try.Lastly, it was contended that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure were applicable to the trial of petitionsbut could not be of assistance in determining whether a petition had been validly presented.The general rule is well settled that the statutory requirements of election law must be strictly observed and thatan election contest is not an action at law or a suit in equity but is a purely statutory proceeding unknown to thecommon law and that the court possesses no common law power. It is also well settled that it is a sound principleof natural justice that the success of a candidate who has won at an election should not be lightly interfered withand any petition seeking such interference must strictly conform to the requirements of the law. None of thesepropositions however have any application if the special law itself confers authority on a tribunal to proceed with apetition in accordance with certain procedure and when it does not state the consequences of non-compliancewith certain procedural requirements laid down by it. It is always to be borne in mind that though the election of asuccessful candidate is not to be lightly interfered with, one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/5.h/02095951959nuar95wwwiiofindirasee95tml26 9/12/2JAGAN NATH V.

In cases where the election law does not prescribe the consequence, or does not lay downpenalty for non-compliance with certain procedural requirements of that law, the jurisdiction of the tribunalentrusted with the trial of the case is not aﬀected.It is in these circumstances necessary to set out the diﬀerent provisions of the Act relevant to the mattercanvassed before us.Part VI of the Act deals with ""Disputes regarding Elections."" Chapter I of this Part is the deﬁnition chapter. Chapter11 consists of six sections. Section 80 provides that no election on shall be called in question except by an electionpetition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part. Section 81 provides that an election petitioncalling in question any election may be presented on one or more of the grounds speciﬁed in Sub- sections (1) and(2) of sections 100 and 101 to the Election Commission by any candidate at such election or any- elector in suchform and within such time but not earlier than the date of publication of the name or names of the returnedcandidate or candidates at such election under section 67, as may be prescribed; that an election petition shall bedeemed to have been presented to the Election Commission_ ""(a) when it is delivered to the Secretary to theCommission or to such other oﬃcer as may be appointed by the Election Commission in this behalf- (i) by theperson making the petition, or (ii) by a person authorized in writing in this behalf by the person making thepetition ; or (b) when it is sent by registered post and is delivered to the Secretary to the Commission or the oﬃcerso appointed."" Section 82 provides as follows:""A petitioner shall join as respondents to his petition all the candidates who were duly nominated at the electionother than himself if he was so nominated."" 897 Section 83 states that an election petition shall contain a concisestatement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies and shall be signed by the petitioner and veriﬁed inthe manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure for the veriﬁcation of pleadings. It further provides that thepetition shall be accompanied by a list signed and veriﬁed in like manner setting forth full particulars of any corruptor illegal practice which the petitioner alleges, including as full a statement as possible of the names of the partiesalleged to have committed such corrupt or illegal practice and the date and place of the commission of each suchpractice. Provision is also made in the section empowering the tribunal to obtain further particulars by allowing anamendment. Section 84 concerns the relief which a petitioner may claim, and section 85 provides that if theprovisions of sections 81, 83 or 117 are not complied with, the Election Commission shall dismiss the petition.Power is however given to the Commission to condone delay in making the petition for suﬃcient cause.Chapter III of Part VI deals with the trial of election petitions. It consists of 21 sections. Section 86 provides that ifthe petition is not dismissed under section 85, the Election Commission shall appoint an election tribunal for thetrial of the petition. Provision, is then made for constituting the' tribunal and the place where the trial should takeplace. Section 90 prescribes the procedure to be followed by the tribunal.

THE INCOME-TAX INVESTIGATION COMMISSION [1954] INSC 6; AIR 1954 SC 207; 1954 SCR 738 (22 January 1954).pdf,"The Punjab High Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ under art. 226 of the Constitution to the Income-taxInvestigation Commission located in Delhi and investigating the case of the petitioner under 5 of the Taxation onIncome (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, although the petitioners were assessees within the U.P.State and their original assessments were made by the Income-tax authorities of that State.Article 226 of the Constitution confers on all the High Courts new and very wide powers in the matter of issuingwrits which they never possessed before. There are only two limitations placed upon the exercise of such powersby a High Court; one is that the power is to be exercised ""throughout the territories in relation to which it exercisesjurisdiction"", that is to say, the writs issued by the court cannot run beyond the territories subject to its jurisdiction.The other is that the person or authority to whom 739 the High Court is empowered to issue writs ""must be withinthose territories"" and this ,implies that they must be amenable to its jurisdiction either by residence or locationwithin those territories.The remedy provided in art. 226 of the Constitution is a discretionary one and the High Court has always thediscretion to refuse to grant any writ if it is satisﬁed that the aggrieved party can have an adequate or suitablerelief elsewhere.Ryots of Garabandho v.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.--These four consolidated appeals,which have come before us, on a certiﬁcate granted by the High Court of Punjab under article 133 (1)(c)of theConstitution, are directed against one common judgment of a Division Bench of that court dated the 10th August,1950, by which the learned Judges dismissed four analogous petitions, presented on behalf of the diﬀerentappellants, claiming reliefs under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, in respect of certain income-taxinvestigation proceedings commenced against them under Act XXX of 1947. It appears that a partnership ﬁrmcarrying on business under the name and style of K.S. Rashid & Son was started on the 5th of May, 1934, thepartners being three in number to wit K.S.Rashid Ahmed, Saeed Ahmed, his son, and Mrs. Zafar Muhammed, his mother Mrs. Zafar Muhammed died on the7th of January, 1946, and as a result of her death the partnership stood dissolved. Immediately on the dayfollowing, 740 that is to say on the 8th of January, 1946, a new ﬁrm was started bearing the same name, with thetwo surviving partners of the original ﬁrm and one Saeeda Begum, a daughter of K.S. Rashid, as the third partner.On the 31st of December, 71947, the Central Government referred the cases of this ﬁrm, as well as of theindividuals constituting it, to the Income-taxInvestigation Commission for enquiry and report under section 5ofAct XXX of 1947, presumably on the ground that there had been substantial evasion of payment of income-tax inthese cases. The authorised oﬃcial appointed under section 5 (4)(3) of the Act, who ﬁgures as respondent No. 2 inall these appeals, in due course started investigation in these cases and the appellants' complaint is, that contraryto the provisions of the Act, he extended his investigations to a period subsequent to the 31st March, 1943, up towhich date the income-tax assessment in all these cases was completed. A petition embodying this complaint wasmade -to the authorised oﬃcial on the 8th of April, 1949, but no order was passed on the petition, as theCommission was expecting an early change of law in this respect. The law was amended by an Ordinance datedthe 5th of July, 1949, but the appellants still contended that the amendment was neither retrospective in itsoperation, nor did it enable the authorised oﬃcial to carry on his investigation beyond the 31st March, 1943. Theaccount books, however, were shown to the oﬃcial under protest. On the 17th September, 1949, threeapplications were ﬁled before the Commission, one with regard to the aﬀairs of Mrs.Zafar Muhammed stating that no investigation could take place in regard to her as she was already dead;thesecond with regard to the aﬀairs of Saeeda Begum on the ground that she being a new partner and not havingbeen assessed before, was not subject to 'the jurisdiction of the Commission; while the third application was to theeﬀect that the new ﬁrm, which came into existence on the 8th of January, 1946, could not have its aﬀairs enquiredinto at all under the provisions of the Act. After that, in June, 1950, four miscellaneous petitions were ﬁled, (beingC.M. Gases Nos. 259 to 262 741 of 1950) on behalf of the appellants, before the High Court of Punjab, and theprayers made therein were of a three- fold character. It was prayed in the ﬁrst place that a writ of prohibition mightbe issued to the Commission and the authorised oﬃcial directing them not to proceed with the investigation ofcases referred to the Commission under section 5 of Act XXX of 1947. The second prayer was for a writ in thenature of certiorari for quashing the proceedings already commenced. The third and the alternative claim was thatthe proceedings before the Commission might be revised under article 277 of the Constitution and suitable orderspassed as the justice of the case would require. Upon these petitions, rules were issued on the 25th of July, 1950,after a report from the Investigation Commission had been called for. On behalf of the respondents, who resistedthese petitions, certain preliminary points were raised in bar of the petitioners"" claim. It was contended in the ﬁrstplace that the petitioners being assessees belonging to U.P., their assessments were to be made by the Income-taxCommissioner of that State and the mere fact that the location of the Investigation Commission was in Delhiwould not confer jurisdiction upon the Punjab High Court to issue writs under article 226 of the Constitution. Thesecond objection was that the Act itself being of a special nature which created new rights and liabilities, theremedies provided for in the Act itself for any breach or violation thereof were the only remedies which could bewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/6.html/95959539525 9/12/ 2020K.S .

The third ground taken was that the court could not give relief to the petitioners because of sections5(3) and 9 of Act XXX of 1947. These contentions found favour with the learned Judges who heard the petitions,and although they did not express any ﬁnal opinion on the third point raised they dismissed the applications of thepetitioners on the ﬁrst two grounds mentioned above. It is against these orders of dismissal that the presentappeals have been taken to this court and Dr. Tek Chand, who appeared on behalf of the appellants, has assailedthe 742 propriety of the decision of the High Court both the points.So far as the ﬁrst, point is concerned, which relates to the question of jurisdiction of the Punjab High Court to issuewrits of certiorari or prohibition in these cases, the learned Judges based their decision entirely upon thepronouncement of the Judicial Committee in the well known case of Ryots of Garabandho v.' Zamindar ofParlakitnedi(1). The question for consideration in that case was, whether the High Court of Madras had jurisdictionto issue a writ of certiorari in respect of an order passed by the Collective Board of Revenue, as an appellateauthority, in certain proceedings for settlement of rent between the Zamindar of Parlakimedi and the Ryots ofcertain villages within his estate situated in the district of Ganjam which was wholly outside the limits of thePresidency town of Madras. The question was answered in the negative. The Judicial Committee laid down thatthe three Chartered High Courts of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay had powers to issue, what were known as thehigh prerogative writs, as successors to the Supreme Courts which previously exercised jurisdiction over thesePresidency Towns; but the exercise of the powers under the Charter was limited to persons within the ordinaryoriginal civil jurisdiction of the three High Courts, and outside that jurisdiction it extended only to 'British subjects'as deﬁned in the Charter itself. It was held that the Supreme Court of Madras had no jurisdiction under the Charterwhich created it to correct or control a country court of the the East India Company deciding a dispute betweenIndian inhabitants of the Ganjam district about the rent payable for land in that district; and no such power wasgiven by any subsequent legislation to its successor, the High Court . A contention seems to have been raised onbehalf of the appellants that the jurisdiction to issue writs could be rounded on the fact that the oﬃce of the Boardof Revenue, which was the appellate authority in the matter of settlement of rents, was located within the town ofMadras (1) 70 I.A. 129.743 and the order complained of was made in that town and reliance was placed in this connection upon the caseof Nundo Lal Bose v. The Calcutta Corporation (1), where a certiorari was issued by the Calcutta High Court toquash an assessment made by the Commissioners of the town of Calcutta on a certain dwelling house. Thiscontention was repelled by the Judicial 'Committee with the following observations:""The question is whether the principle of that case can be applied in the present case to the settlement of rent forland in Ganjam, merely on the basis of the location of the Board of Revenue, as a body which is ordinarily residentor located within the town of Madras, or on the basis that the order complained of was made within the town. Ifso, it would seem to follow that the jurisdiction of the High Court would be avoided by the removal of the Board ofRevenue beyond the outskirts of the town, and that it would never attach but for the circumstance that an appealis brought to, or proceedings in revision taken by, the Board of Revenue.Their Lordships think that the question of jurisdiction must be regarded as one of substance, and that it would nothave been within the competence of the Supreme Court to claim jurisdiction over such a matter as the present byissuing certiorari to the Board of Revenue on the strength of its location in the town. Such a view would givejurisdiction to the Supreme Court, in the matter of the settlement of rents for ryoti holdings in Ganjam betweenparties not otherwise subject to its jurisdiction, which it would not have had over the Revenue Oﬃcer who dealtwith the matter at ﬁrst instance."" It is on the basis of these observations of the Judicial Committee that the learnedJudges have held that the mere location of the Investigation Commission in Delhi is not suﬃcient to conferjurisdiction upon the Punjab High Court to issue a writ in the present case. It is said that the petitioners areassessees within the U. P State and their original assessments were made by the Income-tax Oﬃcers of that State.(1)I.L.R. II Cal. 275 744 The subsequent proceedings, which had to be taken in pursuance of the report of theInvestigation Commission, would have to b.e taken by the Income-tax authorities in the U.P., and if a case had tobe stated, it would be stated to the High Court at Allahabad. Taking, therefore, as the Privy Council had said, that,the question of jurisdiction is one of substance, it was held that no jurisdiction in the present case could be vestedin the Punjab High Court, for that jurisdiction could be avoided simply by removal of the Commission from Delhi toanother place.This line of reasoning does not appear to us to be proper and we do not think that the decision in the Parlakimedi'scase(1) is really of assistance in determining the question of jurisdiction of the High Courts in the matter of issuingwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/6.html/95959539535 9/12/ 2020K.S . RASHID AND SON V . THE INCOME-T AX INVESTIGATION COMMISSION [14] INSC 6; AIR 14 SC 207; 14 SCR 78 (…writs under article 226 of the Constitution. The whole law on this subject has been discussed and elucidated by thiscourt in its recent pronouncement in Election Commission v. Venkata Rao(2 ) where the observations of theJudicial Committee in Parlakimedi's case, upon which reliance has been placed by the Punjab High Court, havebeen fully explained. It is to be noted ﬁrst of all, that prior to the commencement of the Constitution the powers ofissuing prerogative writs could be exercised in India only by the High Courts of Calcutta,, Madras and Bombay andthat also within very rigid and deﬁned limits. The writs could be issued only to the extent that the power in thatrespect was not taken away 'by the Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure(3) and they could be directed only topersons and authorities within the original civil jurisdiction of these High Courts. The Constitution introduced afundamental change of law in this respect.As has been explained by this Court in the case referred to above, while article 225 of the Constitution preserves tothe existing High Courts the powers and jurisdictions which they had previously, article 226 confers, on all the HighCourts, new and very wide powers (1) 70 I.A. 139.(1) [ 1953] INSC 14; [ 1953] S.C.R. 1144.(3) Vide in this connection Besant v. Tire Advocate General of Madras. 46 I.A. 176.745 in the matter of issuing writs which they never possessed before. ""The makers of the Constitution"" thusobserved Patanjali Sastri C.J.in delivering the judgment of the court, ""having decided to provide for certain basic safeguards for the people inthe new set up, which they called fundamental rights, evidently thought it necessary to provide also a quick andinexpensive remedy for the enforcement of such rights, and, ﬁnding that the prerogative writs, which the courts inEngland had developed and used whenever urgent necessity demanded immediate and decisive interposition,were peculiarly suited for the purpose, they conferred, in the State's sphere, new and wide powers on the HighCourts of issuing directions, orders, or writs primarily for the enforcement of fundamental rights, the power toissue such directions, etc. 'for any other purpose' being also included with a view apparently to place all the HighCourts in this country in somewhat the same position as the Court of King's Bench in England."" There are only twolimitations placed upon the exercise of these powers by a High Court under article 226 of the Constitution; one isthat-the power is to be exercised ""throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction"", that is tosay, the writs issued' by the court cannot run beyond the territories subject to its jurisdiction.The other limitation is that the person or authority to whom the High COurt is empowered to issue writs ""must bewithin those territories"" and this implies that they must be amenable to its jurisdiction either by residence orlocation within those territories. It is with reference to these two conditions thus mentioned that the jurisdiction ofthe High Courts to issue writs under article 226 of the Constitution is to be determined. The observations of theJudicial Committee in Parlakimedi's case(1) have strictly speaking no direct bearing on the point. It is true as thePrivy Council said in that case that the question of jurisdiction must be regarded as one of substance, but themeaning and implication of this observation could be ascertained only with reference to the context of (1) 701. A.129.11--95 S.C. 1./59 746 the facts and circumstances of that case. As was pointed out by this court in the case referredto above(1): ""Their Lordships considered, in the peculiar situation they were dealing with, that the mere location ofthe appellate authority alone in the town of Madras was not a suﬃcient basis for the exercise of jurisdictionwhereas both the subject matter, viz., the settlement of rent for lands in Ganjam, and the Revenue Oﬃcerauthorised to make the settlement at ﬁrst instance were outside the local limits of the jurisdiction of the HighCourt. If the Court in Madras were recognised as having jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari to the appellateauthority in Madras, it would practically be recognising the court's jurisdiction over the Revenue Oﬃcer in Ganjamand the settlement of rents for lands there, which their Lordships held it never had. That was the 'substance' of thematter they were looking at."" In our opinion, therefore, the ﬁrst contention raised by Dr.Tek Chand must be accepted as sound and the view taken by the Punjab High Court on the question of jurisdictioncannot be sustained.So far as the second point is concerned, the High Court relies upon the ordinary rule of construction that where thelegislature has passed a new statute giving a new remedy, that remedy is the only one which .could be pursued. Itis said that the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, itself provides a remedy against anywrong or' illegal order of the Investigating Commission and under section 8 (5) of the Act, the aggrieved party canwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/6.html/95959539545 9/12/ 2020K.S .

Wethink that it is not necessary for us to express any ﬁnal opinion in this case as to whether section 8 (5) of the Act isto be regarded as providing the only remedy available to the aggrieved party and that it excludes altogether theremedy provided for (1) A.I.R. z953 S.C. 310, 214; [ 1953] INSC 14; [ 1953] S.C.R. 1144.747 under article 226 of the Constitution. For purposes of this case it is enough to state- that the remedy providedfor in article 226 of the Constitution is a discretionary remedy and the High Court has always the discretion torefuse to grant any writ if it is satisﬁed that the aggrieved party can have an adequate or suitable relief elsewhere.So far as the present case is concerned, it has been brought to our notice that the appellants before us havealready availed themselves of the remedy provided for in section 8(5) of the Investigation Commission Act andthat a reference has been made to the High Court of Allahabad in terms of that provision which is awaitingdecision. In these circumstances, we think that it would not be proper to allow the appellants to invoke thediscretionary jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution at the present stage, and on this ground alone, wewould refuse to interfere with the orders made by the High Court. Dr. Tek Chand argues that the Income-taxauthorities have not referred all the matters to the High Court which the appellants wanted them to do. But forthis there is a remedy provided in the Act itself and in case a proceeding occasions a gross miscarriage of justice,there is always the jurisdiction in this court to interfere by way of special leave. In the result, we dismiss theappeals but in the circumstances of the case make no order as to costs. ' Appeals dismissed.Agent for the appellant: Rajinder Narain.Agent for the respondents: R.H.

BINOD KANUNGO & ORS [14] INSC 8; AIR 14 SC 22; 14 SCR 93 (4 Fe bru ary 14)The appellant was a minister in the State of Orissa. He was nominated as a candidate for the Orissa LegislativeAssembly and was later declared to have been elected. One of his rivals was the 1st respondent who ﬁled anelection petition challenging the election on a number of grounds, among them, the following.The appellant had ﬁled about two dozen nomination papers.In ﬁve of them the proposer was a Government servant and in four the seconder. The 1st respondent stated thatthis was the ﬁrst step in a scheme to get the assistance of Government oﬃcers in furtherance of the appellant'selection and to ""use and utilse"" them ""for the purposes of the election."" There were also other allegations Whichwe need not consider here.The appellant made counter allegations against the 1st respondent, whom he had defeated, but they do notconcern us either.The Election Tribunal framed twelve issues and examined 101 witnesses, but when it came to make its order itproceeded to decide only two issues instead of deciding the whole case. It held that as the proposers andseconders referred to above were admittedly Government servants that constituted a major corrupt practice andso invalidated the election under section 123 (8) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (No. XLIII of 1951).The other of the two decided issues does not concern this appeal.The appellant thereupon petitioned the High Court for a writ of certiorari Under article 226 of the Constitution.The High Court refused to interfere. The learned Judges held that there was no want of jurisdiction in the tribunaland that the tribunal's view of the law was a possible and reasonable one , accordingly, as the High Court was not acourt of appeal from the tribunal, they were not called upon to decide the question as a court of appeal.The appellant was granted special leave to appeal by this court against the order Of the Election Tribunal.915 A question of 'great public importance aﬀecting Government servants is involved and we deem it right toexamine the question under our special jurisdiction under article 136.The only sections we are called upon to consider are sections 33 (2) and 123 (8). The former provides that- ""Anyperson whose name is registered in the electoral roll of the constituency and who is not subject to anydisqualiﬁcation mentioned in section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (XLIII of 1950) maysubscribe as proposer or seconder as man nomination papers.as there are vacancies to be ﬁlled...According to the latter- ""The obtaining or procuring or abetting...... by a candidate or his agent or, by any otherperson with the 'connivance of a candidate or his agent, any assistance for the furtherance of the prospects of thecandidate's election from any person serving under the Government of India or the Government of any State otherthan the giving of vote by such person"" shall be deemed to be a major corrupt practice for the purposes of the Act.A corrupt practice of this kind entails disqualiﬁcation for membership (section 140).Section 33 (2) is general and confers the privilege of proposing or seconding a candidate for election on everyperson who is registered in the electoral roll provided be is not disqualiﬁed under section 16 of the Act of 1950.That section excludes three classes of persons but not Government servants, unless of course they happen to fallwithin those classes. Therefore, so far as section 33 (2) is concerned, a Government servant is entitled to nominateor second a candidate for election unless he happens to fall in one of the three excluded categories. The question iswhether section 123 (8) takes away from Government servants that which section 33 (2) gives to them. We do notthink it does.Viewing the question as a plain matter of construetion, we ﬁnd that when section 33(2) was framed those 916 whopassed it had in mind the desirability of excluding certain classes of persons from its scope and they chose to limitthose classes to three. Therefore, in the absence of express provision to the contrary elsewhere, or unless it followsby necessary implication, the section must be construed to mean that those not. expressly excluded are intendedto be included. As Government servants are not in the excluded categories it follows that so far as this section isconcerned they are not disqualiﬁed from proposing and seconding a candidate's nomination.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/8.html/02095950951959524 9/12/2RAJ KRUSHNA BOSE V. BINOD KANUNGO & ORS [14] INSC 8; AIR 14 SC 22; 14 SCR 93 (4 Fe bru ary 14)Now, does section 123 (8) contain express provision to the contrary or can such provision be inferred by necessaryimplication? It is usual, when one section of an Act takes away what another confers, to use a non obstante clauseand say that ""notwithstanding anything contained in section so and so, this or that will happen"", otherwise, if bothsections are clear, there is a head-on clash. It is the duty of courts to avoid that and, whenever it is possible to doso, to construe provisions which appear to conﬂict so that they harmonise.What exactly does section 123 (8) forbid? It is the obtaining or procuring etc., of ""any assistance.........other than the giving of vote by such person."" Therefore, it is permissible for a candidate to canvass Governmentservants for their votes and if a Government servant chooses to reveal his hand it would be permissible for thecandidate to disclose the fact and use it in furtherance of his election, for the law imposes no secrecy on theintentions of those who, of their own free will, choose to say how they intend to vote. They cannot be compelledto disclose the fact and any improper attempt to obtain such information would be a corrupt practice, but equally,they are not completed to keep the fact secret if they do not wish to do so; nor is the candidate. If therefore thelaw permits this, we ﬁnd it diﬃcult to see how in the same breath it can be said to have taken away the rightexpressly conferred by section 33(2). The policy of the law is to keep Government servants aloof from politics andalso to protect them from being imposed on, by those with 917 inﬂuence or in positions of authority and power,and to prevent the machinery of Government from being used in furtherance of a candidate's return. But at thesame time it is not the policy of the law to disenfranchise them or to denude them altogether of their rights asordinary citizens of the land. The balance between the two has, in our opinion, been struck in the mannerindicated above.But though it is permissible for a candidate to go that far, he cannot go further and if the procurement ofGovernment servants to propose and second a nomination is part of a plan to procure their assistance for thefurtherance of the candidate's prospects in other ways than by vote, then section 123(8) is attracted, for in thatcase, the plan, and its fulﬁllment, must be viewed as a connected whole and the acts of proposing or secondingwhich are innocent in themselves cannot be separated from the rest.Our conclusion on the preliminary issue may also be supported on another ground. The major corrupt practicereferred to in clause (8) of section 123 consists in obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempt to obtain or procureby a candidate or his agent etc., any assistance for the furtherance of the prospects of the candidate's electionfrom any person serving under the Government of India or the Government of any State other than the giving ofvote by such person. In order, therefore, to bring a case within the mischief of that clause the assistance must befor the furtherance of the prospects of the candidate's election.Section 79(b) deﬁnes a candidate as meaning "" a person who has been or claims to have been nominated as acandidate at any election, and any such person shall be deemed to have been a candidate as from the time when,with the election in prospect, he began to hold himself out as a prospective candidate."" Unless, therefore, a casefalls within the latter half of the deﬁnition a person becomes a candidate under the ﬁrst part of the deﬁnition onlywhen he has been duly nominated as a candidate and the furtherance of 918 the prospects of a candidate'selection must, therefore, in such a case commence from after that stage. Although evidence was adduced on bothsides, there has been no ﬁnding so far on questions of fact which may or may not bring the case within the secondpart of the deﬁnition. In the absence of such a ﬁnding the case must be regarded, for the purpose of thepreliminary issue, as governed by the ﬁrst part of the deﬁnition and as such the proposing and seconding by aGovernment servant cannot be regarded as ""assistance for the furtherance of the prospects of the candidate'selection."" In this view of the matter also, the judgment of the Election Tribunal cannot be sustained.We set aside the order of the tribunal and remit the case to the Election Commission with directions to it toreconstitute the tribunal which tried this case and to direct the tribunal to give its ﬁndings on all the issues raisedand to make a fresh order.Our power to make such an order was not questioned but it was said that when the legislature states that theorders of a tribunal under an Act like the one here shall be conclusive and ﬁnal (section 105), then we should notinterfere. It is suﬃcient to say that the powers conferred on us by article 136 of the Constitution and on the HighCourts under article 226 cannot be taken away or whittled down by the legislature. So long as these powersremain, our discretion and that of the High Courts is unfettered.We wish to record our disapproval of the way in which this tribunal shirked its work and tried to take a short cut. Itis essential that these tribunals should do their work in full. They are ad hoc bodies to which remands cannot easilywww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/8.html/02095950951959534 9/12/2RAJ KRUSHNA BOSE V.

Their duty under section 99 is, "" where any charge is made in the petition ofany corrupt or illegal practice having been committed at the election"" to record "" a ﬁnding whether any corrupt orillegal practice has or has not been proved to have been committed...and the,nature of that corrupt or illegalpractice."" 919 Also, "" to give the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been guiltyof any corrupt or illegal practice and the nature of that practice."" Their duty does not end by declaring an electionto be void or not because section 99 provides that in addition to that "" at the time of making an order undersection 98the tribunal shall also make an order etc........"" A number of allegations were made in the petition aboutcorruption and illegal practices, undue inﬂuence and bribery. It was the duty of the tribunal not only to enquire intothose allegations, as it did, but also to complete the enquiry by recording ﬁndings about those allegations andeither condemn or clear the candidate of the charges made.We make no order about costs.Bose J.-I agree on all but one point. I have some doubt about the reason given by my learned brother which isbased on the deﬁnition' of ""candidate"" in the Act.

February 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.I2--95 S.C. I./59 762 MUKHERJEA J.--These consolidated appeals, numbering fourteen in all, are directed against acommon judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated the 23rd of August, 1952, by which thelearned Judges dismissed the petitions of the diﬀerent appellants made under article 226 of the Constitution. Theappellants are landholders of Madras, holding zamindaries within that State, and in their applications under article226 of the Constitution they prayed for writs in the nature of mandamus, directing the State of Madras to forbearfrom notifying and taking over possession of the estates held by them and also to cancel the notiﬁcations alreadyissued, in exercise of its powers under the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, (Act XXVIof 1948). This Act, the constitutional validity of which has been assailed by the appellants, was passed by theProvincial Legislature of Madras functioning under the Government of India Act, 1935, and it received the assentthe Governor-General of India on the 2nd of April, 1949. The avowed object of the Act is to abolish the zamindarysystem by repealing the Madras Permanent Settlement Regulation of 1802, to acquire the rights landholders in thepermanently settled and other ,estates and to introduce the Ryotwari system in all such estates. After the adventof the Constitution, the Act was reserved for certiﬁcation of the President and it was certiﬁed on the 12th of April,1950. In the petitions presented by the appellants, a large number of grounds were put forward by way ofattacking the validity of the legislation which was characterised as conﬁscatory in its character and subversive ofthe fundamental right of property, which the petitioners had in the zamindaries held by them under thePermanent Settlement Regulation. Pending the disposal of these petitions, the Constitution (First Amendment)Act of 1951 was passed on 1st of June, 1951, and this amendment introduced two new articles namely, article 31-Aand 31-B in the Constitution, apparently with a view to protect the 'various laws enacted for acquisition of estatesfrom being challenged under the relevant articles of Part III of the 763 Constitution. Article 31-B speciﬁcally refersto a number of statutes mentioned in the ninth Schedule to the Constitution and it declares expressly that none ofthem shall be deemed to be void on the ground that they contravened any of the fundamental rights,notwithstanding the decision of a court or tribunal to the contrary. It is not disputed that Madras Act XXVI of 1948is one of the statutes included in this schedule. It may be remembered that an attempt was made to impeach thevalidity of the Constitution (First Amendment) Act itself before this court in the case of Shankari Prasad Singh Deov. Union of India (1). The attempt failed and after the pronouncement of this court in Shankari Prasad's case, thegrounds upon which the writ petitions of the appellants were sought to be supported became for the most partunavailing. It appears that at the time of the ﬁnal hearing of the applications the arguments actually advanced onbehalf of the petitioners were aimed not at invalidating the enactment as a whole, but only some of its provisions,ﬁrstly on the ground that there was no public purpose behind the acquisition of some of the items of propertymentioned therein and secondly, that the provisions for compensation in certain aspects were colourable exerciseof legislative powers and constituted a fraud upon the Constitution Act of 1935. These arguments were sought tobe supported entirely on the authority of the majority decision of this court in the case of The State of Bihar v.Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh (2) to the extent that it pronounced two of the provisions of the Bihar LandReforms Act. 1950--a legislation similar in type to the Madras Act 1948--to be unconstitutional. These contentionsdid not ﬁnd favour with the learned Judges of the High Court who heard the petitions and holding that theprinciples enunciated by the majority of this court in the Bihar case referred to above were not applicable to theimpugned provisions of the Madras Act, they dismissed all the petitions. Certiﬁcates, however, were granted bythe High Court to the petitioners (1) [ 1951] INSC 45; [ 1952] S.C.R. 89.(2) [ 1952] S.C.R. 889.764 under article 132(1) of the Constitution and it is on the strength of these certiﬁcates that the appeals have'come before us.Mr. Ayyangar, appearing in support of these appeals, has taken his stand solely upon the doctrine of ' 'colourablelegislation' as enunciated by the majority of this court in the Bihar case referred to above. He has very properly notattempted to make any point as to the absence of a public purpose in regard to any of the items of acquisition,since it is clear that according to the majority view of this court, as explained in Narayan Deo v. State of Orissa (1),the existence of a public purpose is not a justiciable issue in case of an enactment which having fulﬁlled therequirements of clause (4) of article 31 of the Constitution enjoys the protection aﬀorded by it.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/9.html/95955956959524 9/12/ 2020ZAMINDAR OF ETTAYAPURAM V. THE ST ATE OF MADRAS [14] INSC 9; AIR 14 SC 27; 14 SCR 71 (5 February 14)The contentions of Mr. Ayyangar, in substance, are that the provisions of 'section 27(i) as well as of section 30 ofthe impugned Act are colourable legislative provisions which have been enacted in fraud of the Constitution Act of1935. It appears that in determining the amount of compensation, that is to be paid under the Act, in respect of anacquired estate, it is necessary, ﬁrst of all, to ascertain what has been described as the 'basic annual sum' in regardto that estate. The' basic annual sum comprises several items or parts which have been set out in section 27 andthe subsequent sections of the Act, and it is upon the amount of the basis annual sum determined in accordancewith the provisions of these sections that the total amount of compensation money payable to a proprietor ismade to depend. Mr. Ayyangar contends that section 27(i) of the Act, which lays down that in computing the basicannual sum only one-third of the gross annual Ryotwari demand of speciﬁed kinds is to be taken into account, is acolourable provision which, ignores altogether the actual income derived from the property and introduces anartiﬁcial and an arbitrary standard for determining the income or proﬁts which has absolutely no relation to facts.Similarly, in computing the net miscellaneous revenue, which is an (x) [ 1945] S.C.R. .A.I.R. x953 8. G. 375 at P. 380.765 element in the computation of the basic annual sum, what is to be taken into account under section 30 is notthe average of net annual income which the proprietors themselves derived from the sources, mentioned in theAct, when they were in possession of the estates, but which the Government might derive from them in futureyears after the date of notiﬁcation. 'Thus if on account of mismanagement or for other reasons the Governmentdoes not derive any income from these sources, the proprietor would not have any compensation under this headat all. It is argued that these are mere devices or contrivances aimed at , conﬁscation of private property and theyneither lay down nor are based upon any principle of compensation.Whatever the merits of these contentions might be, it appears to us that there is an initial and an insuperablediﬃculty in the way of the learned counsel's invoking the authority of the majority decision of this court in the caseof The State of Bihar v.Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh(1) to the circumstances of 'the present case. The Bihar Land Reforms Act,'which was the subject matter of decision in that case, was a legislation which was pending at the time when theConstitution came into force. It was reserved for consideration of the President and received his assent in duecourse and consequently under clause (4)of article 31 of the Constitution it was immune from judicial scrutiny onthe ground that the compensation provided by it was inadequate or unjust. With regard 'to two of the provisions ofthe Act, however, which were embodied in sections 4 (b) and 23(f) of 'the Act, it was held by the majority of thiscourt that they were void as they really did not come within entry 42 of List III of Schedule VII of the Constitution,under which they purported to have been enacted. Entry 42 of List III speaks of ""principles on which compensationfor property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the Union or of a State or for any other public purpose isto be determined, and the form and the manner in which such compensation is (1) [ 1952] s.c.R. 889.766 to be given."" It was pointed out that entry 42 was undoubtedly the description of a legislative head and indeciding the competency of a legislation under this entry, the court was not concerned with the justice orpropriety of the principles upon which the determination of the compensation was to be made or the form ormanner in which it was to be given. But even then, the legislation must rest upon some principle of givingcompensation and not of denying or withholding it, and a legislation could not be supported which was basedupon something which was non-existent or was unrelated to facts and consequently could not have a conceivablebearing on any principle of compensation. The initial diﬃculty in the way of invoking this doctrine in the presentcase lies in the fact that the legislation, which is impugned here, was passed by the Madras Provincial Legislaturefunctioning under the Government of India Act, 1935, and' there was no entry in any of the lists attached to the Actof 1935 corresponding to entry 42 in List I1I of the Indian Constitution. The only entry relevant to. this point in theAct of 1935 was entry9 of List I1 which spoke merely of 'compulsory acquisition of land'; and it is clear that a dutyto pay compensation or of ' laying down any principle regarding it was not inherent in the language of that entry.The guarantee for payment of compensation, so far as the Constitution Act of 1935 is concerned, was contained insection 299 clause (2) which was worded as follows:""Neither the Federal Legislature nor a Provincial Legislature shall have power to make any law' authorising thecompulsory acquisition for public purposes of any land, or any commercial or industrial' undertaking ........unless the law provides for the payment of compensation for the property acquired and either ﬁxes the amount ofthe compensation, or speciﬁes the principles on which, and the manner in which it is to be determined."" Theappellants could have very well relied upon this guarantee if a bar had not been created in their way by theprovision of article 31(6) of the Constitution. That clause of article 31 stands of follows:www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/9.html/95955956959534 9/12/ 2020ZAMINDAR OF ETTAYAPURAM V.

It is not disputed that the Madras Act XXVI of1948 does fulﬁl all the requirements mentioned above.Consequently, it is not possible for us to allow the appellants to raise the contentions which the learned counsel ontheir behalf wants to raise.

V . THE STATE OF ANDHRA [14] INSC 11; AIR 14 SC 21; 1…The appellant company was formed and registered under the Indian Companies Act in 1924 with the object, interalia, of generating and supplying electrical ,energy to the public in Rajahmundry. In 1949 the Madras Legislaturepassed the Madras Electricity Supply Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, 1949. The Act received the assent of theGovernor-General on the 18th January, 1950, and was published in the Oﬃcial Gazette on the 24th January, 1950.Upon the Constitution of India coming into force on the 26th January, 1950, the Act was submitted to thePresident for his certiﬁcation and on the 12th April, 1950, the President certiﬁed that the Act should not be calledin question m any court on the ground that it contravened the provisions of clause (2) of article 31 or it-contravened the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935. By an order inwriting made on the 2nd September, 1950, the Government of Madras acting under section 4(1) of the Actdeclared that the undertaking of the appellant company should vest in the Government on the date speciﬁedtherein. Under the proviso to section 4(1) the Government from time to time postponed the date of vesting andthe 2nd April, 1951, was the last-extended date ﬁxed for such vesting. On the 29th March, 1951, the appellantcompany ﬁled C.M.P. No. 4697 of 1951, under article 226 for quashing the order of the Government.Shortly stated the contentions of the. appellant before the High Court were that the Act was ultra vires in that (1) itwas beyond the legislative competency of the Madras Legislature to enact it, (2) it was not enacted to subserveany public purpose, and (3) the compensation provided for was illusory. The High Court repelled each and all of theaforesaid contentions of the appellant company.It held that the legislation was with respect to electricity under entry 31 of the 781 concurrent list in the seventhSchedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, and was not a legislation with respect to corporations under entry33 in list I as contended by the appellant and that, therefore, the Madras Legislature was competent to enact it. Itfurther held that the Act having received the certiﬁcate of the President the challenge based on an allegedabsence of public purpose or the illusory nature of the compensation was shut out and could not be raised. TheHigh Court, however, held that certain sections and rule 19(2) of the Rules framed under the Act were invalid andsubject thereto dismissed the application of the appellant company. The High Court granted leave to the appellantcompany to appeal before this court. The appeal has now come up for heating before us.Learned counsel appearing in support of the appeal has not pressed before us the contention raised in the HighCourt as to the absence of public purpose or the illusory nature of the compensation provided by the Act. He hasconﬁned his submissions to the question of the legislative competency of the Madras Legislature to enact thispiece of legislation. In the High Court the contest centered round the question whether the Act was a law withrespect to electricity under entry 31 of the concurrent list or with respect to corporations under entry 33 in list I.The High Court held that the Act was, in pith and substance, a law with respect to electricity and was, therefore,within the legislative competency of the Provincial Legislature. In his arguments before us learned counselcontended that the act is in substance and eﬀect one for the acquisition of an electrical undertaking and, as such,is ultra vires because- (a) the acquisition of an electrical undertaking was not a legislative item in any of the threelists in the seventh schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, and (b) in so far as it relates to the acquisition ofan electrical undertaking of a corporation it is a law with respect to corporations under entry 33 in list I.782 In our opinion this appeal can be disposed of on the ﬁrst of the two grounds mentioned above.Turning to the Act it will be noticed that the long title of the Act is ""an Act to make provision for the acquisition ofundertakings in the Province of Madras supplying electricity."" The preamble recites the expediency of makingProvision ""for the acquisition of undertakings in the Province of Madras engaged in supplying electricity."" Section 1gives the short title, extent and commencement of the Act. Section 2 is a deﬁnition section. Section 3 providesthat the Act shall apply to all undertakings of licensees including certain undertakings therein mentioned. Section4 empowers the Government to take over any undertaking by making an order in writing declaring that suchundertaking shall vest in the Government on a speciﬁed date.Section 5 provides for compensation payable to a licensee who is not a local authority. The section gives an optionto the licensee to claim compensation on one of three bases therein speciﬁed. Section 6 deals with compensationpayable where the licensee is a local authority. Section 7 speciﬁes the properties or assets which will vest accordingaS compensation is claimed under one basis or another. Section 8 provides for the appointment of a solerepresentative to act as the sole and accredited representative of the licensee in connection with the handing overof the undertaking and performing on behalf of the licensee the functions thereinafter speciﬁed. The choice ofbasis of compensation is to be made within one month under section 9 and such choice once intimated to theGovernment is not to be open to revision except with the concurrence of the Government. Section 10 authorisesthe Government, in case the licensee has disposed of any of the assets otherwise than in the normal course ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/11.html/020959559524 9/12/2THE RAJAHMUNDR Y ELECTRIC SUPPL YCORPORATION L TD.

THE STATE OF ANDHRA [14] INSC 11; AIR 14 SC 21; 1…events causing loss to the Government as succeeding owners, to deduct from the compensation payable to thelicensee an amount which they consider to be the loss sustained by them. Section 11 prescribes the variousdeductions which the Government shall be entitled to make from the compensation payable under the Act. The-manner of 783 payment or deposit of compensation is laid down in section12. Section 13 permits the Government to repay all loans, debentures, mortgages and the like outstanding on thevesting date at any time before the time ﬁxed for repayment. Section 14 is the arbitration section. Section 15provides for the termination of the managing agency. Section 16 authorises the Government to terminate theservices of any person on the staﬀ of the licensee immediately before the vesting 'date. Section 17 requires alllicensees to prepare and hand over to the Government a complete inventory of all the assets. Section 18 givespower of entry to the Government or any oﬃcer authorised by the Government upon any land or premises in thepossession of the licensee. Section 19 prescribes penalties for various defaults therein speciﬁed. Section 20 makescertain oﬃcers of a company liable for the oﬀence committed by the company. Section 21 gives protection againstsuit or prosecution for anything done in good faith under any rule or order made under the Act.Section 22 confers rule-making power on the Government. Section 23 provides that the provisions of certain Actsin so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act shall have no eﬀect. Section 24 gives power to theGovernment to do anything which appears to them necessary for the purpose of removing any diﬃculty. From theabove summary it will be noticed that the Act does not purport to make any provision for the granting of licensesor maintenance of works for generating or transmitting energy or for supplying electrical energy as one wouldexpect to ﬁnd in a law dealing with electricity nor does the Act purport to make any provision for theincorporation, regulation or winding up of trading corporations. On the contrary, it is abundantly clear from thelong title, the preamble and the sections that it is, in pith and substance, nothing but an Act to provide for theacquisition of electrical undertakings.Section 299 (2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, provided that neither the Federal nor a Provincial Legislaturewould have power to make any law authorising the compulsory acquisition for public purposes 784 of any land orany commercial or industrial undertaking or any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrialundertaking unless the law provided for the payment of compensation for the property acquired.Compulsory acquisition of property is undoubtedly an important sovereign right of the State but this right has tobe exercised under a law. The legislative power of the State was distributed by sections 99 and 100 amongst theFederal Legislature and the Provincial Legislatures in the manner provided' in the several lists set forth in theSeventh Schedule to the Act. Section 100 read with entry 9 in list II authorised the Provincial Legislature to make alaw with respect to compulsory acquisition of land. There was no entry in any of the three lists relating tocompulsory acquisition of any commercial or industrial undertaking, although section 299 (2) clearly contemplateda law authorising compulsory acquisition for public purposes of a commercial or industrial undertaking. Theacquisition of a commercial or industrial undertaking not being the subject-matter of any entry in any of the threelegislative lists, neither the Federal Legislature nor the Provincial Legislature could enact a law with respect tocompulsory acquisition of a commercial or industrial undertaking. Under section 104, however, the Governor-General, in his individual discretion, could, by public notiﬁcation, empower either the Federal Legislature or aProvincial Legislature to enact a law with respect to any matter not enumerated in any of the lists in the seventhschedule to the Act. It is, therefore, clear that although Parliament expressly entrusted the Provincial Legislaturewith power to make a law with respect to compulsory acquisition of land it did not straightaway grant any power,either to the Federal Legislature or the Provincial Legislature, to make a law with respect to compulsoryacquisition of a commercial or industrial undertaking but left it to the discretion of the Governor-General toempower either of the Legislatures to enact such a law. There is no suggestion that the Governor-General had, inexercise of his discretionary powers under section 104, authorised the Madras 785 Legislature to enact theimpugned Act and, therefore, the Act was, prima facie, beyond the legislative competency of the MadrasLegislature.The learned Advocate-General of Madras urges that there was implicit in every entry in the legislative lists in theSeventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, an inherent power to make a law with respect to a matterancillary or incidental to the subject-matter of each entry. His argument is that each entry in the list carried with itan inherent power to provide for the compulsory acquisition of any property, land or any commercial or industrialundertaking, while making a law under such entry. It is quite true that the powers of each Legislature to make lawswith respect to the diﬀerent subjects assigned to it by the, appropriate list were to be regarded as wide andplenary and also covering matters incidental or ancillary to such subject-matter, but it is, nevertheless, clear fromthe provision of the Act that the power to make a law for compulsory acquisition was, under entry 9 in list II, givenwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/11.html/020959559534 9/12/2THE RAJAHMUNDR Y ELECTRIC SUPPL YCORPORATION L TD. V . THE STATE OF ANDHRA [14] INSC 11; AIR 14 SC 21; 1…only to Provincial Legislatures and that such power of the Provincial Legislatures was, under that entry, limited tomaking a law for the compulsory acquisition of land only and that unless the Governor-General made an .orderunder section 104 of the Act the Provincial Legislatures had no power to make a law for the compulsory acquisitionof any property other than land ,and that the Federal Legislature had no power to make any law with respect tothe compulsory acquisition of any property at all. If the argument of the learned Advocate-General were correctthen entry 9 in list II 'was wholly unnecessary for under entry 21 in list II the Provincial Legislatures could make alaw for the compulsory acquisition of land.A similar argument was repelled by this court in the State of Bihar v. Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh( ).The matter is placed beyond any doubt or dispute by the provisions of section 127 of the Government of India Act,1935, which provided that the Federal might, if it ,deemed it necessary to acquire any land situate in a (1) [ 1952]S.C.R. 889.786 Province for any purpose connected with a matter with respect to which the Federal Legislature had power tomake laws, require the Province to acquire the land on behalf and at the expense of the Federation. If power'inhered in the Federal Legislature to make a law for the acquisition of any property for any purpose connectedwith a matter with respect to which it had' power to make laws then section 127 would not have' been necessary atall. The absence of any entry empowering any Legislature to make laws with respect to compulsory acquisition ofa commercial or industrial undertaking and the provisions of section 127 to, which reference has just been mademake it abundantly clear that the contentions urged by the learned' Advocate- General cannot possibly besustained. In our opinion, therefore, it must be held that the Madras Legislature had no legislative competency toenact the impugned law.This is suﬃcient to dispose of this appeal and it is not necessary to express any opinion, on the other points raisedin the court below.The result, therefore, is that this appeal must be' allowed with costs both in the High Court as well as in this court.Appeal allowed.Agent for the appellant: M.S.K.

Section 3 of the same Act is also assailed on behalf of some ofthe appellants but for the purpose of deciding these appeals it will not be necessary to deal with the latterquestion.Criminal Appeals Nos. 65 and 66 of 1952, which are directed against the judgment and order of the High Court ofJudicature at, Bombay in two petitions under article 226 of the Constitution praying for the issue of 935 a writ ofmandamus requiring the respondent not to remove them from India on the ground that the impugned section 7 isvoid may be treated as the leading case which will govern the other appeals.The facts of each of these appeals are slightly diﬀerent but they proceed upon the common assertion that theappellants are citizens of the Indian Republic. This fact was assumed in the leading case but it is not, disputed thatthe status of the appellants as Indian citizens in all the cases has not been investigated and determined by any ofthe courts below against whose decision the appeals have been brought. Having heard the learned counselappearing in support of the appeals and the learned Solicitor-General we have reached the conclusion that section7 is void in so far as it infringes the right of a citizen of India under article 19(1) (e) of the Constitution.The Act in question received the assent of the Governor- General on April 22, 1949, and was published in theGazette of India Extraordinary on April 23. It is a short Act containing nine sections. It is intituled an Act to "" controlthe admission into, and regulate the movements in, India of persons from Pakistan "". The preamble opens with thewords ""Whereas it is expedient to control the admission into, and regulate the movements in, India of personsfrom Pakistan. "" Section 2 (b) deﬁnes "" oﬃcer of Government "" as any oﬃcer of the Central Government and 2 (c)deﬁnes ""permit"" as a ""Permit issued or renewed or the period whereof has been extended in accordance with therules made under this Act.

""Section 8 provides for protection to persons acting in good faith and section 9 repeals the Inﬂux from, Pakistan(Control) Ordinance, XXXXIV of 1948.The use of the word 'person' in section 7, read with the title and preamble of the Act leaves no doubt that. the Actapplies to citizens and non-citizens alike. So 937 far as a non-citizen is concerned, it is not contended before us3that the executive Government has no authority to direct his removal from India and the only contention raisedbefore us is whether the Central Government has any power to direct the removal of an Indian citizen on either ofthe grounds mentioned in section 7. Section 7, it is contended, confers upon the Central Government unfetteredpower to direct the removal from India not only of a person who has committed an oﬀence punishable undersection 5 of the Act but also one against whom a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed such anoﬀence. That an Indian citizen visiting Pakistan for any purpose whatsoever and returning to India may be requiredto produce D, permit or passport as the case may be before he can be allowed to enter the country, may well be.regarded as a proper restriction upon entry but to say that if he enters the country without a permit or on aninvalid permit, or commits a breach of any of the conditions of the permit he may, on conviction for such oﬀence,be ordered to be removed from the country is tantamount to taking away his fundamental right guaranteed underarticle 19(1) (e), "" to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. "" The order is sought to be supported bythe learned- Solicitor-General on the ground that it falls within exception (5) of article 19. The proposition that theorder imposes in the interest of the general public a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the. right conferredupon an Indian citizen to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India is hardly statable. It is possible toconceive of an Indian citizen being guilty of serious prejudicial Acts such as espionage and disloyalty to his countryin which case he may render himself liable to the gravest penalty which the Government may think ﬁt by law toimpose upon him but it would be repugnant to all notions of democracy and opposed to the fundamental rightsguaranteed in Part III of the Constitution to order his expulsion from the country, for to hold otherwise would betantamount to destroying the right of citizenship conferred by Part II of the, Constitution.This 938 result is permissible only by recourse to article 11 of the Constitution. Again it will be noticed that section7 imposes the penalty of removal not only upon a conviction under section 5 but goes further and brings about thesame result even where there is a reasonable suspicion entertained by the Central Government that such anoﬀence has been committed. The question whether an oﬀence has been committed is left entirely to thesubjective determination of the Government. The inference of a reasonable suspicion rests upon the arbitrary andunrestrained discretion of the Government, and before a citizen is condemned, all that the Government has to dois to issue an order that a reasonable suspicion exists in their mind that an oﬀence under section 5 has beencommitted. The section does not provide for the issue of a notice to the person concerned to show cause againstthe order nor is he aﬀorded any opportunity to clear his conduct of the suspicion entertained against him. This isnothing short of a travesty of the right of citizenship.The learned Solicitor-General argued that the provision must be viewed in the back-ground of the events whichtook place at the time of the partition and the unsatisfactory relations existing between India and Pakistan. up tothe present day. Even so the penalty imposed upon a citizen by his own Government merely upon a breach of thepermit Regulations, however serious it may be and, more, upon a reasonable suspicion only by the executiveauthority of his having violated the conditions of the permit is utterly disproportionate th the gravity of theoﬀence and is in our opinion indefensible. A law which subjects a citizen to the extreme penalty of a virtualforfeiture of his citizenship upon conviction for a mere breach of the permit Regulations or upon a reasonablesuspicion of having committed such a breach can hardly be justiﬁed upon the ground that it imposes a reasonablerestriction upon the fundamental right to reside and settle in the country in the interest of the public.

TE SAE OF BOMBAY & OS [] IC 13; AIR 14 SC 29; 14 SR 93 (15 Fy 14)purports to control admission into and regulate the movements in India of persons entering from Pakistan butsection 7 oversteps the limits of control 939 and regulation when it provides for removal of a citizen from his owncountry. To use the language of this court in Chintaman Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh and Ram Krishna v.The State of Madhya Pradesh(1), "" The eﬀect of the provisions of the Act, however, has no reasonable relation tothe subject in view but is so drastic in scope that it goes much in excess of that object.It may be said that the sentry on guard at any of the check- posts on the frontier between the two countries canprevent not only unauthorised entry of a citizen by force but can also throw him out if the person has managed toenter surreptitiously. Exactly what the sentrys' duties are was not argued before us. They would naturally varyaccording to the circumstances and the orders which be receives but ordinarily we apprehend that the duty of asentry at the border would be to prevent as far as lay in his power un- authorised entry into India. If any personclaims to have the right to enter, the sentry's duty would be to hand him over to the Commander of the Guard andnormally it would be the duty of that Commander to hand him over to the proper authority empowered todetermine the right which he claims.In the case of an unauthorised entry, ordinarily the duty of the sentry is to arrest a man and hand him over to theproper authority for punishment and in extreme cases he may have the right to shoot the person who does nothalt on his command and explain his presence at the outpost. In normal circumstances we doubt if the sentrywould have the right to forcibly expel a man who crosses the border.The learned Chief Justice (Chagla C. J.) took the view that section 7 is consequential to section 3 and held that ifsection 3 controlling admission by means of a permit is valid, section 7 must be held to be equally valid. Thisargument is fallacious. In the ﬁrst place, section 7 is by no means wholly consequential to section 3. The ﬁrst partno doubt renders the person concerned liable to removal upon conviction under section 5 but further empowers.the Central Government (1) [ 1950] INSC 29; [ 1950] S.C.R. 759.940 to pass the same order independently of these provisions even where there is no conviction and a reasonablesuspicion exists that an oﬀence has been committed. Assuming, however, that section 7 is consequential tosection 3 it gives no opportunity to the aggrieved person to show cause against his removal. There is no forumprovided to which the aggrieved party could have recourse in order to vindi- cate his character or meet thegrounds upon which it is based. Neither the Act nor the rules framed thereunder.indicate what procedure is to be followed by Government in arriving at the conclusion that a breach of section 3 orof the rules under section 4 has taken place, In Shabbir Hussain v. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Another(1) theAllahabad High Court held that a law allowing the removal from a territory of India of any citizen is incontravention of article 19 (1) (d) and(e) of the Constitution and is void in view of article 13(1). The order which waschallenged before them was one passed under section 7 and was set aside.In Criminal Writ No. 147 of 1951 decided on December 11, 1951, a Bench of the Punjab High Court (Weston C. J. andHarnam Singh J.) while setting aside the order under section 7 against a citizen of India who had entered Indiawithout a permit and was ﬁrst convicted and then ordered to be externed observed:""The powers of removal or banishment given by section 7 of the Inﬂux from Pakistan (Control) Act, 1949, connotbe invoked against citizens of India. No doubt, she committed an oﬀence under section 3 of that Act which appliedto all persons, but that cannot justify her removal even though her entry may have been contrary to the provisionsof the Act."" We are not prepared to accede to the contention urged by the Solicitor-General that a citizen of Indiawho returns to the country without a permit or without a valid permit commits such a grave oﬀence as to justifyhis expulsion from the country. The object of the Act is, not to deport Indian nationals (1) A.I.R. 1952 All. 257.941 committing a breach of the permit or passport Regulations but merely to control admission into and regulatemovements in India of persons from Pakistan and therefore there is no substance in the argument that section 7was intended to achieve the objective of expelling Indian citizens, by and large, if they brought themselves withinthe mischief of section 3.It was faintly contended that the order of physical, removal from India, in addition to the punishment imposedunder section 5 of the Act, amounted to what may be called "" double jeopardy "" and is in conﬂict with article 20 (2)of the Constitution. The short answer to this contention is that there is no second prosecution for the sameoﬀence and therefore no question of double jeopardy arises. See Maqbool Hussain v. The State of Bombay etc.(1)..la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/13.h/020IIVHTTR1954NS95295C3ebruar95wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml410 9/12/2EBRAHM VAZR MAAT V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY & OS [] IC 13; AIR 14 SC 29; 14 SR 93 (15 Fy 14)As a result of the foregoing discussion we declare section 7 to be void under article 13(1) in so far as it conﬂicts withthe fundamental right of a citizen of India under article 19(1) (e) of the Constitution and set it aside. The order will,however, operate only upon proof of the fact that the appellants are citizens of India. The case will, therefore, goback to the High Court for a ﬁnding upon this question. It will be open to the High Court to determine this questionitself or refer it to the court of District Judge for a ﬁnding. Parties will be given full opportunity to ﬁle aﬃdavits orgive other evidence which they may wish to produce.Criminal Appeal No. 5 of 1953.GHULAM HASAN J.-The appellant in this case is a resident of Godhra, District Panchmahals, in the State ofBombay. He went to Pakistan in Marc 1948, and returned to India on May 30, 1949, after obtaining a permit forpermanent return to India from the-High Commissioner for India. In January, 1950, he was prosecuted undersection 5 of Act XXIII of 1949 for having obtained a permit which was not in accordance with the provisions of theAct. The prosecution was withdrawn after 21 years. Subsequently on December 5, 1952, he was served with anotice (1) [ 1953] INSC 36; [ 1953] S.C.R. 730.122 942 ordering him to leave India for Pakistan within 10 days else he would be bodily removed to the Indo-Pakistan border.Thereupon the appellant ﬁled a petition under article 226 contending that section 7 was contrary to hisfundamental rights under articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution and that the same provided no opportunity to theappellant to put his case before the Government oﬃcers, nor was any such opportunity aﬀorded to him. Heasserted that he was a citizen of India.The application was summarily dismissed on December 15, 1952, whereuponleave to appeal to this court was granted under article 132(1) of the constitutional. As this appeal also raises thequestion of the constitutional validity of section 7, it will be governed by the decision which we have arrived at inappeals Nos. 65 and 66 of 1952.Criminal Appeal No. 19 of 1953.GHULAM HASAN J.-The appellant, Haji Faqir Ahmad, is a resident of Rewa in Vindhya Pradesh and alleges that heis a citizen of India. He was prosecuted under section 5 of Act XXIII of 1949 on the ground that he entered Indiafrom Pakistan without a permit and convicted and sentenced.Thereafter he was by an order passed under section 7 bodily removed out of India. His father applied under article226 of the Constitution and section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for setting aside the order. The learnedJudicial Commissioner dismissed the application summarily holding that section 7 was not ultra Vires theConstitution.Mr. Asthana, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, raised a further question that the order was void underarticle 14 inasmuch as it discriminated against members of a particular community coming from Pakistan. There isno warrant for this contention. The Act applies to citizens as well as non-citizens. It applies to all communitiesirrespective of caste or creed. It is contended that the Act must be held to be discriminatory not only by virtue ofits provisions but because of the discriminatory manner in which those provisions have been applied. Thisargument is 943 to be mentioned only to be rejected, for there is no material whatsoever placed before us tojustify the statement. The case in Yick W o v. Peter Hopkins (1) is wholly inapplicable to the facts of the presentcase. We accordingly reject the contention.

Itis further prayed that the State of Bhopal and the Superintendent of Central Jail,, Bhopal, where he was beingdetained be restrained from putting into eﬀect the said order. The petition was made on March 11, 1953. It isstated that the petitioner is a citizen of India having been born in Bhopal in 1922. He was employed in Bhopal for 5years immediately preceding (1) 118 U.S. 356; 30 Law. Ed. 220.944 the commencement of the Constitution of India. He also edited a weekly paper ""Tarjuman"" from Bhopal. Hisname appears as. a voter in the voters"" list of the Bhopal Legislative Assembly (1951-52), as-well as in the electoralroll of the Municipal Board, Bhopal. The was arrested on November 24, 1952 by the Sub-Inspector of Police atlbrahimpura, Bhopal, under section 7 of the Inﬂux from Pakistan (Control) Act XXIII of Pakistan. At the time of thearrest the petitioner was being tried under section 448, Indian Penal Code, in the court of 1st Class Magistrate,Bhopal, and was on bail. The petitioner alleges that he never went to Pakistan, nor entered India without a permitand was never tried and convicted under the Inﬂux from Pakistan (Control) Act of 1949. He challenges the orderunder section 7 as being void under article 19(d) and (e) and articles 21 and 22.The fact that the petitioner is a resident of Bhopal and was employed in the State is not denied on behalf of theState.The aﬃdavit on behalf of the State mentions that the petitioner had gone to Pakistan in may, 1952, and returnedin August, 1952, without a permit. He was arrested on November 24, 1952, without any prior notice but was told atthe time of the arrest that he was to be removed out of India. The petitioner ﬁled an application through his unclebefore the Judicial Commissioner, Bhopal, under article 226 on November 25, 1952, challenging. the order.The Judicial Commissioner granted an interim stay order on the same day. The petition was dismissed on February23, 1953, and the interim order was vacated on March 10, 1953.It is admitted that an oral request was made to the Judicial Commissioner for leave to appeal to this court and itwas prayed that pending the grant of leave the order of stay should continue. Leave was refused on the same dayand the stay order was vacated.There is an aﬃdavit by the Chief Secretary of the State admitting that the petitioner on, the same day banded anapplication to the Superintendent of Jail 945 addressed to this court. The Superintendent of Jail sent it to the ChiefSecretary on March 13, 1953. It was put up before him on the 14th when he forwarded it to the Law Department foropinion on March 16. The petition was returned to him on the 19th with the remark that it should be forwarded tothe Supreme Court. It was sent to this' court on ;March 22. On the same day a telephonic communication was sent,by the Registrar of this court through the States Ministry directing that the petitioner should be detained if he wasstill in India, but it appears that the petitioner had been handed over to the Rajas than Police at Kotah on March 12,1953, and a reply was received by the Inspector-General of Police, Jaipur, that the petitioner had crossed theborder on March 18, 1953. The Superintendent of Jail has also ﬁled an aﬃdavit supporting the Chief Secretarpandhas admitted that it was wrong on his part not to have sent the, petition submitted by the prisoner immediately tothis court and that he in good faith believed that as the order for stay had been vacated by the JudicialCommissioner, he should ﬁrst send it to the Registrar of that court. It is obvious that the Superintendent wasgrossly in error and his action in not submitting the petition resulted in the unlawful removal of the petitioner outof the country. He, has made amends by tendering an unqualiﬁed apology and nothing further need be said aboutit. In Ebrahim Wazir Mavat v. The State of Bombay and Others and Noor Mohammad Ali Mohammad v. The Stateof Bombay and Others (Criminal Appeals Nos. 65 and 66 of 1952) in which we have just delivered judgment wehave held that section 7 of the Act is void as against a citizen of India being., an encroachment on his fundamentalright under article 19 (1) (e) of the Constitution. Following that decision we hold that the order of removal of thepetitioner is liable to be set aside.Mr. Umrigar, who appeared for the petitioner, pointed out that the Judicial Commissioner has already held thatthe petitioner is a citizen of India and that it will serve no useful purpose by remanding 946 the case to him for an.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/13.h/020IIVHTTR1954NS95295C3ebruar95wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml610 9/12/2EBRAHM VAZR MAAT V.

The Solicitor-General on behalf of the Union of India has read to us the order of theJudicial Commissioner and admits that this is so. It is, therefore, not necessary to adopt the course that we havetaken in the aforesaid a peals involving the validity of section 7. We accordingly hold that the order passed againstthe petitioner is void and set it aside.Mr. Umrigar requests that the order should be communicated to the petitioner through the High Commissioner forIndia in Karachi to whom the petitioner sent a representation praying that he should be allowed to return to India.This request is granted.Criminal Appeals Nos. 65 and 66 of 1952, No, 5 of 1953 and No. 19 of 1953 and Petitions No. 170 of 1952, No. 19 of1953 and No. 57 of 1953.DAs J.-I regret I am unable to agree with the judgment just delivered.Four Criminal Appeals namely, Criminal Appeals Nos. 65 and 66 of 1952, No. 5 of 1953 and No. 19 of 1953 and threeCriminal Miscellaneous Petitions, namely Petition No. 170 of 1952, No. 19 of 1953 and No. 57 of 1953, were postedfor hearing and were heard by us one after another. In each one of those appeals and petitions the appellants orthe petitioners, as the case may be, challenged the constitutional validity of the Inﬂux from Pakistan (Control)Act,1949 (Act XXIII of 1949).Learned advocate appearing in support of petitions No. 170 of 1952 and No. 19 of 1953 asked for leave to withdrawthem with liberty to ﬁle fresh' petitions in the High Court.Such leave having been given nothing further need be said about those two petitions.The facts of each of the remaining appeals and the remaining petition have been set out in the judgment justdelivered,, and need not be repeated. Suﬃce it to say that the appellants in Appeals Nos. 65 and 66 of 1952 ﬁrstcame to India from Pakistan on temporary permits issued by the High Commissioner for India in Pakistan butstayed on after the expiry of the 947 period and were convicted under section 5 of the Act. Later on they returned'to Pakistan on a temporary permit issued by the High Commissioner for Pakistan in India and eventually cameback to India on a permanent permit issued by the High Commissioner for India in Pakistan. That permanentpermit was cancelled on the. allegation that it had been obtained on the strength of a ""no objection"" certiﬁcatewhich had been obtained by them by the suppression of material facts, namely, that they had previously come. toIndia on a temporary permit. The appellant in Appeal No. 5 of 1953 came to India from Pakistan on a permanentpermit which was subsequently can- celled on the allegation that it had been obtained by fraud.The appellant in Appeal No. 19 of 1953 came to India from Pakistan without any permit and was prosecuted andconvicted under section 5 of the Act and later on arrested and sent back to Pakistan. The petitioner in Petition No.57 came to India without any permit at all. On this petitioner as well as on the appellants orders had been madeunder section 7 of the impugned Act to the eﬀect that unless they left India within the time speciﬁed in therespective orders they would be bodily removed from India. These orders were made on the ground that they hadentered India in violation of section 3 of the Act and/ or the rules and order made thereunder. Each of thesepersons claimed that they were citizens of India and complained that the orders made against them violated theirfundamental rights under Chapter III of the Constitution of India.It will be recalled that on the 15th August, 1947, there was a partition of India and two Dominions were formedunder the Indian, Independence Act, 1947. A grave emergency arose on the partition of India resulting in mass-migration of population from one Dominion to the other accompanied by riots, arson, murder, rape and loot.Intense bitterness and hatred were generated in the minds of the people of one Dominion against those of theother Dominion. Even in one Dominion there was suspicion in the 948 minds of the members of one communityagainst those of the other. In those circumstances the uncontrolled and indiscriminate entry of persons, Hindu orMuslim, from Pakistan into India was naturally regarded as fraught with the possibility of espionage and sabotagethe prevention of which was essential for the security of the Dominion of India. Further an uncontrolled entry oflarge numbers of people was calculated to place and in fact placed a tremendous strain on the economy of Indiaand on the law and order situation in the country. It was in order to prevent such result that it was necessary toexercise some control over such inﬂux of persons from Pakistan into India.Accordingly, the Inﬂux from West Pakistan (Control) Ordinance (XVII of 1949) was promulgated on the 19th July1948, by the Governor-General in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 42 of the Government ofIndia Act, 1935. The preamble to that Ordinance recited that an emergency had arisen which made it necessary to.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/13.h/020IIVHTTR1954NS95295C3ebruar95wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml710 9/12/2EBRAHM VAZR MAAT V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY & OS [] IC 13; AIR 14 SC 29; 14 SR 93 (15 Fy 14)control the admission into and regulate the movements in India of persons from Pakistan. Thereafter the Inﬂuxfrom Pakistan (Control) Ordinance (XXXIV of 1948) was issued on the 10th November, 1948, replacing the earlierOrdinance. This Ordinance applied to persons entering into India from both West Pakistan and East Pakistan. Itsubstantially reproduced all the sections of the previous Ordinance-.Finally, on the 22nd April, 1949, the Inﬂux from Pakistan (Control) Act (XXIII of 1949) replaced the secondOrdinance.Sections 3 and 7 of this Act substantially reproduced the provisions of sections 3 and 7 of the Ordinance. ThePermit System Rules of 1948 were replaced on the 20th May, 1949, by the Permit System Rules of 1949. This Act,however, was repealed on the 15th October, 1952, by Act LXVI of 1952.Section 3 of this repealing Act, however, expressly preserved the application of section 6 of the General ClausesAct, 1897. Although the Inﬂux from Pakistan (Control) Act, 1949 has been repealed and the number of personswho, like the appellants and the petitioners before us. are aﬀected by that Act is small, nevertheless the matterhas to 949 be scrutinised closely, for our decision may conceivably aﬀect the passport regulations which havereplaced the permit system.The contention advanced in these appeals and the petition is that sections 3 and 7 of the Act have, since thecommencement of the Constitution, become void in that they violate the fundamental rights guaranteed byarticles 14 and 19(1) (d) and (e) of the Constitution. The provisions of these two sections, which have beensuﬃciently set out in the judgment just delivered, will at once show that they applied to all persons coming fromPakistan,, whether they were citizens or noncitizens and irrespective of the community to which they belonged orthe religion which they professed. It will also appear that, as regards citizens, they did not touch all citizens butaﬀected only such of them as came from Pakistan, whether they were Hindus, Muslims or Christians. It is,therefore, quite clear that the Act applied to a small well deﬁned class of persons who were grouped together onan obviously reasonable basis of classiﬁcation as explained in the previous decisions of this court. In this view ofthe matter no question of unconstitutional discrimination can arise at all and, indeed, the plea based on the equalprotection clause of the Constitution has not been seriously pressed. The main contest has centred round thequestion whether these two sections oﬀend against the provisions of article 19(1)(d) and (e) of the Constitution.The learned Solicitor-General appearing for the respondents contends that those sections are protected by article19(5) as being reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the rights guaranteed by sub-clauses (d) and (e) of clause(1) of that article. In State of Madras v. V. G. Row (1) Patanjali Sastri C.J. observed:- "" It is important in this contextto bear in mind that the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each individual statuteimpugned, and no abstract standard, or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as, applicable to allcases.(1) [ 1952] 3 S.C.R. 597 at p. 607.123 950 The nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed,the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, theprevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the,judicial verdict. In evaluating such elusive factors andforming-their own conception of what is reasonable, in all the circumstances of a given case, it is inevitable thatthe social philosophy and the scale of values of the judges participating in the decision should play an importantpart, and the limit to their interference with legislative judgment I in such cases can only be dictated by their senseof responsibility and self restraint and the sobering reﬂection that the Constitution is meant not only for people oftheir way of thinking but for all, and that the majority of the elected representatives, of the people have,' inauthorising the imposition of the restrictions, considered them to be reasonable."" The impugned sections have,therefore, to be examined in the light of the above observations.I ﬁnd nothing unconstitutional about section 3 of the impugned Act It does not debar the entry of any personabsolutely. It only requires that a person entering India from any place in Pakistan must be in possession of apermit or a valid passport or be exempted from such requirements.Passport regulations obtain in every civilized country including even those the constitutions whereof confer similarfundamental rights on their citizens, e.g., Switzerland (articles 43-45), Wiener Germany (article III), Czechoslovakia(article 108), Jugoslavia (article 10), Danzig (article 75) and Albania (section 202). Such regula- tions serve to checkup the persons who enter the territories of the State and are necessary for the safety of the State. Seeing that such.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/13.h/020IIVHTTR1954NS95295C3ebruar95wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml810 9/12/2EBRAHM VAZR MAAT V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY & OS [] IC 13; AIR 14 SC 29; 14 SR 93 (15 Fy 14)regulations obtain everywhere and have a deﬁnite utility for the protection of the general public by securing thesafety of the State, I have no manner of doubt in my mind that such restrictions as are.contemplated by section 3 must be regarded as reasonable restrictions permissible under 951 clause (5) of article19 of the Constitution. Indeed, the objection of section 3 has not been seriously pressed before us.The main objection urged by learned counsel appearing in support of these appeals and petitions was directed tothe question of the validity of section 7. In the' ﬁrst place, it is clear that no objection can be taken to section 7 in sofar as it aﬀected persons who were 'not citizens of India, for article 19 guarantees certain fundamental rights to thecitizens of India only. In the next place, this section did not aﬀect all citizens but touched only a well deﬁned smallclass of citizens, namely, those who went to Pakistan and intended to return to India. The question is whether quathese citizens section 7 can also be regarded as a reasonable restriction within the meaning of clause (5) of article19. The High Court of Bombay has held, and in my opinion quite correctly, that the provisions of section 7 cannotbut be regarded as consequential to the provisions of section 3. Suppose at the check-post a person from Pakistan,whether a, citizen or not, tried to cross the border without a permit. Surely, the oﬃcer at the check-post wouldhave been well within the law to prevent a violation of section 3 of the Act and with that end in view to preventthat person, who had no permit, from crossing the border and entering India. I have no doubt that the oﬃcermight also have prevented a person from Pakistan from crossing the border if he suspected that the permitproduced by the person was forged or otherwise irregular and left him to take up the matter with the higherauthorities from Pakistan. Suppose the man who sought to enter India without a permit or with a permit whichwas suspected to spurious forcibly crossed the border and took a step or two on our side of the line, the Indianoﬃcer would certainty have been entitled to throw him back to the other side of the line. Surely, such a personcould not be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong and could not be heard to say that, in suchcircumstances, he had, by his wrong doing, acquired a better right than the person 952 who had not the temerityto violate the provisions of section 3. If this is so then, logically, I can see no diﬀerence if the man ran into theIndian territory for some distance and the Indian oﬃcer ran after him, overtook him and took him back to thecheck-post and pushed him out of our side of the line. It is, futile,, in such a situation, to expect or to say that theoﬃcer should have held a judicial enquiry and come to a judicial decision after hearing an argument as to thevalidity of the permit or as to the status of the permit holder or the fundamental rights of a, citizen Of India tomove freely in India and to settle anywhere he liked in India. The truth and substance of the matter are that inacting in the way indicated above the oﬃcer simply performed an executive act and prevented a person who heldno permit or held a permit which appeared to the oﬃcer to be spurious from entering India from Pakistan inviolation of section 3 of the Act. To throw out such a person was not. to inﬂict any punishment on him or to do himany greater injury than what was imposed on or done to a person who, not having a permit, was stopped at thecheck- post and not allowed to enter India at all. The man thus thrown out was placed under no greater disabilitythan the man who had initially been prevented from entering India at the check-post barrier. In both cases such aperson might, while staying in Pakistan, have taken steps to obtain a permanent permit upon proof of his status asan Indian citizen and if such permit was illegally withheld from him he might have through some agent in Indiataken proceedings in Indian courts' for appropriate reliefs. To my mind the position of the person who,enteredIndia on a temporary permit but who, in violation of the rules or order made under the Act stayed on after theperiod of the permit expired, was, as from that date, logically the same as that of the person who entered Indiawithout a permit. To arrest such a person, after the expiry of the period of the temporary permit, with a view tosending him back back to where he came from and to actually send him back there did not involve or 953constitute a judicial act at all but Was a rough and ready executive act for enforcing and giving eﬀect to theprovisions of section 3 of the Act. To arrest and send such a person back to Pakistan was not to inﬂict a punishmentbut was only to restore the status quo and to put him back to the position he would have been in but for his illegalact. In my opinion the act, authorized by section 7 was in essence.a purely executive act for implementing theprovisions of section 3. Without such a provision it would have been impossible for the State to control theadmission into India of persons from Pakistan and to prevent the concomitant dangers referred to above. The actauthorised by the section being an executive act, discretion had perforce to bib left to the executive Governmentwhich, by reason of the information available to it"" was in a much better position than the courts to know andjudge the antecedents of such a person and his ultimate purpose.' Suppose an Indian, citizen, no matter whetherhe was a Hindu or a Muslim, had entered India from Pakistan without a permit and suppose he was, uponconﬁdential reports which:could not be safely disclosed, suspected to be engaged in espionage in the interests of Pakistan, would it havebeen safe enough in those hectic days to have only prosecuted him under section 5 and inﬂicted on him a ﬁne ofrupees one thousand or a term of imprisonment not exceeding a year and then to have left him free, after the term.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/13.h/020IIVHTTR1954NS95295C3ebruar95wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml910 9/12/2EBRAHM VAZR MAAT V.

It cannot ,be overlooked that there are. long common borders between Pakistan and Indiaboth on the west and on the east.The Kashmir situation had also -aggravated the emergency brought about by the partition of India. Having regardto all, the circumstances, the tension, bitterness and hatred between the two countries that were generated at,thetime of the partition and all which must enter into the judicial verdict, the provisions of section 7 appear to me tohave been eminently reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of the 954 general public upon the exerciseby Indian' citizen coming from Pakistan without a permit of the rights conferred by article 19(1)(d) and (e) of theConstitution. The Indian citizen who was thrown out for not having the proper permit or who was suspected tohave violated the provisions of the Act was placed in no worse position than an Indian citizen who, not having apermit, had not been permitted to enter into India at all. They were by no means without remedy.They could from the other side of the border take steps under the rules to obtain valid permanent permits uponproof of their citizenship of India and if such permits were.illegally withheld from them they could move the appropriate High Court under article 226 or even this court underarticle 32 while they were outside India and might, on proof of their citizenship, have got appropriate writs ororders directing the State or its -oﬃcers to issue suitable permits and to desist from otherwise preventing themfrom entering India or interfering with their movement while in India. It is said that if such a person would havebeen entitled to a permit on proof of his status as an Indian citizen then why should he have Been thrown out at allunless and until he failed to establish his claim to Indian citizenship ? There occur to my mind several answers tothis question. In the ﬁrst place, it would have been putting a premium on wrong doing. In the second place, theperson would have been left free to carry on his secret activities, if any, while judicial proceedings would have beengoing on for ascertaining his status. In the third place, if the person could not be thrown out before his status hadbeen judicially determined there would have been no incentive on his part to take proceedings in court to establishhis status and it would have thrown upon the State the duty of initiating proceedings and of discharging the onusof proving the negative fact, of his not being a citizen of India. In view of all the circumstances prevailing at thetime the law was enacted and remained in force and in view of the considerations herein before alluded to I haveno' doubt in ray mind --except What 955 arises out of my respect for the opinions of my Lord and other learnedbrothers-that the provisions of section 7 were necessary and reasonable and fell within clause (5) of article 19.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.-The question in this case is whether section497 of the Indian Penal Code contravenes articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.The appellant is being prosecuted for adultery under section 497 of the Indian Penal Code. As soon as thecomplaint was ﬁled he applied to the High Court of Bombay to determine the constitutional question mentionedabove under article 228 of the Constitution. The High Court decided against him but granted him a certiﬁcateunder articles 132 (1) and 134 (1) (c).Under section 497 the oﬀence of adultery can only be committed by a man but in the absence of any provision tothe contrary the woman would be punishable as an abettor.The last sentence in section 497 prohibits this. It runs- ""In such case the wife shall not be punishable as an abettor.""It is said that this oﬀends articles 14 and 15.The portion of article 15 on which the appellant relies is this:www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 18.html/020959529539512 9/12/2YUSUF ABDUL AZIZ V.

But what he overlooks isthat is subject to clause (3) which runs ""Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any specialprovision for women.......... "" The provision complained of is a special provision and it is made for women, thereforeit is saved by clause (3).It was argued that clause (3) should be conﬁned to provisions which are beneﬁcial to women and cannot be used togive them a licence to commit and abet crimes. We are unable to read any such restriction into the clause ; nor arewe able to agree that a 932 provision which prohibits punishment is tantamount ,to a licence to commit theoﬀence of which punishment has been prohibited.Article 14 is general and must be read with the other provisions which set out the ambit of fundamental rights.Sex is a sound classiﬁcation and although there can be no discriminate in general on that ground, the Constitutionitself provides for special provisions in the case of women and children. The two articles read together validate theimpugned clause in section 497 of the Indian Penal Code.The appellant is not a citizen of India. It was argued that he could not invoke articles 14 and 15 for that reason. TheHigh Court held otherwise. It is not necessary for us to decide this question in view of our decision on the otherissue.The appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed.Agent for respondent No.1"

THE STATE OF ANDHRA [1954] INSC 19; AIR 1954 SC 314; 1954 SCR 1117 (11 March 1954).pdf,"Held, that the Madras General Sales Tax Act (IX of 1939), is not ultra vires the Government of India Act, 1935 asentry 48 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1936 was wide enough to cover a lawimposing 'a tax on the purchaser of goods as well as on the seller.Held, also that inasmuch as there was nothing to suggest that the purchasers of other commodities were similarlysituated as the purchasers of bides and skins in the present case the Act 1118 was not void under art. 14 of theConstitution on the ground that the impugned Act singles Out for taxing purchaser of certain speciﬁedcommodities only but leaves out purchasers of Mother commodities.Article 14 does not forbid classiﬁcation for legislative purposes provided such classiﬁcation is based on somediﬀerentia having a reasonable relation to the object and purpose of the law in question.Rule 16(5) framed under the Act contravenes the provisions of s. 5(vi) of the Act but this sub-rule is severable anddoes not aﬀect the validity of the rules which may otherwise lie within the ambit of the Act.Chiranjit Lal Chowdhury v. The Union of India ([ 1950] S.C.R.869)relied upon.","-I (a) The Provincial Legislature had no powerunder the Government of India Act of 1935 to enact a law imposing a tax on purchasers;(b) The liability to pay tax on sales is thrown on the purchaser not by the statute but by the rules. This is anunconstitutional delegation by the legislature of its functions to the executive and the imposition of ,the tax isaccordingly illegal;(c) The Act has become void under article 14 of the Constitution, as it singles out for taxation purchasers in sometrades and is, therefore, discriminatory; and (d) The rules framed under the Act are inconsistent with theprovisions enacted in the body of the Act and are void.The High Court repelled each of the aforesaid grounds except that under item (d). It held that rule 16(5) was ultravires in that it oﬀended against section 5 (vi) of the Act and dismissed their applications. Hence the presentappeals by the appellants under the certiﬁcate granted by the High Court that it was a ﬁt case for appeal to thiscourt.Learned advocate appearing in support of these appeals has not pressed the objection under item (b) but hasinsisted on the remaining grounds of objection. In our opinion the decisions of the High Court on those groundsare substantially well-founded and correct. On the question of legislative competency the learned advocate drewour 'attention to entry 54 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and argued that this entryclearly indicated that entry 48 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the -Government of India Act, 1935; underwhich the 145 1120 impugned Act was passed, was much narrower in its scope and could not be read as authorisein a the making of a law with respect to taxes on the purchase of goods. This argument appears to us to befallacious, for the intention of the Constituent Assembly as expressed in entry 54 in List II of the Seventh Scheduleto the Constitution cannot be a guide for ascertaining the intention of a totally, diﬀerent body, namely, the BritishParliament, in enacting entry 48 in List 11 of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935. Further,we agree with the High Court that entry 48 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, on aproper construction, was wide enough to cover a law imposing tax on the purchaser of goods as well and that theConstituent Assembly in entry 54 of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution accepted this liberalconstruction of the corresponding entry 48 and expressed in clearer language what was implicit in thatcorresponding entry.The next point urged by the learned advocate was founded on article 14 of the Constitution. The appellants'grievance is that the impugned -Act singles out for taxing purchasers of certain speciﬁed commodities only butleaves out purchasers of all other commodities. The principle underlying the equal protection clause of theConstitution has been dealt with and explained in Chiranjitlal Chowdhury v. The Union of India (1) and severalsubsequent cases and need not be reiterated.It is well,settled that the guarantee of equal protection of laws doesnot require that the same law should be made applicable to all persons. Article 14, it has been said, does not forbidclassiﬁcation for legislative purposes, provided that such classiﬁcation is based on some diﬀerentia having areasonable relation to the object and purpose of the law in question.

THE ST ATE OF ANDHRA [14] INSC 19; AIR 14 SC 34; 14 SCR 17 ( 11 Ma …which decided Chiranjitlal Chowdhury's case, there is a strong presumption in favour of the validity of legislativeclassiﬁcation and it is for those who challenge it as (1) [ 1950] S.C.R.1121 unconstitutional to allege and prove beyond all doubt that the legislation arbitrarily discriminates betweendiﬀerent persons similarly circumstanced. There is no material on the record before us to suggest that thepurchasers of other commodities are similarly situated as the purchasers of hides and skins. The majority decisionin Chiranjitlal Chowdhury's case(1) clearly applies to the case before us and there is no getting away from theposition that the appellants before us have not discharged the burden of proof that, according to the majoritydecision, was upon them to do.Lastly, the learned advocate urges that rule 16(5) clearly contravenes the provisions of section 5(vi) of the Act.This sub-rule has been held to be ultra vires by, the High Court and, indeed, the learned Advocate-General ofMadras did not in the High Court, as before ,us, dispute that rule 16(5) was repugnant to section 5(vi). That sub-rule, however, aﬀects only unlicensed dealers and the appellants who are admittedly licensed dealers are notaﬀected by that sub-rule. Further, it has not been suggested before us that the appellants were ever called upon topay any tax on purchase of hides or skins in respect of Which tax had been previously paid by some prior purchaser.That sub-rule is clearly severable and cannot aﬀect the validity of the rules which may otherwise be within theambit of the Act.Our attention has not been drawn to any other inﬁrmity in the rules.In the premises there is no substance in these appeals which must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.Appeals dismissed.Agent for the respondent and for the interveners, States of Madras, Mysore and Bihar: R.

He was accompanied by, 978 Daud Hassam another brother-in-law and both travelled toMombasa by car. From Mombasa they took a boat on August 30, and reached Colombo on September 1 1.

The car was delivered to the appellant on October 1, after he had paid Rs. 2,700 as custom duty and a cashdeposit of Rs. 10,000 by way of security as the appellant intended to take the car back to Durban on his return. Theparty motored to Nardana on October 7, passing through Bangalore, Poona, Nasik and Dhulia. From there theytravelled by train and reached Sarsa on October 8. The car was booked in an open truck from Nardana to Anandwhere it was taken delivery of and then driven to Sarsa.One Ratansing Kalusing Raol, Senior Police Inspector of Nadiad town, having noticed the car bearing no Indiannumber passing in the town instructed policemen to keep a watch.The appellants ordered to appear before the Sub-Inspector on October 12. On being questioned he stated that hisfamily was the original inhabitant of Jamnagar State but for the last 60 years they were doing the business ofcontractors for purchasing and selling land in Durban. His brother Daud Issa was, however, serving in Bombay. Hegave details of the journey performed by him and his companion and produced passports, as also the receipts forpaying custom duty and the deposit. On October 15, Head Constable Ajit Singh, informed Raol that someunknown person had come to the shop of Umarbhai jeweller with a large quantity of gold.Accordingly the police visited the shop of the jeweller and his brother (also a jeweller) and came to know that goldhad been given to him by the appellant to be melted. This gold along with some other gold kept at another placewas seized by the police. The police also took possession of the car.The entire quantity of gold seized was 27731 tolas the value of which is roughly estimated at Rs. 3 lakhs.Proceedings under action 20 of the Indian Telegraph Act were instituted 979 against the appellant and others onthe assumption that the wireless set in the car was a transmitter but they were dropped when it was foundotherwise. The car was thoroughly examined but nothing incriminating was found. The appellant was alsodetained under the Public Securities Act but was released. Ultimately on January 2, 1948, he along with others wasprosecuted on the complaint of Raol for an oﬀence under section 61 E of the Bombay District Police Act (IV of1890) read with section 109 of the Indian Penal Code.Section 61E says:- "" Whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner, or oﬀers for sale or pawn, anythingwhich there is reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained, shall, if he fails to account forsuch possession or act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, be punished with imprisonment for a term which mayextend to three months or with ﬁne which may extend to one hundred rupees."" He was convicted by theMagistrate and sentenced to a ﬁne of Rs. 100 and the gold was directed to be conﬁscated under section 517 of theCode of Criminal Procedure. The other accused who were charged with abetment were acquitted,. The Magistratetook the view that there wag no direct evidence to show that the accused had committed theft or had obtainedproperty fraudulently but there were in his opinion circumstances which led to the reasonable belief that the goldin question was either stolen or was fraudulently obtained. The Sessions Judge held that although the possessionof the gold was highly suspicious, nevertheless it did not constitute suﬃcient ground for a reasonable belief thatthe property was either stolen or was fraudulently obtained. He accordingly set aside the conviction and sentenceand ordered the gold to be restored to the appellant. The High Court in appeal by the State did not accept theprosecution story that the gold was brought into India by the appellant in his motor-car, but held agreeing with theMagistrate that from the circumstances there was reason to believe that he was in possession of gold which waseither stolen property or property 980 fraudulently obtained. The High Court did not accept the explanation of theappellant that his father had brought the gold to Sarsa from time to time when he visited his native place. Asregards the order of conﬁscation under section 517, the High Court held that it was not necessary that the propertyconﬁscated must be the property in relation to which an oﬀence appears to have been committed but it wasenough if ,the property is produced before the court. In this view the acquittal was set aside and the order of theMagistrate was restored.Mr. Chatterjee on behalf of the appellant stated at the outset that he was not prepared to concede that theappellant's conviction was right but he proceeded on the assumption that even if it was so, section 517 had noapplication to the case and the court had no jurisdiction to pass the order of conﬁscation of the gold. He also urgedthat 'in any, view of the matter the order of conﬁscation was not a proper order in the circumstances of this case.Section 517(1) reads thus:- When an inquiry or a trial in any criminal court is concluded, the court may make suchorder as it thinks ﬁt for the disposal (by destruction, conﬁscation, or delivery to any person claiming to be entitledg/in/cs/cn/IC/14/20./SULESHTT1954NS95195C7arc95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS95html23 9/12/ 2020MAN ISA V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY [] IC 20; AIR 14 SC 32; 14 SR 96 (11 Mh 14)to possession thereof or otherwise) of any property or document produced before it or in its custody or regardingwhich any oﬀence appears to.have been committed, or which has been used for the commission of any oﬀence."" The section on a plain readingshows that upon the conclusion of an inquiry or trial the court is empowered to make an order for disposal of anyproperty or document produced before it or in-its custody, or regarding which any oﬀence appears to have beencommitted, or which has been used for the commission of an oﬀence.The section also shows that the power of the court extends to destruction, conﬁscation or delivery to any 981person claiming to be entitled to possession of such property.Mr. Chatterjee contended that the gold after it was seized by the Police was sent to the Treasury and was neverproduced before the court. We do not think that the evidence on this point is clear and deﬁnite. This point doesnot appear to have been raised before the courts below.The High Court justiﬁed the order on the ground that the property was produced before the court and held that itwas not necessary to ﬁnd before passing the order that "" any oﬀence appears to have been committed "" in respectof it.It is clear to us that the property was not one regarding which any oﬀence appears to have been committed, orwhich has been used for the commission of any oﬀence. Now the power of the court no doubt extends toconﬁscation of property in the custody of the court but it is not every case in which the court must necessarily passan order of conﬁscation irrespective of the circumstances of the case.It is possible to conceive of cases where the subject matter of the oﬀence may be property which under the lawrelating to that oﬀence is liable to be conﬁscated as a punishment on conviction. Assuming therefore that thecourt had jurisdiction to pass an order regarding the disposal of the gold, it seems to us that the order ofconﬁscation was not an appropriate order in the circumstances of this case.Section 517 contains a general provision for disposal of the property in the circumstances mentioned in the latterpart of the section. Section 61E by itself does not empower the court to impose the penalty of conﬁscation and thesentence of imprisonment and ﬁne authorized by the section is a nominal sentence for the obvious reason that thesection proceeds upon the mere belief that the property in possession of the person is stolen property or propertyfraudulently obtained possession of which is not satisfactorily accounted for. It is an oﬀence under the local PoliceAct and not under an Act which contains any substantive provision such as the Sea Customs Act imposing thepenalty of conﬁscation. Conﬁscation is not the only mode of disposal under section 517 and is singularly 127 982inappropriate in a case where the accused is prosecuted for an oﬀence punishable with a maximum sentence of 3months and a ﬁne of Es. 100. It was certainly open to the court to order the property to be delivered to the personclaiming to be entitled to its possession. Here the gold was found from the possession of the appellant, and thecourt was not called upon to consider any rival claims about its possession. Admittedly ,there was no evidence toprove that it was stolen, or that it was fraudulently obtained and all that was found was that there was reason tobelieve that it was stolen or fraudulently obtained and that the appellant failed to account for its possession to thesatisfaction of the court. The High Court thought that the gold was smuggled from Africa into India but assumingthis to be so, its conﬁscation under section 517 upon the existence of a mere belief required to sustain a convictionunder section 61 E was palpably harsh and unreasonable. We hold, therefore, that the order of conﬁscation of goldcannot be supported.We accordingly set aside the order of conﬁscation and direct that the, gold seized from the appellant's possessionshall be restored to him.Appeal allowed.Agent for the respondent: B.

Regulation of tax on 'sale or purchase of essential goods: No law made after the commencement ofthis Act by the Legislature of a State imposing, or authorising the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase ofany goods declared by this Act to be essential for the life' of the community shall have eﬀect unless it has beenreserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent."" The petitioners are dealers in coarsecloth and medium cloth and their contention is that these commodities having been declared as essential, for thelife of the community they are not liable to pay sales tax on them. In the petition an allegation has been' made thatsection 3 of Act LII of 1952 is in direct contravention of article 286(3) of the Constitution. There 957 does notappear to be any substance in this contention.Section 3 is in line with article 286(3) and there is no inconsistency between that section and the relevant provisionof the Constitution. The petitioners are sought to be taxed under the Ordinance XXXIII of 2006, which, as anexisting law, has been continued by article 372. The question is whether that Ordinance contravenes the provisionsof article 286(3) or has since been altered, repealed or amended by any competent legislative authority..It is quite clear that section 3 of Act LII of 1952 does not aﬀect the Ordinance', for the Ordinance was not madeafter the commencement of that Act. The only question, therefore, is whether the Ordinance runs counter toclause (8) of article 286 of the Constitution. A perusal of that clause will at once indicate that clause contemplatesa post- Constitution law, for it must be a law made by a ""I Legislature of a State "" which must refer to theLegislature of a State created by the Constitution. Further, and what is more important, it contemplates a lawwhich can be but has not been reserved for the consideration of the President and has not received his assent. Thisprovision clearly points to post-Constitution law, for there can be no question of an existing law continued byarticle 372 being reserved for the consideration of the President for receiving his assent. As we are concerned inthis application with a pre-Constitution law, it is not necessary for us to express any opinion as to the validity orotherwise of a law made after the commencement of the Constitution but before the coming into operation of ActLII of 1952.The result, therefore, is that there is no substance in this petition and we dismiss it with costs.Petition dimissed.Agent for the petitioners: Sardar Singh.Agent for respondent No. 1: R.

The facts material for our present purpose liewithin a narrow compass and may be stated as follows: The principal respondents are certain idols, represented bytheir managing Shebait Ram Govinda Roy. The idols are the family deities of the Roys of Bonpash in the district of.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/22.h/02095950958rcwwwiiofindirasee95tml14 9/12/2SRIMA TI ORAMBA SUNDARI DASI V. SRI SRI ISW AR GOP AL JIEU [14] INSC 22; AIR 14 SC 37; 14 SCR 92 (12 Mah …Burdwan, and the number of Shebaits being very large, there is a recognised usage in this family that theseniormost member amongst the descendants of the founder acts as the managing Shebait and it is he whomanages the endowed properties and looks after the due performance of the worship of the idols. It is notdisputed by the parties that it is within the competence of the managing Shebait to borrow money to meet thenecessities of the idols and to execute such documents as may be necessary for that purpose.Admittedly Adwaita Charan Roy was the managing Shebait of the deities from 1926 to 1930 and as Shebait, heexecuted a Hatchita in favour of one Nanitosh Chakraborty some time in April, 1928, on the basis of which hereceived advances of money from time to time from the latter. The last entry in the Hatchita was made in March,1929, and the total amount borrowed up to that date came up to Rs. 3,801. Adwaita died in March, 1930, and afterhis death, Satish Chandra Roy became the managing Shebait and continued to act as such till his death in 1940.There was an adjustment of accounts between Nanitosh, the creditor,in whose favour the Hatchita was executed,and Satish Chandra, the managing Shebait some time in October, 1931, and a sum of Rs. 5,068, having been founddue to the 128 990 creditor, Satish Chandra gave him a renewed Hatchita for that amount. It appears that whileAdwaita was still the managing Shebait, a suit was instituted by some of his co- Shebaits to remove him from hisoﬃce and pending the hearing of the suit, Ramjanaki Roy, another co-Shebait, was appointed a Receiver of thedebutter property by the court.With the permission of the court, Ramjanaki borrowed from the same Nanitosh Chakraborty -three sums ofmoney on three diﬀerent promissory notes executed respectively on the 27th September, 1929, 1st October, 1929,and 14th January, 1930.The suit was eventually dismissed for non-prosecution after Adwaita's death. Nanitosh died in 193 1, and in 1932)his two sons Aditya and Dhirendra, who ﬁgure as respondents 14 and 15 in these appeals, instituted two moneysuits against Satish Chnandra, the managing Shebait, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Burdwan, beingMoney Suits Nos. 261 and 262 of 1932, for recovery of the moneys due in respect of the Hatchita and thepromissory notes mentioned aforesaid.Both the suits were decreed on the basis of a compromise dated the 23rd July, 1933, and two consent decrees werepassed, one for a sum of Rs. 5,800, and the other for Rs.2,200, both payable in sixteen yearly instalments with a further stipulation that in default of payment of any one ofthe instalments, the whole or balance of the decretal amount would become due and payable in each. Theinstalments not having been paid in either of the cases both the decrees were put into execution. In ExecutionCases Nos. 76 and 77 of 1936, arising out of Money Suits Nos. 261 and 262 of 1932, the properties mentioned inSchedule Ka in each case were put up to sale and they were purchased ostensibly by the two decreeholders Adityaand Dhiren. Three years later, Execution Cases Nos. 17 and 18 of 1939 were started again in connection with thesaid decrees and this time the properties speciﬁed in Schedule Kha were attached and put up to sale and they werealso purchased by the Chakraborty decreeholders. Finally, in Execution Cases Nos. 163 of 1939 and 5 of 1940, theproperties described in Schedule GA were sold and 991 they were, knocked down to Srimati Oramba Sundari Dasi,who ﬁgures as the appellant in the appeals before us and who, it may be noted, is the wife of Aghore Nath Roy, ason of Adwaita, the former managing Shebait of the debutter estate.Subsequently, the decreeholders, who purchased Ka and Kha Schedule properties sold them by a registeredKobala to the said Oramba Sundari Dasi on the 26th of July, 1940. The result, therefore, was that the propertiesdescribed in the three Schedules came to vest in Oramba Sundari, the wife of Aghore Nath Roy. On the 28thAugust, 1941, the deities represented by some of the Shebaits ﬁled two applications under section 36 (6) (a) (ii) ofthe Bengal Money-Lenders Act praying for the reopening of the two compromise decrees mentioned aforesaidand the passing of. new installment decrees in accordance with the provisions of the Act. There were prayers alsofor restoration. to the deities of all the properties mentioned in Schedules, Ka, Kha and Ga which were purchasedin execution of the decrees. The principal opposite parties to these proceedings were the Chakrabortydecreeholders, Oramba Sundari, the ostensible purchaser, and Aghore Nath Roy, her husband.The allegations in the applications, in substance, were that the Chakrabortys were mere benamidars for AghoreNath Roy, who was the real lender and the real decreeholder in both these suits. It was alleged that Aghore NathRoy purchased these properties in the benami of the decreeholders in two out of the three execution proceedingsand in the benami of his wife Oramba Sundari in the third..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/22.h/02095950958rcwwwiiofindirasee95tml24 9/12/2SRIMA TI ORAMBA SUNDARI DASI V. SRI SRI ISW AR GOP AL JIEU [14] INSC 22; AIR 14 SC 37; 14 SCR 92 (12 Mah …The subsequent Kobala executed by the Chakrabortys in favour of Oramba . Sundari was also asserted to be aﬁctitious conveyance made in favour of Aghore Nath Roy in the name of his wife. In these circumstances, thejudgment-debtors prayed that they were entitled to have the two compromise decrees reopened and on thepassing of new instalment decrees to have the properties, which were in possession of the real decreeholder,restored to the deities in terms of section 36(2)(c) of the Bengal Money-Lenders Act. The trial judge decided 992 infavour of the judgment-debtors and granted their prayers in both the applications. Orders were made forreopening of the decrees and making of fresh decrees in their places in accordance with the provisions of theBengal Money-Lenders Act. Direction was also given for restoration of the properties mentioned in Schedules Ka,Kha and Ga to the deities under the provision of section 36(2)(c). Against this decision, Oramba Sundari took twoappeals to the High Court of Calcutta and the learned Judges, who heard the appeals, aﬃrmed the decision of thecourt below and dismissed both the appeals. Oramba Sundari has now come up in appeal to this court on thestrength of a certiﬁcate given by the High Court under sections 109 (a) and 110 of the Civil Procedure Code.Mr. Chatterjee who appeared in support of the appeals, has not challenged before us the ﬁndings of factconcurrently arrived at by the courts below, viz.,that the appellant Oramba Sundari was a mere benamidar for herhusband Aghore in respect of the purchase of Ga Schedule properties in court sale, and also that the Kobalaexecuted by the Chakrabortys in her favour on July 26, 1940, was a ﬁctitious transaction. The point, which he haspressed for our consideration, is that in a proceeding under section 36 of the Bengal Money-Lenders Act, it is notopen to the court to go behind the decree and launch an enquiry as to whether the decreeholders on record werein fact benamidars for another person. In other words, the contention is that, even if Aghore was proved to haveadvanced the money upon which the Chakrabortys obtained the decrees, in reopening the decrees and in workingout the rights of the parties in accordance with the provisions of the Bengal Money-Lenders Act the court couldtreat the Chakrabortys alone as the decreeholders. For a proper determination of this point, it is necessary toexamine the scope of section 36 of the Bengal Money-Lenders Act and the reliefs which the Court is competent togrant in terms of that section.Section, 36 of the Bengal Money-Lenders Act sets out the various powers which the court can exercise, 993 if it hasreason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers will give relief to the borrower as contemplated bythe Act; and one of the powers, which is mentioned in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of the section is to reopen anytransaction and take an account between the parties. The drafting of section 36 is indeed obscure and somewhatclumsy, but it is clear, as the Privy Council (1) has pointed out, that the power of reopening a transaction, ascontemplated by the section, extends to reopening of decrees as well. Sub-section (2) of section 36 containsdetailed provisions as to what the court may or may not do when a decree is reopened. It cannot be disputed thatthe court reopens a decree under section 36(2) only for the purpose and so far as it is necessary to give relief to theborrower in the manner provided for in the Act, namely, to release him from all liability for interest -in excess ofthe limits prescribed by section 30 of the Act. A new decree is passed only for the purpose of substituting themethod of accounting sanctioned by the Act for the calculations upon which the original decree was passed and togive an opportunity to the judgment-debtor to pay the decretal dues thus ascertained by instalments. But saveand except for these, the old decree as well as the adjudications made thereunder are not wiped out and theparties are not relegated to their rights and liabilities under the original cause of action (2). How the rights of theparties are to be adjusted and worked out when a decree hat; been reopened has been dealt with exhaustively inthe several clauses of section 36 (2) of the Bengal Money- Lenders Act, and an examination of these clauses makesit clear to our minds that an enquiry as to whether the decree- holder was in fact a benamidar for another person inrespect of the decree, does not come within the purview of these provisions. Clause (a) of section 36(2) empowersthe court to pass a new decree in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Obviously, this new decree is to bepassed in favour of the original decreeholder and only the calculations upon which the old (1) Vide Renula v.Manmatha, 72 I.A. 156.(2) Vide Bank of Commerce Ltd. v. Amulya Krishna Babu Roy Chowdhury [ 1944] F.C.R. 126.994 decree was based would be changed by substituting the statutory method of accounting in place of whatrested upon the contract between the parties. Clauses (b) and (C) contemplate cases where properties have beensold in execution of the original decree. If the purchaser is the decreeholder, himself and he is in possession of theproperty when the decree is reopened, it is incumbent upon the court to order restoration of these properties tothe judgment-debtor under clause (c). If, on the other hand, the properties had been acquired by strangers eitherby purchase at the execution sale or from the decreeholder purchaser, their interests would be protected if theyhave acquired these rights bona ﬁde as contemplated by clause (b). Under clause (d), the court has to order thepayment of the decretal amount in such instalments as it thinks proper, and clause (e) further imposes a duty on.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/22.h/02095950958rcwwwiiofindirasee95tml34 9/12/2SRIMA TI ORAMBA SUNDARI DASI V. SRI SRI ISW AR GOP AL JIEU [14] INSC 22; AIR 14 SC 37; 14 SCR 92 (12 Mah …the court to give a direction in such cases that if there is default in the payment of any one of the instalments, theproperties restored to the judgment-debtor under clause (e) would be put back into the possession of thedecreeholder. It is quite true that the object of restoring possession of the properties sold in execution of thedecree to the judgment- debtor is to enable the latter to pay oﬀ the decretal dues, but it is to be remembered thatthe sale itself is not annulled, and in case of default in payment of any of the instalments, the properties arereturned to the decreeholder purchaser. We agree that if the purchaser is a mere benamidar for the decreeholder,clause (b), subsection (2) of the section would not aﬀord protection to him in any way. He could not be regarded asa person other than the decreeholder acquiring rights bona ﬁde as contemplated by that clause. For-the purposeof giving eﬀect to clauses (b) and (c), therefore, the court has not only the right but is under a duty to make anenquiry as to whether the ostensible purchaser at the execution sale, or the person who purports to have acquiredan interest therein under a subsequent transfer from the decreeholder purchaser, has bonaﬁde acquired suchrights within the meaning of clause (b). But we do not agree with the learned 995 Judges of the High Court that inmaking a new decree under clause (a) of section 36(2) and giving the judgment-debtor consequential relief underclause (c) of the sub-section, the court can at all enter into the question as to whether the decreeholder on recordis himself a benamidar for another person in respect of the decree. Such enquiry, it seems to us, is altogetheroutside the purview of the diﬀerent clauses of section 36(2) of the Bengal Money- Lenders Act. These provisionsdo not recognise any other decreeholder than the one in whose favour the original decree was passed. It isbetween him and the judgment- debtor that the rights are to be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of theAct; to him would the instalments have to be paid under the new decree, and he alone would be compelled torestore the properties which he had purchased in execution proceedings. None but the decreeholder on record cangive a valid discharge or record satisfaction of the decree. This being the position, it is altogether immaterial, in ouropinion, that it was Aghore, the husband of the appellant, who, really advanced the money upon which thedecrees were obtained. We must treat the Chakrabortys and the Chakrabortys alone as the decreeholders and seeto what extent the provisions of the Act could be applied against them in the circumstances of the present case. Sofar as the properties described in Schedules Ka and Kha are concerned, it is not disputed that they were purchasedby the decreeholders themselves. No price was actually paid by the decreeholders, but the sale proceeds were setoﬀ against the decretal dues. The decreeholders, therefore, must be deemed to be the purchasers of theseproperties within the meaning of clause (c) of section 36(2); and as the subsequent conveyance of these propertiesin favour of Oramba Sundari, the appellant, has been held by both the courts below to be a ﬁctitious transaction,we must hold that Oramba Sundari did not bona ﬁde acquire any right which could be protected under clause (b)of section 36(2).With regard to these properties, therefore, the order for restoration of possession made by both the courts belowshould stand. As regards Ga 996 Schedule properties, however, Oramba Sundari was the purchaser at theexecution sale and whether or not the money for such purchase was paid by her husband becomes immaterial.This was not the property purchased by the decreeholders and there is no proof of the decreeholders being inpossession of the same either by themselves or through Oramba Sundari. In these circumstances, clause (e) ofsection 36(2) cannot be attracted in favour of judgment- debtors so far as this property is concerned and thepossession of it must remain with the appellant. We, therefore, allow the appeal in part and set aside the order forrestoration of possession made by the courts below in respect to the Ga Schedule property. The rest of thedecision of the High Court will stand. We make no order as to costs of these appeals.Appeal partly allowed."

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.1079 JAGANNADHADAS J.-These two applications are for relief under article 32 of the Constitution arising out ofsimilar and connected set of facts and are dealt with together.They'arise under the following circumstances. The Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies, Delhi State, lodgedinformation with the Inspector General, Delhi Special Police Establishment, to the following eﬀect. Messrs. DalmiaJain Airways Ltd. was registered in his oﬃce on the 9th July, 1946, with an authorised capital of Rs. 10 crores andwent into liquidation on the 13th June, 1952. An investigation into the aﬀairs of the company was ordered, by theGovernment and the report of the inspector appointed under section 138 of the Indian Companies Act indicatedthat an organised attempt was made from the inception of the company to misappropriate and embezzle thefunds of the company-and declare it to be substantial loss, and to conceal from the shareholders the true state ofaﬀairs by submitting false accounts and balance-sheets. Various dishonest and fraudulent transactions were alsodisclosed which show that false accounts with ﬁctitious entries and false records were being maintained and thatdishonest transfers of moneys had been made. It was accordingly alleged that oﬀences under sections 406, 408,409,'418, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 477(a) of the Indian Penal Code had been committed. It was also stated thatSeth R. K.Dalmia who was the Director and Chairman of Dalmia Jain Airways Ltd. has been controlling certain otherconcerns, viz., (1) Dalmia Cement & Paper Marketing Co., Ltd., (2) Dalmia Jain Aviation Ltd. now known as AsiaUdyog Ltd., and (3) Allen Berry & Co., Ltd., through his nominees- and that all these concerns were utilised in orderto commit the frauds. It was further stated therein by the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies that to determinethe extent of the fraud, it was necessary to get hold of books not only of Dalmia Jain Airways Ltd. but also of theallied concerns controlled by the Dalmia group, some of which are outside the Delhi State. Lists of the oﬃces andplaces in which and of the persons in whose custody the records may be available were furnished. Speedy 1401080 investigation was asked for. This information was recorded by the Special Police on the 19th November, 1953,as the First Information Report. On the basis thereof an application was made to the District Magistrate, Delhi,under section 96 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for the issue of warrants for the search of documents and in theplaces, as per schedules furnished. Permission to investigate in respect of some of the non-cognisable oﬀencesmentioned in the First Information Report was also asked for. On the same day, the District Magistrate orderedinvestigation of the oﬀences and issued warrants for simultaneous searches at as many as 34 places. The searcheswere made on the 25th November, 1953, and subsequent days and a voluminous mass of records was seized fromvarious places. The petitioners pray that the search warrants may be quashed as being absolutely illegal, and askfor return of the documents seized. In Petition No. 372 of 1953 there are four petitioners of whom the second is theDelhi Glass Works Ltd., and the ﬁrst the Deputy-General Manager thereof, the third its Secretary and the fourth ashareholder therein. In Petition No. 375 of 1953 there are ﬁve petitioners of whom the ﬁrst is Messrs. Allen Berry &Co., Ltd., second Asia Udyog Ltd., the third Shri R.

It will be seen that the petitioners in both the petitions belong to the fourconcerns, namely, (1) Delhi Glass Works Ltd' , (2) Messrs.Allen Berry & Co., Ltd., (3) Asia Udyog Ltd., and (4) Dalmia Jain Airways Ltd. The last three are stated- to beDalmia concerns but it does not appear from the records placed before us what exact connection Delhi Glass.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/24.h/0209595095wwwiiofindirasee95tml29 9/12/2M.

However, it is admittedly one of the places for which a search warrant was asked forand against which the First Information Report appears to have been lodged. In the petitions various questionswere raised. But such of them which raise only irregularities and illegalities of the searches and do not involve anyconstitutional violation are matters which may be more appropriately canvassed before the High Court onapplications under article 226 of the Constitution and we have declined to go into them. The petitioners have,therefore, conﬁned themselves before us to two grounds on which they challenge the constitutional validity,of thesearches. The contentions raised are that the fundamental rights of the petitioners under article 20(3) and article19(1)(f) have been violated by the searches in question.So far as the contention based on article 19(1)(f) is concerned we are unable to see that the petitioners have anyarguable case. Article 19(1)(f) declares the right of all citizens to acquire, hold and dispose of property subject tothe operation of any existing or future law in so far as it imposes reasonable restrictions, on the exercise of any ofthe rights conferred thereby, in the interests of general public. It is urged that the searches and seizures as eﬀectedin this case were unreasonable and constitute a serious restriction on the right of the various petitioners, inasmuchas their buildings were invaded, their documents taken away and their business and reputation aﬀected by theselargescale and allegedly arbitrary searches and that a law (section 96(1), Cr.P.C.) which authorises such searchesviolates the constitutional guarantee and is invalid. But, a search by itself is not a restriction on the right to holdand enjoy property. No doubt a seizure and carrying away is a restriction of the possession and enjoyment of theproperty seized. This, however, is only temporary and for the limited purpose of investigation. A search andseizure is, therefore, only a temporary interference with the right to hold the premises searched and the articlesseized.Statutory regulation in this behalf is necessary and reasonable restriction cannot per se be considered to beunconstitutional. The damage, if any caused by such temporary interference if found to be in excess of legalauthority is a matter for redress in other proceedings. We are unable to see how any question of violation. ofarticle 19(1) (f) is involved in this case in respect of the warrants in question which purport to be , under the ﬁrst1082 alternative of section 96(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.The only substantial question, therefore, that has been raised is the one relating to article 20(3) which runs asfollows:""No person accused of any oﬀence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself."" The argument urged beforeus is that a search to obtain documents, for investigation into an oﬀence is a compulsory procuring ofincriminatory evidence from the accused himself and is, therefore, hit by article 20(3) as unconstitutional andillegal. It is not disputed that, prima facIe, the article in question has nothing to indicate that it comprehendswithin its scope, the prohibition of searches and seizures of documents from the custody of an accused.But it is urged that this is necessarily implied therein by certain canons of liberal construction which are applicableto the interpretation of constitutional guarantees. In support of this line of argument great reliance has beenplaced upon American decisions in which similar questions were canvassed. The argument on behalf of thepetitioners is presented in the following way. The fundamental guarantee in article 20(3) comprehends within itsscope not merely oral testimony given by an accused in a criminal case pending against him, but also evidence ofwhatever character compelled out of a person who is or is likely to become incriminated thereby as an accused. It,therefore, extends not only to compelled production of documents by an accused from his possession, but also tosuch compelled production of oral or documentary evidence from any- other person who may becomeincriminated thereby as an accused in future proceedings. If this view of the content of article 20(3) is accepted,the next step in the argument presented is that a forcible search and seizure of documents is, for purposes ofconstitutional protection of this guarantee, on the same footing as a compelled production of the said documentsby the person from whom they are seized. This chain of reasoning, if accepted in its entirety, would rendersearches and seizures of documents and any 1083 statutory provisions in that behalf illegal and void, as being inviolation of the fundamental right under ArtiCle 20(3). The question thus raised is of farreaching importance andrequires careful consideration.Article 20(3) embodies the principle of protection against compulsion of self-incrimination which is one of thefundamental canons of the British system of criminal jurisprudence and which has been adopted by the Americansystem and incorporated as an article of its Constitution.It has also, to a substantial extent, been recognized in the Anglo Indian administration of criminal justice in thiscountry by incorporation into various statutory provisions..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/24.h/0209595095wwwiiofindirasee95tml39 9/12/2M. P . SHARMA & ORS V . SA TISH CHANDRA, DISTRICT MAGISTRA TE, DELHI, & ORS [14] INSC 24; AIR 14 SC 30; 14 …In order, therefore, to arrive at a correct appraisal of the scope and content of the doctrine and to judge to whatextent that was intended to be recognised by our Constitution-makers in article 20(3), it is necessary to have acursory view of the origin and scope of this doctrine and the implications thereof as understood in English law andin American law and as recognized in the Indian law.In English law, this principle of protection against self-incrimination had a historical origin. It resulted from afeeling of revulsion against the inquisitorial methods adoPted and the barbarous sentences imposed, by the Courtof Star Chamber, in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction. This came to a head in the case of John Lilburn(1) whichbrought about the abolition of the Star Chamber and the ﬁrm recognition of the principle that the accused shouldnot be put on oath and that no evidence should be taken from him. This principle, in course of time, developed intoits logical extensions, by way of privilege of witnesses against self-incrimination, when called for giving oraltestimony or for production of documents. A change was introduced by the Criminal Evidence Act of 1898 Bymaking an accused a competent witNess on his own behalf, if he applied for it. But so far as the oral testimony -ofwitnesses and the production of documents are concerned, the protection against (1) 3 State Trials 1315, self-incrimination continued as before. (See Phipson on Evidence, 9th Edition, pages 215 and 474).These principles, as they were before the statutory change in 1898, were carried into the American legal systemand became part of its common law. (See Wigmore on Evidence, vol. VIII, pages 301 to 303). This was later onincorporated into their Constitution by virtue of the Fifth Amendment thereof. The language of the FifthAmendment was considered by the American Courts as being wide enough to cover all the aspects of the principleof protection against self incrimination as administered under the English common law including oral testimony ofwitnesses and production of documents. (See Willis on Constitutional Law, pages 518 and 519). In course of timefurther extensions of that privilege were recognised by the courts relating to searches and seizures. It came to beheld that unreasonable searches and seizures of documents fell equally within the mischief of the Fourth and theFifth Amendments [ Boyd v. United States(1)] and that documents or other evidence so obtained were inadmissiblein evidence [ Weeks v. United States(2)].In the Indian law the extent to which this protection is recognised appears from the various relevant statutoryprovisions from time to time. Section III of Act XV of 1852 recognised that an accused in a criminal proceeding wasnot a competent or compellable witness to give evidence for or against himself This provision was repealed by theEvidence Act I of 1872. But meanwhile the Criminal Procedure Code of 1861 in sections 204 and 203 thereofrespectively provided that no oath shall be administered to the accused and that it shall be in the discretion of theMagistrate to examine him. The Criminal Procedure Code of 1872 by section 250 thereof made a generalquestioning, of the accused, after the witnesses for the prosecution had been examined, compulsory and section345 thereof provided that no oath or aﬃrmation shall be (1) 116 U.S. 6i6.(2) 232 U.S. .383.1085 administered to the accused person These features have been continued in the later Codes of CriminalProcedure and have been incorporated into section 342 of the present Criminal Procedure Code of 1898. The onlylater statutory change, so far, in this behalf, appears to be that brought about by section 7 of the Prevention ofCorruption Act, 1947. By virtue of that section an accused is a competent witness on his own application in respectof oﬀenses under that Act.So far as witnesses are concerned, section III of Act XV of 1852 also declared the protection of, witnesses againstcompulsion to answer incriminating questions. Shortly thereafter in 1855, this protection was modiﬁed by section32 of Act II of 1855 which made him compellable to answer even incriminating questions but provided immunityfrom arrest or prosecution on the basis of such evidence or any other kind of use thereof in criminal proceedingsexcept prosecution for giving false evidence. This position has been continued under section 132 of the EvidenceAct I of 1872 which is still in force. So far as documents are concerned, it does not appear that the Indian statutorylaw speciﬁcally recognised protection against production of incriminating documents until Evidence Act I of 1872was enacted which has a provision in this behalf in section 130 thereof. It is not quite clear whether this sectionwhich excludes parties to a suit applies to an accused. Thus so far as the Indian law is concerned it may be takenthat the protection against self-incrimination continues more or less as in the English common law, so far as theaccused and production of documents are concerned, but that it has been modiﬁed as regards oral testimony ofwitnesses, by introducing compulsion and providing immunity from prosecution on the basis of such compelledevidence..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/24.h/0209595095wwwiiofindirasee95tml49 9/12/2M. P . SHARMA & ORS V . SA TISH CHANDRA, DISTRICT MAGISTRA TE, DELHI, & ORS [14] INSC 24; AIR 14 SC 30; 14 …Since the time when the principle of protection against self-incrimination became established in English law and inother systems of law which have followed it, there has been considerable debate as to the utility thereof andserious doubts were held in some quarters that this principle has a tendency to defeat justice. In support of theprinciple it is claimed that the protection' 1086 of accused against -self-incrimination promotes activeinvestigation from external sources to ﬁnd out the truth and proof of alleged or suspected crime instead ofextortion of confessions on unveriﬁed suspicion. (See Wigmore on Evidence, Vol. VIII, page 309). It is also claimedthat that privilege in its application to witnesses as regards oral testimony and production of documents aﬀords tothem in general a free atmosphere in which they can be persuaded to come forward to furnish evidence in courtsand be of substantial help in elucidating truth in a case, with reference to material within their knowledge and intheir possession. (See Wigmore on Evidence, Vol. VIII, page 307).On the other hand, the opinion has been strongly held in some quarters that this rule has an undesirable eﬀect onsocial interests and that in the detection of crime, the State is confronted with overwhelming diﬃculties as a resultof this privilege. It is said this has become a hiding place of crime and has outlived its usefulness and that the rightsof accused persons are amply protected without this privilege and that no innocent person is in need of it. (SeeWigmore on Evidence, Vol.VIII, pages 314 and 315) Certain passages at pages 441 and 442 of Vol. I of Stephen'sHistory of the Criminal Law of England are also instructive in this context and show a similar divergence of opinion.In view of the above background, there is no inherent reason to construe the ambit of this fundamental right ascoprising a very wide range. Nor would it be legitimate to conﬁne it to the barely literal meaning of the wordsused, since it is a recognized doctrine that when appropriate a constitutional provision has to be liberallyconstrued, so as to advance the intendment thereof and to prevent its circumvention. Analysing the terms inwhich this right has been declared in our Constitution, it may be said to consist of the following components. (1) Itis a right pertaining to a person "" accused of an oﬀence (2) It is a protection against compulsion to be a witness"";and (3) It is a protection against such compulsion resulting in his giving evidence "" against himself "". The oases withwhich we are concerned have been 1087 presented to us on the footing that the persons against whom the searchwarrants were issued, were all of them persons against whom the First Information Report was lodged and whowere included in the category of accused therein and that therefore they are 'persons"" accused of an oﬀence""within the meaning of article 20(3) and also that the documents for whose search the warrants were issued, beingrequired for investigation into the alleged oﬀences, such searches were for incriminating material. It may benoticed that some of the accused enumerated in the First Information Report are incorporated companies. But noquestion has been raised before us that the protection does not apply to corporations or to documents belongingto them '-a question about which there has been considerable debate in the American Courts. On the abovefooting, therefore, the only substantial argument before us on this part of the case was that compelled productionof incriminating documents from the possession of an accused is compelling an accused to be a witness againsthimself. This argument accordingly raises mainly the issue relating to the scope and connotation of the second ofthe three components above stated Broadly stated the guarantee in article 20(3) is against ""testimonialcompulsion "". It is suggested that this is conﬁned to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial for an oﬀencewhen called to the witness-stand. We can see no reason to conﬁne the content of the constitutional guarantee tothis barely literal import. So to limit it would be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to miss thesubstance for the sound as stated in certain American decisions. The phrase used in article 20(3) is "" to be awitness."" A person can "" be a witness "" not merely by giving oral evidence but also. by producing documents ormaking intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb witness (see section 119 of the Evidence Act) or the like."" To be a witness "" is nothing more than "" to furnish evidence "", and such evidence can be furnished through the lipsor by production of a thing or of a document or in other modes. So far as 141 1088 production of documents isconcerned, no doubt section 139 of the Evidence Act says that a person producing a document on summons is nota witness. But that section is meant to regulate the right of cross-examination. It is not a guide to the connotationof the word "" witness"", which must 'be understood in its natural sense, i.e., as referring to a person who furnishesevidence. Indeed, every positive volitional act which furnishes evidence is testimony, and testimonial compulsionconnotes coercion which procures the positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as opposed to the,negative attitude of silence or submission on his part. Nor is there any reason to think that the protection inrespect of the evidence so procured is conﬁned to what transpires at the trial in the court room.The phrase used in article 20(3) is ""to be a witness"" and not to ""appear as a witness"": It follows that the protectionaﬀorded to an accused in so far as it is related to the phrase ""to be a witness' is not merely in respect of testimonialcompulsion in the court room but may well extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from him. It isavailable therefore to a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an oﬀence has.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/24.h/0209595095wwwiiofindirasee95tml59 9/12/2M. P . SHARMA & ORS V . SA TISH CHANDRA, DISTRICT MAGISTRA TE, DELHI, & ORS [14] INSC 24; AIR 14 SC 30; 14 …been levelled which in the normal' course may result in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons inother situations does not call for decision in this case.Considered in this light the guarantee under article 20(3) would be available in the present cases to thesepetitioners against whom a First Information Report has been recorded as accused therein. It would extend to anycompulsory process for production of evidentiary documents which are reasonably likely to support a prosecutionagainst them. The question then that arises next is whether search warrants for the seizure of such documentsfrom the custody of these persons are unconstitutional and hence illegal on the ground that in eﬀect they aretantamount to compelled production of evidence. It is urged that both search and seizure of a document and acompelled production thereof on notice or summons serve the same purpose of being 1089 available as evidencein a prosecution against the person Concerned, and that any other view would defeat or weaken the Protectionaﬀorded by the guarantee of the fundamental right. This line, of argument is not altogether without force and hasthe apparent support of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in Boyd V. United States(1).The question there which came up for consideration was in fact the converse, namely, whether a compulsoryproduction of documents on the facts of that case amounted to search and seizure. There are dicta in that decisionto the eﬀect that a compulsory production of a man's private papers is a search and seizure since it aﬀects the soleobject thereof and that by this process the court extorts from the party his private books and papers to make himliable for penalty. It is necessary, therefore, to examine this decision rather closely in order to determine how far itcan be a safe guide for our purpose. The question therein arose under the following circumstances. In an Act toamend the, Customs Revenue Laws, there was a provision which enabled the Government Attorney to make awritten motion to the court for the issue of a notice to the opposite-party for production of papers in hispossession.The motion could be made if in the Attorney's opinion those books contain materials which will prove an allegedfact in support of a charge of defrauding the revenues, involving penalty and forfeiture of merchandise to whichthe fraud relates. It is also provided by the said section that if the court in its discretion allows the motion in whichis set out the fact sought to be proved and calls upon the defendant to produce the documents, and the defendantfails or refuses to produce them without any proper and satisfactory explanation, the allegation of fact sought tobe proved by such production may be deemed to have been confessed. The question that thereupon arose waswhether an order for production made by the court under that section did not violate the constitutional rightsdeclared by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the (1) [ 1886] USSC 48; 116 U.S. 616.1090 American Constitution. These amendments are as follows:Amendment IV.""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and eﬀects against unreason. able searchesand seizures, shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath oraﬃrmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. ""Amendment V.""No person......... shall be compelled in any criminal.case, to be a witness against himself;............ "" On the facts of the above case, there was no diﬃculty in holdingthat the production of documents in response to the motion granted by the court was a compelled production ofincriminating evidence and that it violated the Fifth Amendment. The minority judgment brought this out clearlyin the following passage:""The order of the court under the statute is in eﬀect a subpoena duces tecum; and though the penalty for thewitness failure to appear in court with the criminating papers is not ﬁne and imprisonment, it is one which may bemade more severe, namely, to have the charges against him of a criminal nature taken for confessed and made thefoundation of the judgment of the court. That this is within the protection which the Constitution intended againstcompelling a person to be a witness against himself is, I think, quite clear. "" The majority Judges, how ever, wentone step further and said as follows:""The compulsory production of a man's private papers is search and seizure.and again thus "" We have been unable to perceive that the seizure of a man's private books and, papers to be usedin evidence against him is substantially diﬀerent from compelling him to be a witness against himself..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/24.h/0209595095wwwiiofindirasee95tml69 9/12/2M. P . SHARMA & ORS V . SA TISH CHANDRA, DISTRICT MAGISTRA TE, DELHI, & ORS [14] INSC 24; AIR 14 SC 30; 14 …1091 Thus in the view. that the order for production was tantamount to search and seizure and that in the case itwas for a purpose prohibited by the Fifth Amendment, they held that the Fourth Amendment prohibitingunreasonable searches was also violated. The minority Judges, however, did not accept this view and pointed outthat there was an essential diﬀerence between the seizure of a document on search I and the production of adocument. But even otherwise, it would appear on a careful consideration of the decision that the majority were atpains to make out that, in the circumstances of the case the order for production would amount to ""anunreasonable search and seizure"" and is hence unconstitutional as violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.The case, therefore, does not lend support for any general doctrine that a search and' seizure in all circumstancesis tantamount to a compelled production in violation of the Fifth Amendment'. That decision itself expresslyrecognizes the legality of various kinds of searches and indeed the Fourth Amendment itself shows it.Thus what that decision really established was that the obtaining of incriminating evidence by illegal search andseizure is tantamount to the violation of the Fifth Amendment. It was in this light that subsequent cases have alsounderstood this decision. [ See Felix Gouled v. United States(1)].Boyd's case(2) has relied on the famous judgment of Lord Camden in Entick v. Carrington(3), and learned counselfor the petitioners has also relied on it strenuously before us. Wigmore in his Law of Evidence, Vol. VIII, page 368,has shown how some of the assumptions relating to it in Boyd's case(1), were inaccurate and misleading. While nodoubt Lord Camden refers to the principle of protection against self-accusation with great force, in hisconsideration of the validity of general search-warrants, that case does not treat a seizure on a search warrant asipso facto tantamount to self-incrimination. All that was said (1) 253 U.S. 298; 65 Law. Edn. 647 at 651 and 653.(2) [ 1886] USSC 48; 116 U.S. 616.(3) 19 State Trials 1030.1092 was that the legal philosophy underlying both is the same, as appears from the following passage ""It is verycertain, that the law obligeth no man to accuse himself; because the necessary means of compelling self-accusation, falling upon the innocent as well as the guilty, would be both cruel and unjust; and it should seem, thatsearch for evidence is disallowed upon the same principle. There too the innocent would be confounded with theguilty."" It may be noted that Lord Camden's judgment shows, by an elaborate dissertation, that the search warranttherein under consideration was unauthorised and illegal. Thus even the above dictum has reference only to anillegal search.It is, therefore, impossible to derive from Boyd's case(1) support for the proposition that searches and seizures, ingeneral, are violative of the privilege of protection against self-incrimination. Nor is it possible to import thatdoctrine with its diﬀerentiation between legal and illegal searches into our Constitution because we have nothingin our Constitution corresponding to the Fourth Amendment enabling the courts to import the test ofunreasbnableness or any analogous criterion for discrimination between legal and illegal searches.In the arguments before us strong reliance has also been placed on the provision of sections 94 and 96 of theCriminal Procedure Code in support of the broad proposition that a seizure of documents on search is in thecontemplation of law a compelled production of documents.The sections run as follows:"" 94(1). Whenever any court, or in any place beyond the limits of the towns of Calcutta and Bombay, any oﬃcer incharge of a' police-station considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirablefor the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code by or before such court oroﬃcer, such court may issue a summons, or such oﬃcer a written order, to the person in whose possession orpower such document or thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend (1) [ 1886] USSC 48; 116 U.S. 616.1093 and produce it, or to produce it, at the time and place stated in the summons or order.............................."" ""96(1). Where,any Court has reason to believe that a person to whom a summons or orderunder section 94 or a requisition under section 95, subsection (1), has been or might be addressed will not or wouldnot produce the document or thing as required by such summons or requisition, or where such document or thingis not known to the court to be in the possession of any person, or where the court considers that the purposes ofany inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code will be served by a general search or inspection, it may issue.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/24.h/0209595095wwwiiofindirasee95tml79 9/12/2M. P . SHARMA & ORS V . SA TISH CHANDRA, DISTRICT MAGISTRA TE, DELHI, & ORS [14] INSC 24; AIR 14 SC 30; 14 …a search-warrant; and the person to whom such warrant is directed, may search or inspect in accordance therewithand the provisions hereinafter contained..........................."" It is pointed out that the procedure contemplated is that normally there should be a summons ornotice for production under section 94 and it is only if there is no compliance therewith or if the Magistrate issatisﬁed about the likelihood of non-compliance that a search warrant is to be issued. It is, therefore, urged thatthese provisions themselves show that in law search and seizure is a substitute for compelled production onsummons. There has been some debate before us whether section 94 applies to an accused person and whetherthere is any element of compulsion in it. For the purpose of this case it is unnecessary to decide these points. Wemay assume without deciding that the section is applicable to the accused as held by a Full Bench of the CalcuttaHigh Court in a recent case in Satya Kinkar Boy v. Nikhil Chandra Jyotisho- padhaya(1). We may also assume thatthere is an element of complusion implicit in the process contemplated by section 94 because, in any case, nocompliance results in the unpleasant consequence of invasion of one's premises and rummaging of one's (1) A.I.R.1951 Cal 101.1094 private papers by the minions of law under a search warrant.Notwithstanding these assumptions we are unable to read sections 94 and 96(1) of the Criminal Procedure Codeas importing any statutory recognition of a theory that search and seizure of documents is compelled productionthereof.It is to be noticed that section 96(1) has three alternatives and that the requirement of previous notice or summonsand the non-compliance with it or the likelihood of such noncompliance is prescribed only for the ﬁrst alternativeand not for the second or the third. A ""general search"" and a ""search for a document or a thing not known to be inpossession of any particular person"" are not conditioned by any such requirement. Indeed in cases covered by thesecond alternative such a requirement cannot even be contemplated as possible. .It would, therefore, follow, onthe theory propounded, that some at least of the searches within the scope of the second and third alternatives insection 96(1) would fall outside the constitutional protection of article 20(3)-an anomalous distinction for which nojustiﬁcation can be found on principle.A consideration of the history of Indian statutory legislation relating to searches does not support the theorypropounded. The provisions for searches are to be found in the successive Codes of Criminal Procedure. In theearliest Code, Act XXV of 1861, there appears no provision for issuing summons or notices for production ofdocuments, but there was only a provision for the issue of a search warrant by a Magistrate under section 114.thereof, which is in the following terms:""When a Magistrate shall consider that the production of any thing is essential to the conduct of an enquiry into anoﬀence known or suspected to have been committed, he may grant his warrant to search for such thing; and itshall be lawful for the oﬃcer charged with the execution of such warrant to search for such thing in any house orplace within the jurisdiction of such Magistrate. In such case the Magistrate may specify in his warrant the house orplace, or part thereof, to which only the search shall extend.1095 There was also section 142 of the said Code which vested in an oﬃcer in charge of police station with thepower to make a search suo moto in certain circumstances.. In the next Criminal Procedure Code, Act I of 1872, therelevant provisions were in sections 365, 368 and 379. Section 379 was more or less a repetition of section 142 ofthe previous Code (Act XXV -of 1861) vesting power in a police oﬃcer to make a suo moto search. Section 365appears to be the earliest statutory provision for the issue of a summons, either by a police oﬃcer or by a court forthe production of a document required for investigation. This was followed by section 368 relating to the issue ofsearch warrants which was in the following terms:""When a Magistrate considers that the production of anything is essential to the conduct of an inquiry into anoﬀence known or suspected to have been committed or to the discovery of the oﬀender, or when he considersthat such inquiry or discovery will be furthered by the search or inspection of any house or place, he may grant hissearch-warrant; and the oﬃcer charged with the execution of such warrant may search or inspect any house orplace witiin the jurisdiction of the Magistrate of the District.The Magistrate issuing such warrant may, if he sees ﬁt, specify in his warrant the house or place, or part thereof, towhich only the search or inspection shall extend; and the oﬃcer charged with the execution of such warrant shallthen search or inspect only the house, place or part so speciﬁed. "" It will be noticed that even when the procedure.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/24.h/0209595095wwwiiofindirasee95tml89 9/12/2M. P . SHARMA & ORS V . SA TISH CHANDRA, DISTRICT MAGISTRA TE, DELHI, & ORS [14] INSC 24; AIR 14 SC 30; 14 …of summons for production of documents was introduced, as above in section 365 the provision for the issue of asearch- warrant in section 368 had absolutely nothing to do with the question of non-compliance by the concernedperson with the summons for production. It is only in the next. Criminal Procedure Code, Act X of 1882 that theprovisions, sections 94 and 96, appear which correspond to the present sections 94 and 96 of Act V of 1898, linkingup to some extent the issue of 142 1096 search warrants with non-compliance or likelihood of non- compliance.with a summons to produce. It may be mentioned in passing that the provision for the issue of general searchwarrants appears for the ﬁrst time in the Procedure Code of 1882 and even there the issue, of such generalwarrants is not based on noncompliance with a previous summons for production. it is, therefore, clear that thereis no basis in the Indian law for the assumption that a search or seizure of a thing or document is in itself to betreated as compelled production of the same. Indeed a little consideration will show that the two are essentiallydiﬀerent matters for the purpose relevant to the present discussion. A notice to produce is addressed to the party ,concerned and his production in compliance Therewith constitutes a testimonial act by him within the' meaning ofarticle 20(3) as above explained. But search warrant is addressed to an oﬃcer of the Government, generally apolice oﬃcer. Neither the search nor the seizure are 'acts of the occupier of the searched premises. They are actsof another to which he is obliged to submit and are, therefore, not his testimonial acts in any sense. Even in theAmerican decisions there is a strong current of judicial opinion in support of this distinction. In Hale v.Henkel(1), Justice MeKenna in his dissenting judgment makes the following observations:""Search implies a quest by an oﬃcer of the law; a, seizure contemplates a forcible dispossession of theowner............. The quest of an oﬃcer acts upon the things themselves,-may be secret, intrusive, accompanied byforce. The service of a subpoena is but the delivery of, a paper to a party,-is open and aboveboard. There is noelement of trespass or force in it."" A power of search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence'an overridingpower of the State for the protection of social security and that power is necessarily regulated by law. When -theConstitution makers have thougt ﬁt not to subject such regulation to Constitutional limitations by recognition of a(1) [ 1906] USSC 54; 201 U.S. 43; 50 Law. Edn. 652.1097 fundamental right to privacy, analogous to the American Fourth Amendment, we have no justiﬁcation toimport it, into a totally diﬀerent fundamental right. by some process of strained construction. Nor is it legitimateto assume that the constitutional protection under article 20(3) would be defeated by the statutory provisions forsearches. It is to be remembered that searches of the kind we are concerned with are' under the authority of aMagistrate (excepting,in the limited class of cases falling under section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code).Therefore, issue of a search war- rant is normally the judicial function of the Magistrate.When such judicial function is. interposed between the individual and the oﬃcer's authority for search, nocircumvention thereby of the fundamental right is to be assumed. We are not unaware that in the present set up ofthe Magistracy in this country, it is not infrequently that the exercise of this judicial function is liable to seriouserror, as is alleged in the present case. But the existence of scope for such occasional error is no ground to assumecircumvention of the constitutional guarantee.We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the searches with which we are concerned in the present casescannot be challenged as illegal on the ground of violation of any fundamental rights and.that these applicationsare liable to be dismissed.As stated at the outset, we have dealt only with the constitutional issues involved in this case leaving the otherallegations as to the high-handedness and illegality of the searches open to be raised and canvassed before 'theHigh Court on appropriate applications. But we cannot help observing that on those allegations and on thematerial that has come within our notice, there appears to be scope for serious grievance on the side of thepetitioners, which requires scrutiny.We accordingly dismiss these applications but without costs.",

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GHULAM HASAN J.-This appeal ﬁled on a certiﬁcategranted by the High Court of Rajasthan under article 132(1) of the Constitution arises from the judgment and orderof the said High Court (Wanchoo C.J. and Bapna J.) in a petition under article 226 of the Constitution, whereby theHigh Court held that section 8-A inserted in Rajasthan Ordinance No. XXVII of 1948 by section 4 of RajasthanOrdinance No. X of 1949, and the amendment to section 8-A by section 3 of Rajasthan Ordinance XV of 1949 arevoid under article 14 of the Constitution and issued a writ restraining the State of Rajasthan from collecting rentsfrom the tenants of lands comprising the Jagir of Bedla held by the respondent.The respondent Rao Manohar Singhji is the owner of the Jagir of Bedla situate in the former State of Mewar, nowincluded in the State of Rajasthan. The former State of Mewar was integrated in April, 1948, to form what wasg/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/2/95959959rc95www.liiofindia.orasee955.html15 9/12/ 2020THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN V. RAO MANOHAR SINGHJI [14] INSC 25; AIR 14 SC 27; 14 SCR 96 (15 Mah 14)known as the former United State of Rajasthan. In April and May, 1949, the latter State was amalgamated with theformer States of Bikaner, Jaipur, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur and the former Union of Matsya to form the presentUnited State of Rajasthan. Three Ordinances, No. XXVII of 1948 and Nos. X and XV of 1949, were issued by theformer State of Rajasthan in connection with State Jagirs. The management of the Jagirs including the Jagir ofBedla was assumed by the former State of Rajasthan in virtue of the powers under these Ordinances. After theﬁnal formation of the State of Rajasthan in May, 129 998 1949, the Ordinances remained in force in a part of thepresent area of Rajasthan with the result that while jagirs in a part -of the area were managed by the State in thatarea, the Jagirs in the rest of the State were left untouched and remained with the Jagirdars.On 4th January, 1951, the respondent ﬁled a petition under article 226 of the Constitution contending that the saidOrdinances were ultra vires the Constitution and that they became void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution ofIndia, read with articles 14 and 31. The respondent challenged the Ordinances ﬁrstly because they constitute aninfringement of articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution and secondly because the Jagirdars only of the formerState of Rajasthan which was formed in 1948 are prejudicially aﬀected, while Jagirdars of the States whichintegrated later on are not at all aﬀected (Para 9, K and L). It was alleged that there was a denial of equality beforethe law and the equal protection of the laws by reason of these Ordinances and further that the State had takenpossession of the property of the respondent without providing for compensation. The reply of the State was thatthe Jagir was a State grant held at the pleasure of the Ruler and that it reverted to the Ruler on the death of theholder of the Jagir and was regranted to his successor after the Ruler had recognized the succession. The rights ofthe Jagirdars were non-heritable and nontransferable and the Jagirs could not be partitioned amongst the heirs ofthe Jagirdar. It was pleaded therefore that even if the State took possession of the Jagir, the Jagirdar was notentitled to compensation under article 31 (2). It was also alleged that the impugned Ordinances had merely theeﬀect of transferring the management of the Jagirs to the Government and did not deprive the Jagirdars of theirproperty and they were consequently not hit by article 31 (2). It was denied that there was any discriminationunder article 14 of the Constitution. The High Court held on the ﬁrst question that the pro I visions of OrdinancesNos. X and XV of 1949 are not void under article 31 (2) or 19 (1) (f ). On the second point they recorded theconclusion that section 8-A which was introduced in Ordinance No. XXVII of 1948, by section 999 4 of - OrdinanceNo. X of 1949, and the amendment to section 8-A by section 3 of Rajasthan Ordinance No. XV of 1949, are voidunder article 13 (1) of the Constitution, read with article 14. The High Court accordingly, allowed the petition andprohibited the State from collecting rents from the tenants of the land comprising the Jagir of Bedla held by therespondent. This judgment was given on 11th December, 1951, but we understand that since then the State haspassed Acts abolishing Jagirs throughout the State. The question however is of some importance to therespondent inasmuch as it aﬀects his right of collecting the rents even though for a short period.In appeal it is contended by the learned AttorneyGeneral on behalf of the State of Rajasthan that the decision ofthe High Court that the impugned section 8-A as amended was hit by article 14 of the Constitution is erroneous.Before deciding the validity of this contention it will be necessary to refer brieﬂy to the relative provisions of theOrdinances. Ordinance No. I of 1948 (the United State of Rajasthan Administration Ordinance, 1948) was madeand promulgated on April 28, 1948, by the Rajpramukh of Rajasthan to provide for the administration of theUnited State ,of Rajasthan after the latter came into existence.On July 26, 1948, Ordinance No. XXVII of 1948, [ the United State of Rajasthan Jagirdars (Abolition of Powers)Ordinance, 1948] was made and promulgated by the Rajpramukh providing for the abolition of judicial powers ofJagirdars and executive powers in connection with the judiciary and vesting them in the Government. Section 8 ofthis Ordinance authorised the Government to make orders with a view to carrying out and giving eﬀect to theprovisions and pur- poses of the Ordinance and the various powers enumerated in that section. Then came section8-A which was introduced by Ordinance X of 1949 [ the United State of Rajasthan Jagirdars (Abolition of Powers)(Amendment) Ordinance, 1949]. It reads thus:- ""Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions, itis hereby enacted that the revenue which was heretofore collected by Jagirdars shall 1000 henceforward becollected by and paid to the Government; the Government will after deducting the collection and other expensespay. it to the Jagirdar concerned."" It was amended by section 3 of Ordinance No. XV of 1949 [ the United State ofRajasthan Jagirdars (Abolition of Powers) (2nd Amendment) Ordinance, 1949] by adding to section 8-A after theword 'Revenue' the following:"" Including taxes, cesses and other revenue from forests."" It is not denied that when the State of Rajasthan wasformed in April and May, 1949, the Jagirdars of only a part of the present State of Rajasthan could not collect theirrents while Jagirdars in other areas which were covered by Jaipur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur and MatsyaUnion were under no such disability. It appears that in the former State of Rajasthan provisions regarding theg/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/2/95959959rc95www.liiofindia.orasee955.html25 9/12/ 2020THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN V. RAO MANOHAR SINGHJI [14] INSC 25; AIR 14 SC 27; 14 SCR 96 (15 Mah 14)management by Government of Jagirs and the right to collect rents already existed, whereas there was no suchprovision in the former States of Jaipur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur and Matsya Union, but when theintegration took place in April and May, 1949, the discrimination exhibited itself not by virtue of anything inherentin the impugned Ordinances but by reason of the fact that Jagirdars of one part of the present State of Rajasthanwere already subjected to a disability in the matter of management of their Jagirs while the other parts werewholly unaﬀected. This discrimination, however undesirable, was not open to any exception until the Constitutioncame into force on January 26, 1950, when article 13 of the Constitution declared that ""all laws in force in theterritory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistentwith the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void."" It becomes therefore necessaryto see whether the impugned provision which is discriminatory on the face of it is hit by article 14 which declaresthat ""the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within theterritory of India.,"" Such an obvious discrimination 1001 can be supported only on the ground that it was basedupon,,,& reasonable classiﬁcation. It is now well settled by the decision of this court that a proper classiﬁcationmust always bear a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect of which it is proposed. Judged by thiscriterion it seems to us that the discrimination is based on no classiﬁcation at all and is manifestly unreasonableand arbitrary. The classiﬁcation might have been justiﬁed if the State had shown that it was based upon asubstantial distinction, namely that the Jagirdars of the area subjected to the disability were in some way diﬀerentto those of the other area of Rajasthan who were not similarly situated. It was perfectly possible for the State tohave raised a speciﬁc ground in order to get out of the mischief of article 14, that the discrimination was basedupon-what the learned Attorney-General called geographical consideration, that the Jagirs of the particular areawere governed by diﬀerent laws of tenure and thus constituted a class by itself and that that was a good groundfor diﬀerentiation.No such ground was ever put forward before the High Court, much less was any attempt made to substantiatesuch a ground. In the absence of any allegation supported by evidence we are unabe to ﬁnd in favour of the Statethat the Jagirdars of the particular area to which category the respondent belongs were diﬀerently situated toother Jagirdars.The preambles of the Ordinances do not purport to show that the conditions in the former State of Rajasthan weresuch as to justify the imposition of the disability on the Jagirdars of that State while the conditions prevailing in theother States forbade such a course. The High Court held that the Ordinance abolishing the Police and the Judicialpowers and the administrative powers of the Jagirdars in respect to revenue in -forests was open to no objectionbut there was no reason for taking away from the Jagirdars by section 8-A the power to collect rents to which theywere entitled.We agree with the High Court in holding that there was no real and substantial distinction why the Jagirdars of aparticular area should continue to be 1002 treated with inequality as compared with the Jagirdars in another areaof Rajasthan. We hold therefore that no rational basis for any classiﬁcation or diﬀerentiation has been made out.Section 8-A of the impugned Ordinance as amended is a clear contravention of the respondent's right under article14 of the Constitution and must be declared void.The case of Frank J. Bowman v. Edward A. Lewis(1) relied upon by the learned Attorney-General on behalf of theState is inapplicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. By the Constitution and laws of Missourithe citizens residing in one hundred and nine counties of the State of Missouri had the right and privilege of anunrestricted appeal to the supreme Court of the State, while, at the same time the right of appeal -was denied tothe citizens of the State residing in four of the counties in the easterly portion of the State, as also to thoseresiding in the City of St. Louis. It was contended that this feature of the judicial system of Missouri was in conﬂictwith the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Bradley J. held that the equality clause in the14th Amendment contemplates the protection of persons against unjust discriminations by a State; it has noreference to territorial or municipal arrangements made for diﬀerent portions of a State. He went on to say:-"" If aMexican State should be acquired by treaty and added to an adjoining State or part of a State, in the UnitedStates, and the two should be erected into.a new State, it cannot be doubted that such new State might allow theMexican 1aws and judicature to continue unchanged in the one portion, and the common law and itscorresponding judicature in the other portion. Such an arrangement would not be prohibited by any fairconstruction of the 14th Amendment. It would not be based on any respect of persons or classes, but on municipalconsiderations alone, and a regard to the welfare of all classes within the particular territory or jurisdiction."" Thispassage which was strongly relied upon by the learned Attorney-General does not advance his case (1) 1O1 U.S 22;[ 1879] USSC 103; 25 Law. Ed. 989.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/2/95959959rc95www.liiofindia.orasee955.html35 9/12/ 2020THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN V. RAO MANOHAR SINGHJI [14] INSC 25; AIR 14 SC 27; 14 SCR 96 (15 Mah 14)1003 for in the present cage there is no question of continuing unchanged @the old laws and judicature in oneportion and a diﬀerent law in the other. As we have already said there is nothing to show that there as anypeculiarity or any special feature in the Jagirs of the former State of Rajasthan to justify diﬀerentiation from theJagirs comprised in the States which subsequently integrated into the present United State of Rajasthan. After thenew State was formed, there was no occasion to take away the powers of Jagirdars of a disfavoured area and toleave them intact in the rest of the area.The case in Ramjilal v. Income-tax Oﬃcer, Mohindargarh (1) is distinguishable on the ground that that caseproceeded upon the principle that ""pending proceedings should be concluded according to the law applicable atthe time when the rights or liabilities accrued and the proceeding commenced was a reasonable law founded upona reasonable classiﬁcation of the assessees which is permissible under the equal protection clause. "" Such ishowever not the case here.Reliance was also placed on the case of The State of Punjab v. Ajaib Singh and Another(1). In that case theAbducted Persons (Recovery and Restoration) Act of 1949 was not held to be unconstitutional under article 14upon the ground that it extended only to the several States mentioned in section 1(2), for in the opinion of thecourt classiﬁcation could well be made on a geographical basis.There the Muslim abducted persons- found in those States were held to form one class having similar interests toprotect and their inclusion in the deﬁnition of abducted persons could not be called discriminatory.;The learned Attorney-General referred to two cases decided by the same. Bench of the Rajasthan High Court,Thakur Madan Singh v. Collector of Sikar(3), and an unreported judgment delivered on November 10, 1953, In re,Raja Hari Singh v. Rajasthan and argued (1) (1951] S.C.R. 127.(2) [ 1952] INSC 57; [ 1953] S.C.R. 254.(3) Rajasthan Law Weekly, 1954, P.1.1004 that the Bench -had not stuck to its view expressed in the judgment under appeal. A careful, perusal of thejudgments in these cases will show that this is far from being the case. The former case was distinguished from thecase under appeal on the ground that there was a reasonable basis for classiﬁcation in that case, while no suchbasis existed in the case before us. It appears that before Jaipur State merged into the present United State ofRajasthan there were District Boards existing in that State. They were continued on the formation of the newState but there were no District Boards in the other States. The argument that the Jaipur District Boards Act wasinvalid under article 14 of the Constitution was repelled it being held that the existence of District Boards in Jaipurwas for the welfare of all classes within Jaipur that Jaipur had reached a higher stage of development than many ofthe other States and it would have been a retrograde step to deprive the People living in the former Jaipur State ofthe beneﬁts -of Local Self Government conferred by the District Boards Act. Reliance was placed on theobservations of Bradley J. in Frank J.Bowman v. Edward A. Lewis(1) in connection with the illustration of the Mexican State and* the learned ChiefJustice referred with approval to the decision under appeal before us. In the second case the attack was on thealleged discriminatory provision contained in the Mewar Tenancy Act and the Land Revenue Act. Under these Actsthe rent rates had been approved by the Board of Revenue and the Government and they were alleged to bedetrimental to the interests of the Jagirdars. The Jagirdars had challenged those Acts by a petition under article226. It appears that no such laws existed in the other parts of Rajasthan. The decision of the High Court proceededon the ground that it was not shown that there were no similar tenancy and Land Revenue laws in other parts ofRajasthan and the impugned Acts being ameliorative legislation designed to raise the economic status of theagriculturists in Mewar could not be said to constitute any discrimination merely because no such legislation (1)[ 1879] USSC 103; 101 U.S. 22 ; 25 Law. Ed. 989.1005 existed in the other parts of Rajasthan . This diﬀerence between the two parts did not justify that suchprogressive and ameliorative measures for the welfare of the people existing in a particular area should be done,away with and the State be brought down to the level of the unprogressive States. The judgment shows that theBench far from going back on its previous view adhered to it and expressly distinguished the case under appealbefore us on its special facts. .As a result of the foregoing discussion we hold that the view taken by the High Court is correct. We accordinglydismiss the, appeal with costs.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/2/95959959rc95www.liiofindia.orasee955.html45 9/12/ 2020THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN V.

J.-This is an appeal by leave from ajudgment of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur dated the 25th of April, 1952, dismissing a petition underarticle 226 of the Constitution of India ﬁled by the appellant questioning the vires of certain provisions of theCentral Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act 1947.The appellant represents a concern C. Parakh and Company (India) Limited, a company registered under' theIndian Companies Act, 1913, having its head oﬃce at Bombay, and several branches in . the State of MadhyaPradesh. The main business of the appellant company is that of cotton. The head-oﬃce of the appellant atBombay sells cotton bales to several mills and individuals under the control and the system regulated by theTextile Commissioner at Bombay, and upon a contract of sale being completed the goods after being ginned andpressed are sent from Khamgaon and other places in the State of Madhya Pradesh and are actually delivered inBombay and such other places outside the State of Madhya Pradesh as directed by the head oﬃce. The cottonbales are sent by rail under an insurance in favour of the appellant, and are delivered to the buyer by tender ofrailway receipt against the payment of price in Bombay.Under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act I XXI of 1947), cotton was declared liable to salestax on the 11th of April, 1949, and since that date the appellant commenced paying the tax in respect of thepurchases made by it, and continued to pay it till the 31st of December, 1950. For the quarter ending on the 31stofMarch, 1951, the appellant declined to pay the tax in respect of the purchases made during that quarter, realizingthat it could not be made legally liable for the payment of this tax in the State of Madhya, Pradesh, thetransactions done or eﬀected in Madhya Pradesh not being "" sales"" within that State. Apprehending that thecompany 1124 may be subjected to the payment of the tax without authority of law, an application was preferredin the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur praying for an appropriate writ or writs which may secure to thecompany protection from the impugned Act and its enforcement by the State. It was alleged that Explanation II tosection 2(g) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, as further amended by Act XVI of 1949 wasultra vires and illegal.This petition, along with a refer eence in another case (Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 258 of 1951: A.I.R. 1952 Nag.378), was heard by a Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court and it was held that Explanation II to section 2(g) ofthe Act was not enforceable because under the Constitution sales tax could only be collected, in the State wherethe goods were delivered for consumption. It was further held that Explanation 11 as amended by the C.P. & BerarAct XVI of 1949 was not validly enacted because it made drastic changes in the rules of the Sale of Goods Act.Without obtaining the assent of the Governor-General as required by section 107 of the Government of India Act,1935. 'It was observed that the mere p reduction of the goods in a State is not enough to make the tax payableunless the goods are appropriated to a particular contract, and that to impose the tax at that stage would betantamount to charging an excise duty and not a tax on the sale of goods. In spite of these ﬁndings the High Courtdeclined to issue a writ and dismissed. the petition made to it under article 226 of the Constitution on the groundthat a mandamus issues only to compel an authority to do or abstain from doing some act, that it is seldomanticipatory and certainly never issues where the action of the authority is dependant on some action of thepetitioner and that in the present case the petitioner had not even made his return and no demand for the taxcould be made from him.In this appeal it was argued, by Shri Noshirwan Engineer, learned counsel for the appellant, that an illegal andunjust imposition operates as an illegal restraint on trade and violates fundamental rights, 1125 that the HighCourt having held that the Constitution by article 286 thereof made delivery of the goods for consumption thedecisive factor for determining which State should have the right of taxing such sales, and having thus found theprovision of the Explanation to the deﬁnition of ""sale"" unconstitutional, should have issued a writ of mandamusrestraining the respondent State from enforcing that part of the Act.To appreciate the contentions of the learned counsel it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the Actwhich, the High Court has declared ultra vires the State Legislature. Act XXI of 1947 deﬁnes the expression ""sale"" insection 2(g) of the Act in these terms:- "" 'Sale' with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions meansany transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payments or other valuable consideration including transferof property in goods made in the course of the execution of a contract, but does not include a mortgage,hypothecation, charge or pledge "".www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/26.html/0209595095129524 9/12/2HIMMATLAL HARILAL MEHTAV V. THE ST ATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS [14] INSC 26; AIR 14 SC 43; 14 SCR 1…"" Explanation.(I)-"" A transfer of goods on hirepurchase or other instalment system of payment shall,notwithstanding that the seller retains a title to any goods as security for payment of the price, be deemed to be asale. "" Explanation (II)-"" Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the sale ofany goods which are actually in the Central Provinces and Berar at the time when the contract of sale as deﬁned inthat Act in respect thereof is made, shall, wherever the said contract of sale is made, be deemed for the purpose ofthis Act to have taken place in the Central Provinces and Berar. "" This provision was amended by the CentralProvinces and Berar Act XVI of 1949 which came into force on the 11th of ApriL 1949, by which Explanation II ofsection 2(g) was amended as follows:- Explanation (II)-,' Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the IndianSale of Goods Act, 1930, the sale or purchase of any goods shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act, to havetaken place in this 1126 Province-wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made (a) If the goodswere actually in this Province at the time when the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made, or (b)In case, the contract was for the sale or purchase of future goods by description, then, if the goods are actuallyproduced or found in this Province at any time after the contract of sale or purchase in respect 'thereof was made."" Certain amendments were made in the Act, by Act IV of 1951 which came into force on the 1st of April. 1951, butthese are not relevant to the present' inquiry.As pointed out above, the High Court held that the new Explanation II was ultra vires the State Legislature andthat the mere production of goods was not enough to make the tax payable unless the goods were appropriatedto a particular contract. The correctness of this view can no longer be questioned by reason of the majoritydecision of this court in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd.(1), wherein it was held that article286(1) (a) of the Constitution read with the Explanation thereto and construed in the light of article 301 and article304 prohibits the taxation of sales or purchases involving inter-State elements, by all States except the State inwhich the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein and that the view that the Explanation doesnot deprive the State, in which the property in the goods passed, of its taxing power and that consequently boththe State in which the property in the goods passes and the State i n which the goods are delivered forconsumption have the power to tax, is not correct.The learned Advocate-General of the State did not in this situation, and very properly, challenge the correctness ofthe decision of the High Court on this point, and conceded that the Explanation was clearly ultra vires the StateLegislature. He however contended that on the principle enunciated by the Privy (1) [ 1953] INSC 24; [ 1953] S.C.R.1069.1127 Council in Raleigh Investment Co. v. The Governor- General in Council(1), jurisdiction to question assessmentotherwise than by use of the machinery expressly provided by the Act, was inconsistent with the statutoryobligation to pay, arising by virtue of the assessment and that the liability to pay the sales tax under the Act is aspecial liability created by the Act itself which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy which oughtto be resorted to, and therefore the remedy by a writ ought not to be allowed to be used for evading the provisionsof the Act, especially a ﬁscal Act. It was also said that the con- ditions requisite for the issue of a writ of mandamuswere not present in the case and that it was not within the scope and purpose of article 226 of the Constitution todecide an academic question.In our opinion, the contentions raised by the learned Advocate-General are not well founded. It is plain that theState evinced an intention that it could certainly proceed to apply the penal provisions of the Act against theappellant if it failed to make the return or to meet the demand and in order to escape from such seriousconsequences threatened without authority of law, and infringing fundamental rights, relief by way of a writ ofmandamus was clearly the appropriate relief. In Mohd. Yasin v. The Town Area Committee(2), it was held by thiscourt that a licence fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a,restriction on his fundamental right to carry on his business and therefore if the imposition of a licence fee iswithout authority of law it can be challenged by way of an application under article 32, a fortiori also, under article226. These observations have apposite application to the circumstances of the present case.

Moreover, the remedyprovided by the Act is of an onerous and burdensome character. Before the appellant can avail of it he has todeposit the whole amount of the tax. Such a provision can hardly be described as an adequate alternative remedy.For the reasons given above, we are of the opinion that the High Court, having held that the Explanation II tosection 2(g) of the Act was ultra vires, was in error in dismissing the application on the ground that it was notentitled to relief under the provisions of article 226 of the Constitution.

"" As we have alreadystated the appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain was made on October 9, 1950, i.e., after the Industrial DisputesAct had become applicable to Rajasthan.It is not necessary therefore to invoke the provisions of Ordinance.IV of 1950 in deciding the question of thevalidity of the appointment. The argument based on section 34 of Act XLVIII of 1950 was put forward before theHigh Court at the time of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and it was contended that in view ofsection 34 the provisions of Rajasthan Adaptation of Central Laws Ordinance, 1950, namely section 5, subsections(vii) and (ix), stood amended or repealed but the High Court observed that even if this argument had been raisedbefore them in appeal, it would have made no diﬀerence. It has been contended before us by Mr. Hajela, thelearned Advocate- General on behalf of the State, that after the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 was extended toRajasthan by section 34 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, XLVIII of 1950, the provisions of theformer stood amended by section 34 and could not be read subject to section 5 of the Rajasthan Adaptation ofCentral Laws Ordinance IV of 1950.We think there is force in this contention. The eﬀect of section 34, as we have already indicated, was to extend theterritorial application of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, to the whole of India including Rajasthan the exceptionbeing the State of Jammu and Kashmir only. This being so the words ""A Judge of a High Court and a District Judge""used in section 7(3) (a) and (b) respectively of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, must be held now to include ""AJudge of the High Court and a District Judge in the former State of Jodhpur"". There is now no room for theapplication of section 5 of Ordinance IV of 1950 according to which a Judge of the High Court 1133 and a DistrictJudge could only. mean a Judge of the High Court for Rajasthan established under the Rajasthan High CourtOrdinance 1949 and a District Judge of or in Rajasthan within the meaning of section 5(ix) of Ordinance No. IV of1950. Accordingly we hold that the appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain was perfectly valid.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 29.html/02095959959523 9/12/2THE STA TE OF RAJASTHAN V.

The Industrial Actwas applied to Rajasthan by the Rajasthan Adaptation of Central Laws Ordinance, 1950 (Ordinance IV of 1950), bythe Rajpramukh on January 24, 1950. By this adaptation section 7 of the Industrial Act came to be applied toRajasthan. Shri Sukhdeo Narain was appointed on October 9, 1950, by a notiﬁcation which ran as follows:- ""Inexercise of the powers conferred by section 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.(XIV. of 1947) the Government ofRajasthan is pleased to constitute an Industrial Tribunal consisting of Shri Sukhdeo Narain, a retired Judge of theHigh Court of the erstwhile Jodhpur State for the adjudication of an Industrial dispute in the Mewar Textile MillsLtd., Bhilwara, in Rajasthan. "" The appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain was objected to by the respondent on theground that, the 1131 words ""a Judge of a High Court"" in section 7(3) mean "" a Judge of the High Court ofJudicature for Rajasthan established under the Rajasthan High Court Ordinance, 1949"" and as Shri Sukhdeo Narainhad been a Judge of the High Court of the former State of Jodhpur, he could not be held to be Judge of the HighCourt under section 7(3) of the Industrial Act. This objection was upheld by the High Court.Though the appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain in the notiﬁcation was based upon the fact that he was a retiredJudge of the High Court of Jodhpur, in arguments it was also contended before the High Court that even if he wasnot qualiﬁed for appointment as a former Judge of a High Court, he was certainly qualiﬁed for appointment as aformer District Judge. The High Court repelled this contention.It appears that the United State of Rajasthan came into existence on April 7, 1949, and the United State of Matsyawas integrated with it on May 15, 1949. Section 5 of Ordinance No. IV of 1950 lays down that:"" For the purpose of the application of any Central law to Rajasthan, unless there be anything repugnant in thesuject or context,- (ix) references therein to other civil, criminal and revenue courts, to public oﬃces, and toJudges, Magistrates, oﬃcers or authorities shall be deemed to be references to such courts, oﬃces and Judges,Magistrates, oﬃcers or authorities of or in Rajasthan. "" The High Court held that the word ""Rajasthan"" as deﬁnedin Ordinance I of 1949 means the United State of Rajasthan and ""the Judges an d other oﬃcers"" mentioned insection 5(ix) must be held to be those in the service of the United State of Rajasthan. Accordingly they held thatShri Sukhdeo Narain could not be held to be a District Judge within the meaning of section 7(3) (b) and hisappointment as an Industrial Tribunal under that section was, therefore, invalid. We are of opinion that this appealcan be decided on a short ground. The Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act (XLVIII of 1950) came into forceon May 20, 1950. By section 34 it was provided that the 1132 Industrial Disputes Act, XIV of 1947, shall be amendedin the manner speciﬁed in the Schedule and the Schedule substituted sub-section (2) to section (1) of the IndustrialAct as follows"

THE STATE OF MADRAS & ORS [1954] INSC 30; AIR 1954 SC 397; 1954 SCR 1229 (18 March 1954).pdf,"Held that an appeal is competent to the Supreme Court under s. 476B of the Code of Criminal Procedure from anorder of a Division Bench of a High Court directing the ﬁling of a complaint for perjury.Also held that the simultaneous prosecution of civil and criminal proceedings regarding the same matter is likelyto embarrass the accused and so ordinarily, and in the absence of special circumstances, the criminal proceedingsshould be given precedence and the civil proceedings should be stayed pending the termination of the criminal.","- ""Any person against whom a complaint has been made"" [ under section 476] ""may appeal to the court towhich such former court is subordinate within the meaning of section 195 (3)......"" The latter section reads- ""For thepurpose of this section, a court shall be deemed to be subordinate to the court to which appeals ordinarily lie fromthe appealable decrees or sentences of such former court........"" The rest of the section does not concern us.Two things are evident. First, that a right of appeal has been expressly conferred by section 476B provided there isa higher forum to which an appeal can be made; and second that the appellate forum has been designated in anartiﬁcial way. The appeal lies to the court to which the former court is subordinate within the meaning of section195 (3). But ""sub. ordinate"" does not bear its ordinary meaning. It is used as a term of art and has been given aspecial meaning by reason of the deﬁnition in section 195 (3): a ﬁction has been imposed by the use of the word""deemed""., We have accordingly next to examine the content of the ﬁction.1147 The section says that the court making the order under section 476 shall be deemed to be subordinate to thecourt (a) to which appeals ordinarily lie (b) from the appelable decrees or sentences of such former court.Now the former court in this case is a Division Bench of the High Court. The only court to which an appealordinarily lies from the appealable decrees and sentences of a Division Bench of a High Court is this court.Therefore, a Division Bench of a High court is a court ""subordinate"" to this court within the meaning of section 195(3); accordingly an appeal lies to this court from an order of a Division Bench under section 476..It was contended that there is no ordinary right of appeal to this court and that such rights as there are thoseexpressly conferred by the Constitution in a very limited and circumscribed set of circumstances, therefore, suchappeals as lie to this court cannot be said to lie ""ordinarily"".We do not agree. Such an argument concentrates attention on the word ""ordinarily"" and ignored the words""appealable decrees or sentences"". Before we can apply the deﬁnition we have ﬁrst to see whether there is a classof decrees or sentences in the court under consideration which are;at all open to appeal. If there are not, thematter- ends and there is no right of appeal under section 476.B. If there are, then we have to see to which courtthose appeals will ""ordinarily"" lie. It is evident that the only court to which the appealable decrees and sentences ofa Division Bench of a High Court can lie is the Supreme Court. There is no other court to which an appeal can bemade. It follows that is the ordinary course in the case of all appealable decrees and sentences and thatconsequently this is the court to which such appeals will ordinarily lie.As there is a right of appeal we have next to consider the matter on its merits and there the only relevantconsideration is whether ""it is expedient in the interests of justice"" that an enquiry should be 1148 made and a,complaint ﬁled. That involves a careful balancing of many factors.The High Court has scrutinised the. evidence minutely and has disclosed ample material on which a judicial mindcould reasonably reach the conclusion that there is matter here which requires investigation in a criminal court andthat it is expedient in the interests of justice to have it enquired into. We have not examined the evidence for.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/30.h/020959599522rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml23 9/12/2M. S. SHERIFF V . THE ST ATE OF MADRAS & ORS [14] INSC 30; AIR 14 SC 37; 14 SCR 19 ( 18 Mah 14)ourselves and we express no opinion on the merits of the respective cases but after a careful reading of thejudgment, of the High Court and the report of the District Judge we can ﬁnd no reason for interfering with the HighCourt's discretion on that score. We do not intend to say more than this about the merits as we are anxious not toprejudge or prejudice the case of either side. The learned Judges of the High Court have also very -rightly observedin their order under section 476 that they were not expressing any opinion on the guilt or innocence of theappellants.We were informed at the hearing that two further sets of proceedings arising out of the same facts are now,pending against the appellants. One is two civil suits for damages for wrongful conﬁnement. The other,is twocriminal prosecutions under section 344, Indian Penal Code, for wrongful conﬁnement, one against each Sub-Inspector. It was said that the simultaneous prosecution of these, matters will embarrass the accused. But after thehearing of the appeal we received information that the two criminal prosecutions have been closed with liberty toﬁle fresh complaints when the papers are ready, as the High Court records were not available on the application ofthe accused As these prosecutions are not pending at the moment, the objection regarding them does not arisebut we can see that the simultaneous prosecution of the present criminal proceedings out of which this appealarises and the civil suits will embarrass the accused. We have therefore to determine which should be stayed.As between the civil and the criminal proceedings we are of the opinion that the criminal matters should 1149 begiven precedence. There is some diﬀerence of opinion in the High Courts of India on this point. No hard and fastrule ban. be laid down but we do not consider that the possibility of conﬂicting decisions in the civil and criminalcourts is a relevant consideration. The law envisages such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from makingthe decision of one court binding on the other, or even relevant, except for certain limited purposes, such assentence or damages. The only relevant consideration here is the likelihood of embarrassment.Another factor which weighs with us is that a civil suit often drags on for years and it is undesirable that a criminalprosecution should wait till everybody concerned has forgotten all about the crime. The public interests demandthat criminal justice should be swift and sure; that the guilty should be punished while the events are still fresh inthe public mind and that the innocent should be absolved as early as is consistent with a fair and impartial trial.Another reason is that it is undesirable to let things glide till memories have grown too dim to trust.This,however, is not a hard and fast rule. Special considerations obtaining in any particular case might make someother course more expedient and just. For example, the civil case or the other criminal proceeding may be so hearits end as to make it inexpedient to stay it in order to give precedence to a prosecution order of under section 476.But in this case we are of the view that the civil suits should be stayed till the criminal proceedings have ﬁnished.The result is that the appeal fails and is dismissed but with no order about costs. Civil Suits Nos. 311 of 1951 to 314of 1951, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Coimbatore, will be stayed till the conclusion of the prosecutionunder section 193, Indian Penal Code.

Both the Sub Inspectors said that the petitioners were not in their custody. The ﬁrst Sub-Inspector, who wasconcerned with Govindan, said that Govindan had never been arrested by him and had not been in his custody at.any time. The other denied that Damodaran was in his custody. He admitted that he had arrested him at one timebut said that he had been released long before the petition. Each swore an aﬃdavit in support of his return.

The petitioners were however regularly arrestedafter their petitions and before the High Court's order; one was released on bail and the other was remanded to jailcustody by an order of a Magistrate. Accordingly their petitions became infructuous and were dismissed.After this, the petitioners applied to the High Court under section 476 of the Criminal Procedure Code and 1146asked that the Sub-InsPectors be prosecuted for perjury under section 193, Indian Penal Code. The applicationswere granted and the Deputy Registrar of the High Court was directed to make the necessary complaints.The Sub-Inspeetors thereupon asked for leave to appeal to this court. Leave was refused on the ground that noappeal lies, but leave was granted under article 132 as an interpretation of articles 134 (1) and 372 of theConstitution was involved. The Sub Inspectors have appealed here against that order as also against the orderunder section 476. In addition, as an added precaution, they have ﬁled a petition for special leave to appeal underarticle 136 (1).The ﬁrst question we have to decide is whether there is a right. of appeal.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.-These two connected appeals aredirected against a common judgment of a division Bench of the Bombay High Court, dated the 12th of September,1952, by which the learned Judges dismissed two petitions under article 226 of the Constitution presentedrespectively by the appellants in the two appeals.1057 The petitioners in both the cases assailed the consti- tutional validity of the Act, known as the Bombay PublicTrusts Act, 1950 (Act XXIX of 1950), which was passed by the Bombay Legislature with a view to regulate and makebetter provisions for the administration of the public and religious trusts in the State of Bombay. By a notiﬁcation,dated the 30th of January, 1951, the Act was brought into force on and from the 1st of March, 1951, and itsprovisions were made applicable to temples, maths and all other trusts, express or constructive, for either a public,religious or charitable purpose or both. The State of Bombay ﬁgures as the ﬁrst respondent in both the appealsand the second respondent is the Charity Commissioner, appointed by the ﬁrst respondent under section 3 of theimpugned Act to carry out the provisions of the Act throughout the State of Bombay. In one of the appeals,namely, Appeal No. 1 of 1954, the Assistant Charity Commissioner for the region of Baroda has been impleaded asthe third respondent.The appellant in Appeal No. I of 1954 is a Swetamber Murtipujak Jain and a resident of Vejalpar in the district ofPunchmahals within the State of Bombay. He is a Vahivatdar or manager of a Jain public temple or Derasarsituated in the same village and the endowed properties appertaining to the temple are said to be of the value ofRs. 5 lakhs. The petition, out of which this appeal arises, was ﬁled by the appellant on the 29th of May, 1952,before the High Court of Bombay, in its Appellate Side, against the three respondents mentioned above, prayingfor the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus or direction ordering and directing the respondents to forbearfrom enforcing or taking any steps for the enforcement of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950,,or of any of itsprovisions and parti- cularly the provisions relating to registration of public and religious trusts managed by theappellant and payment of contributions levied in respect the same. The grounds urged in support of the petitionwere that a number of provisions of the Act convicted with the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteedunder articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution and that the 1058 contribution levied on the trust was a tax which itwas beyond the competence of the State Legislature to impose.A similar application under article 226 of the Consti- tution and Praying for almost the identical relief was ﬁled bythe appellants, in the other appeal, namely, Appeal No. 7 of 1954 before the High Court in its Original Side on the4th of August, 1952. The petitioners in this case purport to be the present trustees of the Parsi Punchayet Fundsand Properties in Bombay registered under the Parsi Public Trusts Registration Act of 1936. These propertiesconstitute one consolidated fund and they are administered by the trustees for the beneﬁt of the entire Parsicommunity and the income is spent for speciﬁed religious and charitable purposes of a public character asindicated by the various donors. The petitioners, challenged the validity of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950,substantially on the grounds that they interfered with the freedom of conscience of the petitioners and with theirwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395210 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V.

The levy ofcontribution under section 58 of the Act was also alleged in substance and eﬀect to be a tax on public, religiousand charitable trusts, a legislation upon which it was beyond the competency of the State Legislature to enact.As practically the same questions were involved in both the petitions, the learned Chief Justice of Bombay directedthe transfer of the later petition from the Original Side to the Appellate Side of the High Court and both of themwere heard together by a Division Bench consisting of the Chief Justice himself and Shah J. Both the petitionswere disposed of by one and the same judgment delivered on the 12th of September, 1952, and the learned Judgesrejected all the contentions put forward on behalf of the respective applicants and dismissed the petitions. Thepetitioners in both the cases have now come before us in appeal on the strength of certiﬁcates granted 1059 bythe High Court under article 132(1) of the Constitution.To appreciate the points that have been canvassed before us by the parties to these appeals, it may be convenientto refer brieﬂy to the scheme and salient features of the impugned Act.The object of the Act, as stated in the preamble, is to regulate and make better provisions for the administration ofpublic, religious and charitable trusts within the State of Bombay. It includes, within its scope, all public trustscreated not merely for religious but for purely charitable purposes as well and extends to people of all classes anddenominations in the State. The power of superintendence and administration of public trusts is vested, under theAct, in the Charity Commissioner, who is to be appointed by the State Government in the manner laid down inChapter II.The State Government may also appoint such number of Deputy and Assistant Charity Commissioners as. it thinksﬁt and these oﬃcers would be placed in charge of particular regions or particular trusts or classes of trusts as maybe considered necessary. Section 9, with which Chapter III of the Act beigins, deﬁnes what 'charitable purposes'are, and sections 10 and 11 lay down that a public trust shall not be void on the ground of uncertainty, nor shall itfail so far as a religious and charitable purpose is concerned, even if a non-charitable or non-religious purpose,-which is includ- ed in it,. cannot be given eﬀect to. Chapter IV provides for registration of public trusts. Section 18makes it obligatory upon the trustee of every public trust to which the Act applies, to make an application for theregistration of the trust, of which he is the trustee. In case of omission on the part of a trustee to comply with thisprovision, he is debarred under section 31 of the Act from instituting a suit to enforce any right on behalf of suchtrust in a court of law. Chapter V deals with accounts and audit. Section 32 imposes a duty upon every trustee of apublic trust, which has been registered under the Act, to keep regular accounts. Under section 33, these accountsare to be audited annually, in such manner as may be prescribed.1060 Section 34 proscribes it to be the duty of the auditor to prepare balance-sheets and to report all irregularitiesin the accounts. Section 35 lays down how trust money has to be invested, and section 36 prohibits alienation ofimmovable trust property except by way of leases for speciﬁed periods, Without the previous sanction of theCharity Commissioner. Section 37 authorises the Charity Commissioner and his subordinate oﬃcers to enter onand inspect or cause to be entered on and inspected any property belonging to a public trust. A proviso is added tothe section laying down that in entering upon any such property, the oﬃcers making the entry shall givereasonable notice to the trustee and shall have due regard to the religious practices and usages of the trust.Among other powers and functions of the Charity Commissioner, which are detailed in Chapter VII, section 44enables a Charity Commissioner to be appointed to act as a trustee of a public trust by a court of competentjurisdiction or by the author of the trust. Section 47 deals with the powers of the court to appoint new trustee ortrustees and under clause (3) of this section, the court, after making enquiry, may appoint the CharityCommissioner or any other person as a trustee to ﬁll up the vacancy. Section 48 provides for the levy ofadministrative charges in cases where the Charity Commissioner is appointed a trustee. Section 50 appears to be asubstitute for section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code and contains provisions of almost the same character inrespect to suits regarding public trusts. One of the reliefs that can be claimed in such a suit is a declaration as towhat proportion of the trust property or interest therein shall be allocated to any particular object of the trust.Section 55 purports to lay down the rule of cy pres in relation to the administration of religious and charitabletrusts; but it extends that doctrine much further than is warranted by the principles laid down by the ChanceryCourts in England or recognised by judicial pronouncements in this country. Section 56 deals with the powers ofthe courts in relation to the application of -the cy pres doctrine. Section 57 provides for the establishment of a fundto be called ""The 1061 Public Trusts Administration Fund which shall vest in the Charity Commissioner and clause(2) lays down what sums shall be credited to this fund. Section 58 makes it obligatory on every public trust to payto this fund a contribution at such time and in such manner as may be Prescribed. Under the, rules prescribed bywww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395310 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V. THE ST A TE OF BOMBAY & ORS [14] INSC 31; AIR 14 SC 38; 14 SCR 15 (18 Marc…the Government on this subject, the contribution has been ﬁxed at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum upon thegross annual income of every public trust. Failure .to pay this contribution will make the trustee liable to thepenalties provided for in section 66 of the Act. Section 60 provides that the Public Trusts Administration Fundshall, subject to the provisions of the Act and subject to the general and special orders of the State Government,be applicable to the. payment of charges for expenses incidental to the regulation of public trusts and generally forcarrying out the provisions of the Act. Sections 62 to 66, which are comprised in Chapter IX of the Act, deal withthe appointment and qualiﬁcations of assessors. The function of the assessors is to assist and advise the CharityCommissioner or his subordinate oﬃcers in the matter of making enquiries which may be necessary under theprovisions of the Act. Chapter X prescribes the penalties that will be inﬂicted on trustees in case of their violatingany of the pro visions of the Act. Chapter XI deals with procedural matters in connection with jurisdiction of courtsand rights of appeal, and the twelfth or the last chapter deals with certain miscellaneous matters. These, in brief,are the provisions of the Act which are material for our present purpose.The contentions that have been raised by the learned counsel, who appeared in support of the appeals, may beconsidered under two heads. In the ﬁrst place, a number of provisions of the Act have been challenged as invalidon the ground that they conﬂict with freedom of religion and the right of the religious denominations or sects,represented by the appellants in each case, to manage their own, aﬀairs in matter of religion guaranteed underarticles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. The sections of the Act, the validity of which has been challenged on thisground are sections 18, 31 to 37, 44, 1062 47, 48 50, clauses (e) and (g), 55, 58 and 66. The second head of theappellants argument relates to the levy of contribution as laid down in sections 57 and 58 of the Act and theargument is that this being in substance the levy of a tax, it was beyond the competence of the State Legislatureto enact-such a provision.As regards the ﬁrst branch of the contention, a good deal of argument has been advanced before us relating to themeasure and extent of the fundamental rights guaranteed under articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. It will benecessary to address ourselves to this question at the outset, because without a clear appreciation of the scopeand am bit of the fundamental rights embodied in the two articles of the Constitution, it would not -be possible todecide whether there has been a transgression of these rights by any of the provisions of the Act. This identicalquestion came up for consideration before this court in Civil Appeal No. 38 of 1953 (The commissioner, HinduReligious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Tirtha Swamiar(1) and it was discussed at some length in ourjudgment in that case. It will be suﬃcient for our present purpose to refer succinctly to the main principles that thiscourt enunciated in that judgment.Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees to every person and not merely to the citizens of India the freedom ofconscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion. This is subject, in every case, to publicorder, health and morality. Further exceptions are engrafted upon this right by clause (2) of the article.Sub-clause (a) of clause (2) saves the power of the State to make laws regulating or restricting any economicﬁnancial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice; and sub-clause (b)reserves the State's power to make laws providing for social reform and social welfare even though they mightinterfere with-religious practices. Thus, subject to the restrictions which this article imposes, every person has afundamental right under our Constitution not merely to entertain such religious belief as may be approved of byhis judgment or conscience but to exhibit his belief and ideas in such (1) [ 1954] INSC 46; [ 1954] S.C.R. 1005.1063 overt acts as are enjoined or sanctioned by his religion and further to propagate his religious views for theediﬁcation of others. It is immaterial also whether the propagation is made by a person in his individual capacity oron behalf of any church or institution. The free exercise of religion by which is meant the performance of outwardacts in pursuance of religious belief, is, as stated above, subject to State regulation imposed to secure order, publichealth and morals of the people. What sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of article 25 contemplates is not State regulationof the religious practices as such which are protected unless they run counter to public health or morality but ofactivities which are really of an economic, commercial or political character though they are associated withreligious practices.So far as article 26 is concerned, it deals with a particular aspect of the subject of religious freedom.Under this article, any religious denomination or a section of it has the guaranteed right to establish and maintaininstitutions for religious and charitable purposes and to manage in its own way all aﬀairs in matters of religion.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395410 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V. THE ST A TE OF BOMBAY & ORS [14] INSC 31; AIR 14 SC 38; 14 SCR 15 (18 Marc…Rights are also given to such denomination or a section of it to acquire and own movable and immovableproperties and to administer such properties in accordance with law. The language of the two clauses (b) and (d) ofarticle 26 would at once bring out the diﬀerence between the two. In regard to aﬀairs in matters of religion, theright of management given to a religious body is a guaranteed fundamental right which no legislation can takeaway. On the other hand, as regards administration of property which a religious denomination is entitled to ownand acquire, it has undoubtedly the right to administer such property but only in accordance with law. This meansthat the State can regulate the administration of trust properties by means of laws validly enacted but here againit should be remembered that under article 26 (d), it is the religious denomination itself which has been given theright to administer its pro- perty in accordance with any law which the State may validly impose. A law, whichtakes away the right of 138 1064 administration altogether from the religious denomination and vests it in anyother or secular authority, would amount to violation of the right which is guaranteed by article 26 (d) of theConstitution.The moot point for consideration, therefore, is where is the line to be drawn between what are matters of religionand what are not ? Our Constitution-makers have made no attempt to deﬁne what 'religion' is and it is certainlynot possible to frame an exhaustive deﬁnition of the word 'religion' which would be applicable to all classes ofpersons. As has been indicated in the Madras case referred to above, the deﬁnition of religion given by Fields J. inthe American case of Davis v. Beason(1), does not seem to us adequate or precise. ""The term 'religion""', thusobserved the learned Judge in the case mentioned above, ""has refer- ence to one's views of his relations to hisCreator and to the obligations they impose of reverence for His Being and character and of obedience to His Will. Itis often confounded with cultus or form of worship of a particular sect, but is distinguishable from the latter"". itmay be noted that 'religion' is not necessarily theistic and in fact there are well known religions in India likeBuddhism and Jainism which do nor believe in the existence of God or of any Intelligent First Cause. A religionundoubtedly has its basis in a system of beliefs -and doctrines which are regarded by those who profess thatreligion to be conducive to their spiritual well being, but it would not be correct to say, as seems to have beensuggested by one of the learned Judges of the Bombay High Court, that matters of religion are nothing butmatters of religious faith and religious belief. A religion is not merely an opinion, doctrine or belief. It has itsoutward expression in acts as well. We may quote in this connection the observations of Latham C. J. of the HighCourt of Australia in the case of Adelaide Company v. The Commonwealth(2), where the extent of protectiongiven to religious freedom by section 116 of the Australian Constitution came up for consideration.(1)133 U.S. 33 (2) [ 1943] HCA 12; 67 C.L.R, 116, 124.1065 ""It is sometimes suggested in discussions on the subject of freedom of religion. that, though the civilGovernment should not interfere with religious opinions, it nevertheless may deal as it pleases with any acts whichare done in pursuance of religious belief without infringing the principle of freedom of religion. It appears to me tobe diﬃcult to maintain this distinction as relevant to the interpretation of section 116. The section refers in expressterms to the exercise of religion, and therefore it is intended to protect from the operation of any Commonwealthlaws acts which are done in the exercise of religion. Thus the section goes far beyond protecting liberty of opinion.It protects also acts done in pursuance of religious belief as part of religion., In our opinion, as we have already saidin the Madras case, these observations apply fully to the provision regarding religious freedom that is embodied inour Constitution.Religious practices or performances of acts, in pursuance of religious belief are as much apart of religion as faith orbelief in particular doctrines. Thus if the tenets of the Jain or the Parsi religion lay down that certain rites andceremonies are to be performed at certain times and in a particular manner, it cannot be said that these are secularactivities partaking of commercial or economic character simply because the involve expenditure of money oremployment of priests or the use of marketable commodities. No outside authority has any right to say that theseare not essential parts of religion and it. is not open to the secular authority of the State to restrict or prohibit themin any manner they like under the guise of administering the trust estate. Of course, the scale of expenses to, beincurred in connection with these religious observances may be and is a matter of administration of propertybelonging to religious institutions; and if the expenses on these heads are likely to deplete the endowed propertiesor aﬀect the stability of the institution,, proper control can certainly be exercised by State agencies as the lawprovides. We may refer in this connection to the observation of 1066 Davar J. in the case of Jamshedji v.Soonabai(1), and although they were made in a case where the question was whether the bequest of property by aParsi testator for the purpose of perpetual celebration of ceremonies like Muktad baj, Vyezashni, etc., which aresanctioned by the Zoroastrian religion were valid charitable gifts, the observations, we think, are quite appropriatefor our present purpose. ""If this is the belief of the community"" thus observed the learned Judge, ""and it is provedwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395510 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V. THE ST A TE OF BOMBAY & ORS [14] INSC 31; AIR 14 SC 38; 14 SCR 15 (18 Marc…undoubtedly to be the belief of the Zoroastrian community,-a secular Judge is bound to accept that belief-it is notfor him to sit in judument on that belief, he has no right to interfere with the conscience of a donor who makes agift in favour of what he believes to be the advancement of his religion and the ,Welfare of his community ormankind"".These observations do, in our opinion, aﬀord an indication of the measure of protection that is given by article26(b) of our Constitution.The distinction between matters of religion and those of secular administration of religious properties may, attimes, appear to be a thin one. But in cases of doubt, as Chief Justice Latham pointed out in the case(2) referred toabove, the court should take a common sense view and be actuated by considerations of practical necessity. It is inthe light of these principles that we will proceed to examine the diﬀerent provisions of the Bombay Public TrustsAct, the validity of which has been challenged on behalf of the appellants.We will ﬁrst turn to the provisions of the Act which relate to registration of trusts. Under section 18, it is incumbenton the trustee of every public, religious or charitable trust to get the same registered. Section 66 of the Act makesit an oﬀence for a trustee not to comply with this provision and prescribes punishment for such oﬀence.Section 31 provides for further compulsion by laying down that no suit shall lie on behalf of a public trust toenforce its right in any court of law unless the trust is registered. A compulsory payment (1) 33 Bom. I22.(2) Vide Adelaide Company v. The commonwealth, 67 C.L.R.116, i29.1067 of a fee of Rs. 25 has also been prescribed by the rules framed by the Government for registration of a trust.The provisions of registration undoubtedly have been made with a view to ensure-due supervision of the trustproperties and the exercise of proper control over them. These are matters relating to administration of trustproperty as contemplated by article 26(d) of the Constitution and cannot, by any stretch of imagination be held tobe an attempt at interference with the rights of religious institutions to manage their religious aﬀairs. The feesleviable under section 18 are credited to the Public Trust Administration Fund constituted under section 57 and areto be spent for meeting the charges incurred in the regulation of public trusts and for carrying into eﬀect theprovisions of the Act. The penalties provided are mere consequential provisions and involve no infraction of anyfundamental right. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that according to the tenets of theJain religion the property of the temple and its income exist for one purpose only, viz., the religious purpose, and adirection to spend money for purposes other than those which are considered sacred in the Jain scriptures wouldconstitute interference with the freedom of religion. This contention does not appear to us to be sound. Theseexpenses are incidental to proper management and administration of the trust estate like payment of municipalrates and taxes, etc., and cannot amount to diversion of trust property for purposes other than those which areprescribed by any religion.The next group of sections to which objections have been taken comprises sections 32 to 37. Section 32 compels atrustee of a public trust to keep accounts in such form as may be prescribed by the Charity Commissioner. Section33 provides for the auditing of such accounts and section 34 makes it the duty of the auditor to prepare balance-sheets and to report irregularities, if any, that are found in the accounts. These are certainly not matters of religionand the objection raised with regard to the validity of these provisions seem to be altogether baseless Section 35relates to investment of money belonging to trusts. It is a well 1068 settled principle of law that trustees in chargeof trust properties should not keep cash money in their hands which are not necessary for immediate expenses;and a list of approved securities upon which trust money could be invested is invariably laid down in everylegislation on the subject of trust. There is nothing wrong in section 36 of the Act.Immovable trust properties are inalienable by their very nature and a provision that they could be alienated onlywith the previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner seems to us to be a perfectly salutary provision.Section 37 has been objected to on the ground that an unrestricted right of entry in any religious premises mightoﬀend the sentiments of the followers of that religion; but the section has expressly provided that the oﬃcersmaking the entry shall give reasonable notice of their intended entry to the trustees and shall have due regard tothe religious practice and usages of the trust. Objection has next been taken to sections 44 and 47 of the Act.Section 44 lays down that the Charity Commissioner can be appointed to act as trustee of a public trust by a courtwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395610 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V. THE ST A TE OF BOMBAY & ORS [14] INSC 31; AIR 14 SC 38; 14 SCR 15 (18 Marc…of competent jurisdiction or by the author of the trust. If the author of the trust chooses to appoint the CharityCommissioner a trustee, no objection can possibly be taken to such action;but if the court is authorised to make such appointment, the provisions of this section in the general form as itstands appear to us to be open to serious objection. If we take for example the case of a religious institution like aMath at the head of which stands the Mathadhipati or spiritual superior. The Mathadhipati is a trustee according tothe provisions of the.Act and if the court is competent to appoint the Charity Commissioner as a superior of aMath,.the result would be disastrous and it would amount to a ﬂagrant violation of the constitutional guarantee whichreligions institutions have under the@ Constitution in regard to the management of its religious aﬀairs. This is nota secular aﬀair at all relating to the administration of the trust property. The very object of a Math is to maintain acompetent line of religious teachers for propagating and strengthening the religious 1069 doctrines of a particularorder or sect and as there could be no Math without a Mathadhipati as its spiritual head, the substitution of theCharity Commissioner for the superior would mean a destruction of the institution altogether. The evil is furtheraggravated by the provision of clause (4) of the section which says that the Charity Commissioner shall be the soletrustee and it shall not be lawful to appoint him as a truste along with other persons. In our opinion, the provisionof section 44 relating to the appointment of the Charity Commissioner as a trustee of any public trust by the courtwithout any reservation in regard to religious institutions like temples and Maths is unconstitutional and must beheld to be void. The very same objections will apply to the provisions of clauses (3) to (6) of section 47.The court can certainly be empowered to appoint a trustee to ﬁll up a vacancy caused by any of the reasonsmentioned in section 47(1), and it is quite a -salutary principle that in making the appointment the court shouldhave regard to matters speciﬁed in clause (4) of section 47 ; but the provision of clause (3) to the extent that itauthorises the court to appoint .the Charity Commissioner as the trustee- and who according to the provisions ofclause (5) is to be the sole trustee-cannot be regarded as valid in regard to religious institutions of the type wehave just indicated.To allow the Charity Commissioner to function as the Shebait of a temple or the superior of a Math would certainlyamount to interference with the religious aﬀairs of this institution. We hold accordingly that the provisions ofclauses (3) to (6) of section 47 to the extent that they relate to the appointment of the Charity Commissioner as atrustee of a religious trust like temple and Math, are invalid. If these provisions of section 47 are eliminated, noobjection can be taken to the provision of section 48 as it stands. This section will in that event be conﬁned only tocases where the Charity Commissioner has been appointed a trustee by the author of the trust himself and theadministrative charges provided by this section can certainly be levied on the trust.1070 We now come to section 50 and exception has been taken to clauses (e) and (g) of that section. It is diﬃcult tosee how these provisions can at all be objected to. Section 50, as has been said above, is really a substitute forsection 92 of the Civil Procedure Code and relates to suits in connection with public trusts Clause (e) of section 50 isan exact reproduction of clause (e) of section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code and clause (g) also reproducessubstantially the provision of clause (g) of section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code. There is no question of infractionof any fundamental right by reason of these provisions.A more serious objection has been taken by the learned counsel for the appellants to the provisions of sections 55and 56 of the impugned Act and it appears to us that the objections are to a great extent well founded. Thesesections purport to lay down how the doctrine of cy pres is to be applied in regard to the administration of publictrust of a religious or charitable character. The doctrine of cy pres as developed by the Equity Courts in England,has been adopted by out Indian courts since a long -time past.The provisions of sections 55 and 56, however, have extended the doctrine much beyond its recognised limits andhave further ,introduced certain principles which run counter to well established rules of law regarding theadministration of charitable trusts. When the particular purpose for which a charitable trust is created fails or byreason of certain circumstances the trust cannot be carried into eﬀect either in whole or in part, or where there is asurplus left after exhausting the purposes speciﬁed by the settlor, the court would not, when there is a generalcharitable intention expressed by the settlor, allow the trust to fail but would execute it cy pres, that is to say, insome way as nearly as possible to that which the author of the trust intended. In such cases, it cannot be disputedthat the court can frame a scheme and give suitable directions regarding the objects upon which the trust moneycan be spent. It is we 11 established, however, that where the donors intention can be given eﬀect to, the court hasno authority to sanction any deviation from the intentions expressed 1071 by the settlor on the grounds ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395710 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V. THE ST A TE OF BOMBAY & ORS [14] INSC 31; AIR 14 SC 38; 14 SCR 15 (18 Marc…expediency and the court cannot exercise the power of applying the trust property or its income to other purposessimply because it considers them to be more expedient or more beneﬁcial than what the settlor had directed(1).But this is exactly what has been done by the provision of section 55(c) read with section 56 of the Act. Theseprovisions allow a diversion of property belonging to a public trust or the income thereof to objects other thanthose intended by the donors if the Charity Commissioner is of opinion, and the court conﬁrms its opinion anddecides, that carrying out wholly or partially the original intentions of the author of the trust or the object forwhich the trust was created is not wholly or partially expedient, practicable, desirable or necessary;and that the property or income of the public trust or any portion thereof should be applied to any other charitableor religious object. Whether a provision like this is reasonable or not is not pertinent to our enquiry and we mayassume that the legislature, which is competent to legislate on the subject of charitable and religious trust, is atliberty to make any provision which may not be in consonance with the existing law; but the question before us is,whether such provision invades any fundamental right guaranteed by our Constitution, and we have no hesitationin holding that it does so in the case of religious trusts. A religious sect or denomination has the undoubted rightguaranteed by the Constitution to manage its own aﬀairs in matters of religion and this includes the right to spendthe trust property or its income for the religious purposes and objects indicated by the founder of the trust orestablished by usage obtaining in a particular institution. To divert the trust property or funds for purposes whichthe Charity Commissioner or the court considers expedient or proper, although the original objects of the foundercan still be carried out, is to our minds an unwarrantable encroachment on the freedom of religious institutions inregard to the management of their religious aﬀairs. It is perfectly true, as has been stated (1) Vide Halsbury, 2ndEdn., VOl. IV, P. 228, 139 1072 by the learned counsel for the appellants, that it is an established maxim of the Jainreligion that Divadraya or religious property cannot be diverted to purposes other than those which are consideredsacred in the Jain scriptures.But apart from the tenets of the Jain religion, we consider it to be a violation of the freedom of religion and of theright which a religious denomination has under our Constitution to manage its own aﬀairs in matters of religion, toallow any secular authority- to divert the trust money for purposes other than those for which the trust wascreated. The State can step in only when the trust fails or is incapable of being carried out either in whole or inpart. We hold, therefore, that clause (3) of section 55, which contains the oﬀending provision and thecorresponding provision relating to the powers of the court occurring in the latter part of section 56(1), must be,held to be void.The only other section of the Act to which objection has been taken is section 58 and it deals with the levy ofcontribution upon each public trust, at certain rates to be ﬁxed by the rules, in proportion to the gross annualincome of such trust. This together with the other sums speciﬁed in clause (2) of section 57 makes up the PublicTrusts Administration Fund, which is to be applied for payment of charges incidental to the regulation of publictrusts and for carrying into eﬀect the provisions of this Act. As this contribution is levied purely for purposes of dueadministration of the trust property and for defraying the expenses incurred in connection with the same, noobjection could be taken to the provision of the section on the ground of its infringing any fundamental rights ofthe appellants.The substantial, contention that has been raised in regard to the validity of this provision comes, however, underthe second head of the appellants' arguments indicated above.The contention is that the contribution which is made payable under this section is in substance a tax and theBombay State Legislature was not competent to enact such provision within the limits of the authority exercisableby it under the Constitution. This raises a point of some importance which requires to be examined carefully.1073 It is not disputed before us that if the contribution that is levied under section 58 is a tax, a legislationregarding it would be beyond the competence of the State Legislature. Entries 46 to 62 of List II in Schedule VII ofthe Constitution specify the diﬀerent kinds of taxes and duties in regard to which the State Legislature isempowered to legislate and a tax of the particular type that we have here is not covered by any one of them. Itdoes not come also under any speciﬁc entry in List III or even of List I.The position, therefore, is that if the imposition is held to be a tax, it could come either under entry 97 of List I,which includes taxes not mentioned in Lists II and III or under article 248 (1) of the Constitution and in either case itis Parliament alone that has the competency to legislate upon the subject. If, on the other hand, the impositioncould be regarded as ""fees"", it can be brought under entry 47 of the Concurrent List, the Act itself being alegislation under entries 10 and 28 of that List. The whole controversy thus centers round a point as to whether thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395810 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V. THE ST A TE OF BOMBAY & ORS [14] INSC 31; AIR 14 SC 38; 14 SCR 15 (18 Marc…contribution leviable under section 50 is a fee or tax and what in fact are the indicia and characteristics of a feewhich distinguish it from a tax. This identical question came up for consideration before this court in Civil AppealNo. 38 of 1953 referred to above, in, connection with the provision of section 76 of the Madras Religious andCharitable Endowments Act, and the view which we have taken in that case regarding the proper criterion fordetermining whether an imposition is a fee or tax is in substantial agreement with the view taken by the BombayHigh Court in the present case.. As the matter has been discussed at some length in the Madras case, it will not benecessary to repeat the same discussions 'over again. It will be enough if we indicate the salient principles thatwere enunciated by this court in its judgment in the Madras case mentioned above.We may start by saying that although there is no generic diﬀerence between a tax and a fee and in fact they areonly diﬀerent forms in which the taxing power of a State manifests itself, our Constitution has, in fact, made adistinction between a tax and a fee for, 1074 legislative purposes. While there are various entries in the threelegislative lists with regard to various forms of taxation, there is an entry at the end of each one of these lists asregards fees' which could be levied in respect of every one of the matters that are included therein .This distinctionis further evidenced by the provisions of the Constitution relating to Money Bills which areembodied in articles 110and 199. Both these articles provide that a bill should not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason only that itprovides for the imposition of ﬁnes or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered,whereas a bill relating to imposition, abolition or regulation of a tax would always be recckoned as a Money Bill.There is no doubt that a fee resembles a tax in many respects and the question which presents diﬃculty is, what isthe proper test by which the one could be distinguished from the other? A tax is undoubtedly in the nature of acompulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes, the payment of which is enforced by law.But the other and equally important characteristic of a tax is, that the imposition is made for public purpose tomeet the general expenses of the State without reference to any special advantage to be conferred upon thepayers of the tax. It follows, therefore, that although a tax may be levied upon particular classes of persons orparticular kinds of property, it is imposed not to confer any special beneﬁt upon individual -persons and thecollections are all merged in the general revenue of the State to be applied for general public purposes. Tax is acommon burden and the only return which the taxpayer gets is participation in the common beneﬁts of the State.Feees on the other hand, are payments primarily in the public interest, but for some special service rendered orsome special work done for the beneﬁt of those from whom the payments are demanded. Thus in fees there isalways an element of quid pro quo which is absent in a tax. It may not be possible to prove in every case that thefees that are collected by the Government approximate to the expenses that are incurred by it in rendering anyparticular kind of services or in 1075 performing any particular work for the beneﬁt of certain individuals. But inorder that the collections made by the Government can rank as fees, there must be co-relation between the levyimposed and the expenses incurred by the State for the purpose of rendering such services. This can be proved byshowing that on the face of the legislative provision itself, the collections are not merged in the general revenuebut are set apart and appropriated for rendering these services. Thus two elements are essential in order that apayment may be regarded as a fee. In the ﬁrst place, it must be levied in consideration of certain services whichthe individuals accepted either willingly or unwillingly and in the second place, the amount collected must be ear-marked to meet the expenses of rendering these services and must not go to the general revenue of the State tobe spent for general public purposes. As has been pointed out in the Madras case mentioned above, too muchstress should not be laid on the presence or absence of what has been called the Coercive element. It is not correctto say that as distinguished from taxation which is compuslory payment, the payment of fees is always voluntary,it being a matter of choice with individuals either to accept the service or not for which fees are to be paid. We maycite for example the case of a licence fee for a motor car. It is argued that this would be a fee and not a tax, as it isoptional with a person either to own a motor car or not and in case be does not choose to have a motor car, heneed not pay any fees at all. But the same argument can be applied in the case of a house tax or land tax. Suchtaxes are levied only on those people who own lands or houses and it could be said with equal propriety that a manneed not own any house or land and in that event he could avoid the payment of these taxes. In the second place,even if the payment of a motor licence fee is a voluntary payment, it can still be regarded as a tax if the fees thatare realised on motor licences have no relation to the expenses that the Government incurs in keeping an oﬃce orbureau for the granting of licences and the collections are not appropriated for that purpose but 1076 go to thegeneral revenue. Judging by this test, it appears to us that the High Court was perfectly right in holding that thecontributions imposed under section 58 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act are really feEs and not taxes. In the ﬁrstplace, the contributions, which are collected under section 58, are to be credited to the Public TrustsAdministration Fund as constituted under section 57. This is a special fund which is to be applied exclusively forpayment of charges for expenses incidental to the regulation of public trusts and for carrying into eﬀect theprovisions of the Act. It vests in the Charity Commissioner and the custody and investments of the moneYwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 31.html/02095958950395910 9/12/2RA TILAL P ANA CHAND GANDHI V.

The collections,therefore, are not merged in the general revenue, but they axe earmarked and set apart for this particular purpose.it is true that under section 6A of the Act, the oﬃcers and servants appointed under the Act are to draw their payand allowances from the Consolidated Fund of the State but we agree with what has been said by Mr. Justice Shahof the Bombay High Court that this provision is made only for the purpose of facilitating the administration andnot with a view to mix up the fund with the general revenue, collected for Government purposes.This would be clear from the provision of section 6B which provides that out of. the Public Trusts AdministrationFund all the costs, which the State Government may determine on account of pay, pension, leave and otherallowances of all.the oﬃcers appointed under this Act, shall ' be paid. It is the Public Trusts Administration Fund, therefore, whichmeets all the expenses of the administration of trust property within the scheme of the Act, and it is to meet theexpenses of this administration that these collections are levied. As has been said by the learned Judges of theHigh Court, according to the concept of a modern State, it is -not necessary that services should be rendered onlyat the request of particular people, it is enough that payments are demanded for 1077 rendering services which theState considers beneﬁcial in the public interests and which the people have to accept whether they are willing ornot. Our conclusion, therefore, is that section 58 is not ultra vires of the State Legislature by reason of the fact thatit is not a tax but a fee which comes within the purview of entry 47 of List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution.The result, therefore, is that in our opinion the appeals are allowed only in part and a mandamus will issue in eachof these cases restraining the State Government and the Charity Commissioner from enforcing against theappellants the following provisions of the Act to wit"

Mr. Basu, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, contends that his client was, in fact, prosecutedfor these identical oﬀences before the Commissioner appointed under Act XXXVII.of 1850. This, it is argued, was not a mere departmental enquiry of the type referred to in Maqbool Hussain'scase(1). The Commissioner was a judicial tribunal in the proper sense of the expression. He had to adjudicate onthe charges judicially, on evidence, recorded on oath, which he was authorised by law to administer. Theprosecution was conducted by a prosecutor appointed under the Act, charges were read out to the accused personand his plea was taken;witnesses on both sides were examined on oath and they were cross-examined and re-examined. TheCommissioner had all the powers of a court; he could summon witnesses, compel production of relevantdocuments and punish people for contempt. At the close of the enquiry, the Commissioner did record his ﬁndingagainst the petitioner on some of the charges. He had undoubtedly no power to impose any punishment and hadonly to forward his report to the Government. Under section 22 of the Act, however, the Government was entitled.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/34.h/020959579515rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml37 9/12/2S.A. VENKA TARAMAN V. THE UNION OF INDIA & ANR [14] INSC 34; AIR 14 SC 35; 14 SCR 10 (30 Mah 14)to pass such orders within its authority, as it considered proper and in exercise of this authority the President didimpose upon the petitioner the penalty of dismissal.(1) [ 1953] S.C. R. 7o3.1156 It is immaterial, it is argued, for the purPose of article 20(2) of the.constitution that the -prosecution wasbefore one authority and punishment was inﬂicted by another. The petitioner was both prosecuted and punishedand he is sought to be prosecuted on the same chages over again. This constitutes, according to the learnedcounsel, a clear violation of the guarantee implied in article 20(2) of the constitution. The questions raised areundoubetdly of some importance and require to be carefully exaimined.It is true that the Commissioner appointed to make an enquiry under Act XXXVII of 1850 is invested with some ofthe powers of a court, particularly in the matter of summoning witnesses and compelling the production ofdocuments and the report, which he has to make has to be made on legal evidence adduced under sanction ofoath and tested by cross-examination. But from these facts alone the conclusion does not necessarily follow thatan enquiry made and concluded under Act XXXVII of 1850 amounts to prosecution and punishment for an oﬀenceas contemplated.by article 20(2) of the Constitution. In order to arrive at a proper decision on this point, it is necessary to examinethe entire background-of the provisions relating to enquiry into the conduct of public servants and to ascertain theexact scope and purpose of the enquiry as is contemplated by Act XXXVII of 1850 and the ultimate result that ﬂowsfrom it.It is a well established principle of English law that, except where it is otherwise provided by a statute, all publicoﬃcers and servants of the Crown hold their appointments at the pleasure of the Crown. Their services can beterminated without assigning any reason and even if any public servant considers that he has been unjustlydismissed, his remedy is not by way of a law suit but by an appeal of an oﬃcial or political character(1). Thisprinciple of law was applied in lndia ever since the advent of British rule in this country and the servants in theemploy, of the East India Company also came within the purview of this (1) Vide Shenton v. Smith [ 1895) A.C. 229.1157 rule. It is to be remembered that it was during the period of the East India Company that the Public Servants(Inquiries) Act was passed in 1850. The object of the Act, as stated in the preamble, was to regulate enquiry intothe behaviour of public servants, not removal from service without the sanction of the Government. The enquirywas quite optional with the Government and did not aﬀect in any way the powers of the Government to dismiss itsservants at pleasure and this was expressly provided by section 25 of the Act, the wording of which is as follows:"" Nothing in this Act shall be construed to aﬀect the authority of the Government to. suspending or removing anypublic servant for any cause without an enquiry under the Act. "" After assumption of the Government of India bythe Crown, this rule of English common law continued unaltered till 1919 when section 96B was introduced by theamended Government of India Act of that year. Sub-section (1) of section 96B of the Government- of India Act,1919, runs as follows:"" Subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder, every person in the civil service of the Crownin India holds oﬃce during His Majesty's pleasure and may be employed in any manner required by a properauthority within the scope of his duty, but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinateto that by which he was appointed ....................."" Thus one restriction imposed by this section upon the unfetteredright of the Government to dismiss its servants at its pleasure, was that no servant could be dismissed by anyauthority subordinate to that by which he was appointed.The section by its opening words also makes the exercise of the power subject to the rules made under the Act andit was in pursuance of the provision of section 96-B(2) that the Civil Service (Classiﬁcation, Control and Appeal)Rules were framed which with the later amendments are in force even now. Part XII of these rules deal withConduct and ] Discipline of Civil Servants and rule 49 of this part lays down that the diﬀerent penalties provided,1l58 by the diﬀerent clauses of the rule may, for good and suﬃcient reasons, be imposed upon members of theservices comprised in clauses (1) to (5) in rule 14. These penalties include, amongst others, censure, withholding ofincrement, dismissal, reduction in rank and removal. Rule 55, which ﬁnds a place in the same chapter, lays downthe procedure to be followed before passing an order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank against anymember of the service. No such order shall be passed unless the person concerned has been informed,, in writing,of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action against him and has been aﬀorded an adequate opportunity.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/34.h/020959579515rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml47 9/12/2S.A. VENKA TARAMAN V. THE UNION OF INDIA & ANR [14] INSC 34; AIR 14 SC 35; 14 SCR 10 (30 Mah 14)of defending himself. An enquiry has to be made regarding his conduct and this may be done either in accordancewith. the provisions of the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act of 1850 or in a less formal and less public manner as isprovided for in the rule itself.These rules have no statutory force and it was held by the Privy Council that when an oﬃcer was dismissed fromservice without complying with the provisions of these rules, he had no right of action against: the Crown(1). Inother words, the rules, which were not incorporated in a statute, did not impose any legal restriction upon theright of the Crown to dismiss its servants at pleasure.The position was altered to some extent in the Government of India Act, 1935, and in addition to the restrictionimposed by section 96-B(1) of the Government of India Act, 1919, that a civil servant could not be dismissed by anauthority subordinate to that by which he was appointed, a further statutory provision was made(2), that a civilservant could not be dismissed or reduced in rank unless the person concerned was given a reasonable opportunityof showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him. Article 311(2) of the present Constitutionhas further added the word "" removal "" after "" dismissal "" and (1) Vide Vankata Rao v. The Secretary of State forIndia, 64 I.A. 55.(2) Vide section 240(3) Of the Government of India Act, 1935.1159 before reduction in rank "" and thus in all the three cases which are covered by rule 55 of the Civil ServicesRules, a civil servant has now a constitutional right to claim a - reasonable opportunity of showing cause againstthe action proposed to be taken in regard to him.As the law stands at present, the only purpose, for which an enquiry under Act XXXVII of 1850 could be made, is tohelp the Government to come to a deﬁnite conclusion regarding the misbehaviour of a public servant and thusenable it to determine provisionary the punishment which should be imposed upon him prior to giving him areasonable opportunity of showing cause, as is required under article 311(2) of the Constitution. An enquiry underthis Act is not at all compulsory and it is quite open to the Government to adopt any other method if it so chooses.It is a matter of convenience merely and nothing else. It is against this background that we will have to examinethe material provisions of the Public Servants (Inquiries),Act of 1850 and see whether from the. nature and resultof the enquiry which the Act contemplates it is at all possible to say that the proceedings taken or concluded underthe Act amount to prosecution and punishment for a criminal oﬀence.It may be pointed out that the words ""prosecution"" and ""punishment"" have no ﬁxed connotation and they, aresusceptible of both a wider and a narrower meaning; but in article 20(2) both these words have been used withreference to an ""oﬀence"" and the word ""oﬀence"" has to be taken in the sense in which it is used in the GeneralClauses Act as meaning I an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force."" It follows thatthe prosecution must be in reference to, the law which creates the oﬀence and the punishment must also be inaccordance with what that law prescribed The acts alleged to have been committed by, the petitioner in thepresent case and on the basis of which the charges have been framed against him do come within the deﬁnition of""oﬀences"" described in sections 161 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code and 150 1160 section 5(2) of the Preventionof Corruption Act. The Public Servants (Inquiries) Act does not itself create any oﬀence nor does it provide any,punishment for it. Rule 49 of the Civil Services Rules mentioned above merely speaks of imposing certain penaltiesupon public servants for good and suﬃcient reasons. The rule does not mention any particular oﬀence andobviously can create none. It is to enable the Government to come to the conclusion as to whether good andsuﬃcient reasons exist, within the meaning of rule 49 of the Civil Services Rules, for imposing the penalties ofremoval, dismissal or reduction in rank upon a public servant that an enquiry may be directed under Act XXXVII of1850. A Commissioner appointed under this Act has no duty to investigate any oﬀence which is punishable underthe Indian Penal. Code or the Prevention of Corruption Act and he has absolutely no jurisdiction to do so. Thesubject-matter of investigation by him is the truth or otherwise of the imputation of misbehaviour made against apublic servant and it is only as instances of misbehaviour that the several articles of charge are investigated, uponwhich disciplinary action might be taken by the Government if it so chooses. The mere fact that the word-""prosecution"" has been used, would not make the proceeding before the Commissioner one for prosecution of anoﬀence. As the Commissioner has to form his opinion upon legal evidence, he has been given the power tosummon witnesses, administer oath to then and also to compel production of relevant documents. These, may besome of the trappings of a judicial tribunal, but they cannot make the proceeding any- thing more than a mere factﬁnding enquiry. This is concluisively established by the provisions of section 21 and 22 of the Act. At the close ofthe enquiry, the Commissioner has to submit a report to the Government regarding his ﬁnding on each one of thecharges made: This is a mere expression of opinion and it lacks both ﬁnality and authoritativeness which are ,he.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/34.h/020959579515rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml57 9/12/2S.A. VENKA TARAMAN V. THE UNION OF INDIA & ANR [14] INSC 34; AIR 14 SC 35; 14 SCR 10 (30 Mah 14)essential tests of a judicial pronouncement. The )pinion is not even binding on the Government Under section 22of the Act, the Government can, after 1161 receipt of the report, call upon the Commissioner to take, furtherevidence or give further explanation of his opinion. When Special Commissioners are appointed, their report couldbe referred to the court or other authority to which the oﬃcer concerned is subordinate for further advice andafter taking -the opinion of the diﬀerent authorities and persons, the Government has to decide ﬁnally what actionit should take.Then again neither section 21 nor section 22 of the Act says anything about punishrment. There is no to expressany power in the Commissioner even opinion about punishment and section 22 only contemplates such order asthe Government can pass in its capacity as employer in respect to servants employed by it. As has been saidalready, an order of dismissal of a servant cannot be regarded as a punishment for an oﬀence punishable underparticular sections of the Indian Penal Code or of the Prevention of Corruption Act. A somewhat analogous casewould be that of a member of the Bar whose name is struck oﬀ the rolls on grounds of professional misconduct, inexercise of disciplinary jurisdiction by the proper authority. The professional misconduct might amount to acriminal oﬀence, but if we are to accept the petitioner's contention as correct, the man cannot be prosecuted for it,even though the authority inﬂicting the penalty of removal was not a competent court to investigate any criminalcharge nor was the punishment imposed in exercise of disciplinary jurisdiction a punishment for an oﬀence.In our opinion, therefore, in an enquiry under the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act of 1850, there is neither anyquestion of investigating an oﬀence in the sense of an act or omission punishable by any law for the time being inforce, nor is there any question of imposing punishment prescribed by the law which makes that act or omission anoﬀence. The learned Attorney General raised a point before us that the test of the guarantee under article 20(2) iswhether the person has been tried and punished, not for the same act, but 1162 for the same oﬀence and hiscontention is that the oﬀences here are diﬀerent, though they may arise -out of the same acts. In the view that wehave taken this question does not arise for consideration at all. It is also not necessary to express any opinion onthe question raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner as to whether for the purpose of attracting theoperation of article 20(2) the punishment must be imposed by the same authority before which the prosecutionwas conducted. The result is that, in our opinion, the petition fails and in dismissed.Petition dismissed.APPENDIX PROCEEDINGS AT THE SITTING OF THE SUPREME COURT ON NOVEMBER 5,1954.MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN C.

J.-We are meeting here this morning on a very sad occasion to mourn the death ofour brother, Mr. Justice Ghulam Hasan, who suddenly collapsed this morning at about 1 A.m. During my absencefrom Delhi to Patiala, where I had gone to visit the High Court of Pepsu, he was taken ill and was absent from Courton Monday last.On my- return I made enquiries from him and he told me that he had slight congestion in the lungs but that he wasfeeling much better and would in all likelihood attend Court on Friday. I saw him myself on Wednesday evening.He was quite cheerful and looked well, and he told me that he was feeling much better and would in all likelihoodattend Court on Friday, failing that on Monday. On Thursday morning his condition had much improved, but late inthe evening he felt uncomfortable and was removed to hospital,, where he suddenly collapsed. This is the shortstory of the termination of a successful career on the Bench and at the Bar of a very devoted and patriotic citizenof India.Shri Ghulam Hasan was born on the 3rd July, 1891. After a distinguished University career and an equally 1164distinguished career at the Bar, he was raised to the Bench of the Oudh Chief Court in 1940 and became its ChiefJudge in 1946. He was appointed Senior Judge of the Allahabad High Court in 1948 on the amalgamation of thetwo High Courts in the United Provinces. On retirement from the High Court, he was appointed a member of theLabour Appellate Tribunal and on the 8th September, 1952, he became a Judge of this Court. Prior to hisappointment as a Judge, he was a Member of the U. P. Legislative Assembly for two years.He war, also Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross and St. John Ambulance Association, U. P.Branch, since 1942. He received the honour of Knighthood of the Order of St. John in 1947 in recognition of hishumanitarian services. He was interested in educational activities and was a member of the Court of the Aligarh.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/34.h/020959579515rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml67 9/12/2S.A. VENKA TARAMAN V.

He had varied social and cultural interestswhich are quite well known and it is hardly necessary to refer to them.Both as a Member of the Bar and the Bench, Shri Ghulam Hasan distinguished himself by his vast learning, hissense of detachment and high judicial integrity. He was always courteous and patient in his relations with the Bar,as in his relations with his colleagues. If I may say so, courtesy was writ large on his face. His full grasp of facts, histhorough knowledge of law and his quick prception of the real points in a case were of great assistance to us indealing with the many complicated questions that arose for determination in this Court. He had a singularlyequable and gentle temperament. His simple and unaﬀected manner attracted friends in every sphere and he willbe very much missed not only by me and his colleagues in this Court but also in the social life of this city, whichwould be distinctly poorer for his loss.We have lost an esteemed colleague and a learned, just and upright Judge, and the country has lost a patriotic andgreat citizen. He leaves behind his widow, a son, and a daughter. We all mourn his loss with the members of hisfamily and oﬀer condolence to all of them, 1165 I am sure gentlemen of the Bar will desire to associate themselveswith the Bench in conveying an expression of heart-felt sympathy and condolence to the bereaved family.May his soul rest in peace.The Court will remain closed today as a mark of respect to the deceased.M.C.

His aﬀable personality,his genial and his uniform courtesy made a deep impression on all those who came into contact with him.Members of the Bar will never forget the keen practical sense which he brought to bear on all questions that camebefore him, the patience with which he heard them, and the invariable kindness he showed to them.The Bar tenders its deep and heart-felt sympathy to those near and dear to him in their great, sudden andirreparable loss.END OF VOL.

THE UNION OF INDIA & ANR [14] INSC 34; AIR 14 SC 35; 14 SCR 10 (30 Mah 14)on the ground that these proceedings are without jurisdiction, having been commenced 1151 in violation of thefundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed under article 20(2) of the Constitution.The petitioner was a member of the Indian Civil Service and till lately was employed as Secretary to the Ministry ofCommerce and Industries in the Government of India. Certain imputations of misbehaviour by the petitioner, whileholding oﬃces of various descriptions under the Government of India, came to the notice of the CentralGovernment and the latter being satisﬁed that there were prima facie good grounds for making an enquirydirected a formal and public enquiry to be made as to the truth or falsity of the allegations made Against thepetitioner, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act of 1850. The substance of theimputations was drawn up in the form of speciﬁc charges and Sir Arthur Trevor Harries, an ex-Chief Justice of theCalcutta High Court, was appointed Commissioner under section 3 of the said Act to conduct the enquiry andreport to the Government, on the result of the same, his opinion on the several articles of charge formulatedagainst the petitioner. The order of the Central Government directing the enquiry is dated the 21st February, 1953.The charges were drawn up under six heads with various sub-beads under each one of them. The ﬁrst chargealleged that the petitioner was guilty of misbehaviour inasmuch as he showed undue favour to Messrs. MillarsTimber and Trading Company Limited in the matter of issue of import and export licences, by abusing his positionas a public servant in the discharge of his duties, that is, by accepting illegal gratiﬁcation or valuable things forimport and export licences recommended or to be recommended by him. The second charge was to the eﬀect thatthe petitioner accepted or obtained valuable things for himself and other members of his family, without payingfor them, on diﬀerent dates from Messrs. Millars Timber and Trading Company Limited for recommending theirapplications for import licences and export permits. The fourth and the ﬁfth charges 149 1152 were similar innature to charges 1 and 2 except that they related to the Petitioners dealings with another ﬁrm known as SunderDas Saw Mills.The enquiry proceeded in the manner laid down in ,the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act. The charges were read outto the petitioner and his plea of ""not guilty"" was formally recorded. Evidence was adduced both by the prosecuteor and the defence and the witnesses on both sides were examined on oath and cross. examined and re-examinedin the usual manner. The Commissioner found, on a consideration of the evidence, that four of the charges undervarious sub-heads were proved against the petitioner and submitted a report to that eﬀect to the Government onthe 4th of May, 1953. By a letter dated the 15th of May, 1953, the Government informed the -petitioner that, oncareful consideration of the report, the President accepted the opinion of the Commissioner and in view of theﬁndings on the several charges arrived at by the latter was provisionally of opinion that the petitioner should bedismissed.Opportunity was given to the petitioner by this letter in terms of article 311(2) of the Constitution to show causeagainst the action proposed to be taken in regard to him and it was stated that any representation, which he mightdesire to make, would be taken into consideration before the ﬁnal order was passed. The petitioner, it seems, didmake a representation which was considered by the Government and after consultation with the Union PublicService Commission the President ﬁnally decided to impose the penalty of dismissal upon the petitioner. Theorder of dismissal was passed on the 17th of September, 1953. On the 23rd February, 1954, the police submitted acharge-sheet against the petitioner before the Special Judge, Sessions Court, Delhi, charging him with oﬀencesunder sections 161/165 of the Indian Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and uponthat, summons were issued by the learned Judge directing the petitioner to appear be-fore his court on the 11th ofMarch. 1954. , It is the legality of this proceeding that has been challenged 1153 before us in this writ petition. Thepetitioner's case, in substance, is that the proceedings that have been started against him are without jurisdictioninasmuch as they amount to fresh prosecution for oﬀences for which he has been prosecuted and punishedalready and this comes within the prohibition of article 20(2) of the Constitution. The sole.-point for ourconsideration is, whether in the events that have happened in this case, there has been a violation of thefundamental right of the petitioner under article 20(2) of the Constitution which would justify the issue of a writ forenforcement of the same? The scope and meaning of the guarantee implied in.article 20(2) of the Constitution has been indicated with suﬃcient fullness in the pronouncement of this court inMaqbool Hussain Y. The State of Bombay(1). . The roots of the principle, which this clause enacts, are to be foundin the well established rule of English law which ﬁnds expression in the maxim ""Nemo debet bis vexari""-a manmust not be put twice in peril for the same oﬀence. If a man is indicted again for the same oﬀence in an Englishcourt, he can plead, as a complete defence, his former acquittal or conviction, or as it is technically expressed, takethe plea of ""autrefois acquit"" or ""autrefois convict"". The corresponding provision in the Federal Constitution of theU.S.A. is contained in the Fifth Amendment, which provides inter alia: ""Nor shall any person be subjected for the.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/34.h/020959579515rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml27 9/12/2S.A.

This principle has been recognised and adopted by theIndian Legislature and is embodied in the provisions of section 26 of the General Clauses Act and section 403 of theCriminal Procedure Code.Although these were the materials which formed the background of the guarantee of the fundamental right givenin article 20(2) of the Constitution, the ambit and contents of the guarantee, as this court pointed out in the casereferred to above, are much narrower than those of the common law rule in England or the doctrine of ""doublejeopardy"" in the American (1) [ 1953] S.C.R- 703.1154 Constitution. Article,20(2)of our Constitution,it is to be noted, does not contain the principle of ""autrefoisacquit"" at all. It seems that our Constitution makers did not think it necessary to raise one part of the common lawrule to the level of a fundamental right and thus make it immune from legislative interference. This has been left tobe regulated by the general law of the land. In order to enable a citizen to invoke the protection of clause (2) ofarticle 20 of the Constitution, there must have been both prosecution and punishment in respect of the sameoﬀence.The words prosecuted and punished"" are to be taken not district butively so as to mean prosecuted or punished.Both the factors must co-exist in order that the operation of the clause may be attracted. The position is alsodiﬀerent under the American Constitution. There the prohibition is not against a second punishment but againstthe peril in which a person may be placed by reason of a valid indictment being presented against him, before acompetent court, followed by proper arraignment and plea and a lawful impanelling of the jury. It is not necessaryto have a verdict at all(1).It has also been held by this court in Maqbool Hussain's case(2) that the language of article 20 and the wordsactually used in it aﬀord a clear indication that the proceedings in connection with the prosecution andpunishment of a person must be in the nature of a criminal proceeding, before a court of law or judicial tribunal,and not before a tribunal which entertains a departmental or an administrative enquiry even though set up by astatute, but which is not required by law to try a matter judicially and on legal evidence. In that case theproceedings were taken under the Sea Customs Act before a Customs authority who ordered conﬁscation ofgoods. It was held that such proceedings were not ""Prosecution"", nor the order of conﬁscation a ""punishment""within the meaning of article 20(2) inasmuch as the Customs authority was not a court or a judicial tribunal andmerely exercised administrative powers vested in him for revenue purposes.(1) Vide Wills on Constitutional Law, p. 528.(2) [ 1953] S.C.R.- 703.1155 The facts of this case are no doubt diﬀerent and the point that requires determination is, whether thepetitioner can be said to have, satisﬁed all the conditions that are necessary to enable him to claim the protectionof article 20(2) The charges, upon which the petitioner is being prosecuted now, are charges under sections 161and 165 of the Indian Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. We will assume for ourpresent purpose that the allegations upon which these charges are based are substantially the same which formedthe subject matter of enquiry under the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act of 1850.The question narrows down to this"

The adoption was challenged on theground that there was no gathering of the brotherhood. The learned Judges (Addison and Beckett JJ.) held that itwas immaterial whether there was or was not a gathering of the brotherhood at the time.It appears that the adopter had made a statement in Court acknowledging the appointment or adoption inquestion. The next day he celebrated the marriage of the boy as his son, and thereafter he looked after hiseducation and allowed him to describe himself as his adopted son or appointed heir, and the boy lived with him ashis son. The learned Judges held that the details given in the answers to questions in various Customary Laws werenot necessarily mandatory but might be merely indicatory.In Jowala v. Dewan Singh(1) Tek Chand J. held ""that an adoption of a collateral in the fourth degree, among Jats ofMauza Hussanpur, Tahsil Nakodar, District Jullundur, is valid although nearer collaterals are alive."" He also held""that an entry in the Riwaj-i-am as to the persons who can be adopted is merely indicatory"".In a case from Delhi reported in Basant Singh and Others v.Brij Raj Saran Singh(2)the Privy Council held ""that the restriction in the Riwaj-i-am of adoption to persons of thesame gotra is recommendatory and a person of a diﬀerent gotra may be adopted."" Counsel for the appellantsfrankly conceded that he could cite no case where the declarations governing customary adoptions were held tobe mandatory.Whether a particular rule recorded in the Riwaj-i-am is mandatory or directory must depend on what is theessential characteristic of the custom. Under the Hindu Law adoption is primarily a religious act intended to conferspiritual beneﬁt on the adopter and some of the rules have, therefore, been held to be mandatory and compliancewith them regarded as a condition of the validity of the adoption. On the other hand, under the (1) 166 I.C. 237.(2) 57 All, 494.51 Customary Law in the Punjab, adoption is secular in character, the object being to appoint an heir and the rulesrelating to ceremonies and to preferences in selection have to be held to be directory and adoptions made indisregard of them are not invalid.There is no substance in the appeal and we dismiss it with costs.Appeal dismissed.Civil Appeal No. 124 of 1951.Appeal by Special Leave granted by His Majesty in Council, dated the 30th October, 1945, from the Judgment andDecree, dated the 12th July, 1944, of the High Court of Judicature at Lahore in Civil Regular Second Appeal No. 450of 1942, against the Judgment and Decree, dated the 14th January, 1942, of the Court of the District Judge,Gurdaspur, in Appeal No. 91 of 1941, arising from the Judgment and Decree, dated 31st July, 1941, of the Court ofSenior Subordinate Judge, Gurdaspur, in Suit No. 80 of 1940.G.

Gurmej Singh, respondent No. 2, is a collateral of Harnam Singh in the8th degree.The appellants sued for a declaration that the deed of adoption executed by Harnam Singh on July 30, 1940,adopting Gurmej Singh was invalid and could not aﬀect the reversionary rights of the appellants after the death ofHarnam Singh. The appellant's case was that under the Customary Law of Gurdaspur District applicable to the GillJats ,of village Gillanwali, Harnam Singh could only adopt a is near collateral"" and Gurmej Singh being a distantcollateral his adoption was invalid. The defence was a denial of the plaintiﬀs' claim. Both the trial Judge and theDistrict Judge on appeal held that the factum and the validity of the adoption were fully established. In secondappeal Trevor Harries C. J. and Mahajan J. (as he then was) held that there was suﬃcient evidence of the factum ofadoption as furnished by the deed and the subsequent conduct of Harnam Singh. They held that all that wasnecessary under the custom to constitute an adoption was the expression of a clear intention on the part of theadoptive father to adopt the boy concerned as his son and this intention was clearly manifested here by theexecution and registration of the deed of adoption coupled with the public declarations and treatment as adoptedson. Upon the legal validity of the adoption the High Court found that the answer to Question 9 of the Riwaj-i-amof Gurdaspur District of the year 1913 laying down that the adoption of ""near collaterals only "" was recognised wasnot mandatory. The High Court relied in support of their 46 conclusion on a decision of Tek Chand J. in Jowala v.Diwan Singh (1) and the Privy Council decision in Basant Singh v.Brij Raj Saran Singh (2).The ﬁrst question regarding the factum of adoption need not detain us long. The deed of adoption, Exhibit D. 1,recites that Harnam Singh had no male issue who could perform his kiry a karam ceremony after his death, thatGurmej Singh had been brought up while he was an infant by his wife and that he had adopted him according tothe prevailing custom. The recital continues that since the adoption he had been treating and calling Gurmej Singhas his adopted son. This fact was well,-known in the village and the adoptee was en- joying all rights of a son. Hehad executed a formal document in his favour in order to put an end to any dispute which might be raised abouthis adoption. As adopted son he made him the owner of all of his property. We are satisﬁed that there is ampleevidence to sustain the ﬁnding on the factum of adoption.The main question which falls to be considered is whether under the terms of the Riwaj-i-am applicable to theparties, Gurmej Singh being a collateral of Harnam Singh in the 8th degree could be validly adopted. The customin question is founded on Question 9 and its answer the Customary Law of the Gurdaspur District. They are asfollows:- "" Question 9. Is there any rule by which it is required that the person adopted should be related to theperson adopting ? If so, what relatives may be adopted ? Is any preference required to be shown to particularrelatives ? If so, enumerate them in order of preference. Is it necessary that the adopted son and his adoptivefather should be (1) of the same caste or -tribe; (2) of the same got? Answer"

The plaintiﬀs contend that the property is ancestral and that.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/37. h/0209595795i95wwwiiase95tml14 9/12/2GOPAL SINGH & ORS V. UJAGAR SINGH & ORS [14] INSC 37; AIR 14 SC 59; 15 SCR 86 (2 Aprl 14)the daughter got only a life estate, so they sue for 'a declaration that the gift will not aﬀect their reversionaryrights.The defendants rely on custom. They state that, according to the customary law which governs the parties,collaterals beyond the ﬁfth degree are not heirs in the presence of a daughter and her line. The plaintiﬀs, they say,are collaterals of the seventh degree therefore they cannot displace the daughter. They also state that theproperty was not ancestral and so the plaintiﬀs cannot challenge the daughter's alienation. The third line ofdefence related to a portion of the property which is not in dispute before us.The property in suit consisted of three items:(1) 253 bighas of Khas land;(2) a half share in 3 bighas 19 biswas; and (3) a share in certain shamlat property.The defendants say that Harnam Singh gifted 123 bighas of the Khas land to the second defendantthat the giftwas absolute and so the plaintiﬀs cannot,get that portion of the property in any event.The trial Judge held, on the admission of the plaintiﬀs' counsel, that the land in dispute was non-ancestral and thatthe daughter's sons would succeed after her to the exclusion of the plaintiﬀs, therefore the gift by her to her sonsamounted to an acceleration of the estate. The learned Judge dismissed the plaintiﬀs Suit, 88 On appeal to thelower appellate Court- the ﬁnding ,that the property was non-ancestral was upheld as the plaintiﬀs' learnedcounsel in that Court did not contest the ﬁnding of the ﬁrst Court on this point. As regards the acceleration, thelearned Judge thought it necessary to examine a point which the plaintiﬀs had raised in the trial Court but whichwas ignored there, namely that a house was not included in the gift. Therefore it was argued that as the whole ofthe estate was not passed on to the next heir there was no acceleration. The learned Judge took evidence on thispoint and held that the house was not included and so found against the defendants. Accordingly he decreed theplaintiﬀs' claim for this part of the estate.In the High Court the learned Judges upheld the concurrent ﬁnding about the non-ancestral nature of theproperty.Before them also the point was conceded by the plaintiﬀ 's counsel. They also held that the house was not includedin the gift but held that it was such a small part of the estate that the daughter's retention of it could not indicatean intention on her part not to eﬀace herself from the estate. They also held in the plaintiﬀs' favour that they werecollaterals in the ﬁfth degree and not the seventh but held that as the property was non-ancestral the daughter'ssons were the nearest heirs, so the gift accelerated the estate and, vested it in the donees despite the exclusion ofthe house. Accordingly, they reversed the decree of the lower appellate Court and restored that of the learned trialJudge.Before us, the plaintiﬀs' learned counsel tried to reopen the concurrent ﬁnding of the three Courts about the non-ancestral nature of the property but we did not allow him to do so. The question is a mixed question of law and factand the admission involved both. We were not shown how the facts admitted could be disentangled from the lawso that we could determine whether the conclusion of law drawn from the admitted facts was wrong. The learnedtrial Judge said that the admission was made because of a previous decision in a former suit between the. sameparties or their predecessors, Harnam Singh had mortgaged a part of 89 his estate and placed the mortgagees inpossession. When he died some of his collaterals took possession of the unencumbered portion of the estate. Thedaughter Mat. Biro therefore instituted two suits, one for possession against the collaterals including the presentplaintiﬀs or their predecessors, and the other for a declaration against the mortgagees in possession. In this shealso joined the same set of collaterals. Mist. Biro succeeded on the ground that the property was non-ancestral.These ﬁndings are obviously res-judicata and if the plaintiﬀs' learned counsel had not conceded the point thequestion 'would at once have been raised and the previous judgments, which were exhibited (Exhibits DD and DF)would-have concluded the matter. But as the point was conceded in all three' Courts it was not necessary for thedefendants to fall back on the previous decisions. It, must therefore be accepted here that the whole of the land indispute was non-ancestral.That brings us to the question of heirship. Paragraph 23(2) of Rattigan's Digest' of Customary Law says that- Inregard to the acquired property of her father, the daughter is preferred to the collaterals."" That is not disputed butwhat the plaintiﬀs contend is that she only succeeds as a limited heir and that after her the reversion will go to thefather's heirs in the usual way..liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/37. h/0209595795i95wwwiiase95tml24 9/12/2GOPAL SINGH & ORS V. UJAGAR SINGH & ORS [14] INSC 37; AIR 14 SC 59; 15 SCR 86 (2 Aprl 14)But that is not the Punjab custom among the tribe to which the parties belong, namely agricultural Jats. Rattiganquotes the following passage from page 61 of Roe and Rattigan's Tribal -Law-of the Punjab at page 411 of the 13thedition of his Digest:"" Where a succession of a married daughter is allowed, the general principle is that she succeeds not as an ordinaryheir,, but merely as the means of passing on the property to another male, whose descent from her father in thefemale line is allowed under exceptional circumstances to count as if it were descent in the male line. She willindeed continue to hold the land in her own name, even after the birth of sons and their attaining majority, for herown life but she has no more power over it than a widow would have.If she has sons, the estate will of Course descend to them and their lineal male issue, in the usual way. But if shehas no sons, 12 90 or if their male issue fail, the land will revert, except in some special instances where herhusband is allowed to hold for his life, to her father's agnates, just as it would have done if no exception to thegeneral rule of agnatic succession had ever been in her favour."" This is supported by at least two decisions from thePunjab.In Lehna v., Mst. Thakri (1) two learned Judges of the Punjab Chief Court (the third dissenting) said 'in the course ofa Full Bench decision, that even in the case of ancestral property the daughter's sons and their descendants wouldexclude collaterals of the father. In a more recent case (1953) the Punjab High Court held in Lal Singh v. Roor Singh(2) that in the case of non-ancestral property the daughters are preferred to collaterals.We were told that this rule only applies when the daughter succeeds and has no application when she predeceasesher father. We say nothing about this because the case before us is one in which the daughter did succeed and allthe authorities produced before us indicate that in that event her sons will exclude the collaterals. We were notshown any decision which has taken a contrary view. We are only concerned with non-ancestral property here andexpress no opinion aboutwhat would happen in the case of ancestral proper though the observations of two of thelearned Judges in the fullBench of the Punjab Chief Court to whichwe have referred carry the rule over to ancestralproperty as well.The learned counsel for the plaintiﬀs relies on, paragraph 64 of Rattigan's Digest where it is stated that except intwo cases which do -not apply here, no female in possession of property from, among others, her father canpermanently alienate it. But we are not concerned with an alienation here. The gift to the sons mayor may not begood after Mst.Biro's death as a gift. The question is whether there was an acceleration. If there was, the form it took would notmatter.We turn, next, to the question of surrender and the. only question there is whether the retention by Mst. Biro ofthe house would prevent an acceleration of the (1) 32 Punjab Record 1895.(2) 55 Punjab Law Reporter 168 at 172.91 estate, The extent of the property covered by the gift is over 253 bighas. She had an absolute right to gift 123bighas of this and so the only portion to which the doctrine of surrender would apply would be the remaining 130odd bighas. But the fact that she gave away all her property to her sons, bar this house, including property towhich she had an absolute right, is relevant to show that her intention was to eﬀace herself completely. Now asregards this house. Garja Singh (P.W. 1) gives us this description of it:"" The distance between the door of the Sabbat and that of Darwaja is only about two karams. "" (eleven feet).""opposite to Darwaja there is one Jhallani the door of which opens into the Sabbat and not in the courtyard.Except Darwaja, Sabbat and Jhallani there is no other roofed portion in their house. There is only one compoundfor the cattle."" In this tiny dwelling live not only Mst. Biro but also her three sons. It forms, as the High Court held, avery small part of the whole property. The retention of this, particularly in these circumstances when the sonsalready live there with her, would not invalidate the surrender.The law about this has been correctly set out in Mulla's Hindu Law, 11th edition, page 217, in the following terms:"" But the omission, due to ignorance or to oversight,, of a small portion of the whole property does not aﬀect thevalidity of the surrender when it is otherwise bona ﬁde.""' The present case is, in our opinion, covered by that rule..liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/37. h/0209595795i95wwwiiase95tml34 9/12/2GOPAL SINGH & ORS V.

That being the case, the plaintiﬀsare no longer the reversions even if they would otherwise have been entitled to succeed on failure of thedaughter's sons and their line' We need not decide whether the plaintiﬀs, as collaterals in the ﬁfth degree, wouldbe heirs at all.The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed."

The Special Magistrate trying the case was appointedby the Madhya Pradesh Government under section 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as the petitioner wasa servant of the Government of Madras, the prosecution against him was initiated with the sanction given by theGovernment of Madras under section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Held, (i) that section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code in so far as it authorises the Provincial Government toconfer upon any person all or any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the Code on Magistrates ofthe ﬁrst, second or third class in 169 respect of particular oases and thereby to constitute a Special Magistrate forthe trial of an individual case, does not violate the guarantee under article 14 of the Constitution as the SpecialMagistrate in the present case had to try the case entirely under the normal procedure and no discrimination ofthe-kind contemplated by the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar's Case ([ 1952] S.C.R. 284) arose in the present case.

It is said that though the exercise of thepower under section 197(2) in so far as it relates to speciﬁcation of the Court is concerned is discretionary andoptional, but if in an individual case, that power is not exercised, it must be taken that the appropriateGovernment did not feel called upon to allot the case 'to any special Court, and that, therefore, such allotment byanother Government under section 14 would aﬀect or nullify the power of the appropriate Government undersection 197(2).It is also suggested that such dual exercise of the power by two Governments would be contrary to the policyunderlying section 197 which is for the protection of the public ser- vant concerned, by interposing the sanction ofthe Government between, the accuser and its servants of the categories speciﬁed therein. This argument isfarfetched.In the ﬁrst instance, there is no reason to think that section 197(2) is inspired by any policy of protection of theconcerned public servant, as section 197(1) is. There can be no question of protection involved by an accused beingtried by one Court rather than by another at the choice of the Government. The power under section 197(2)appears to be vested in the appropriate Government for being exercised, on grounds of convenience, or thecomplexity or gravity of the case or other relevant considerations. The argument as to 173 the implication of non-exercise of the power by the appropriate Government under section 197(2) is also untenable. The power to specifya Court for trial in such cases is a permissive power, and there can be no such implication, as is contended for,arising from the non- exercise of the power.This entire argument, however, is based on a misconception of the respective scopes of the powers under, section197(2) and section 14. The one relates to the ""Court"" and the other to the ""Person"". Under sub-section (2) of section197, the sanctioning Government may specify a. Court for the trial of the' case but is not bound to do so. When itdoes not choose to specify the Court, the trial is subject to the operation of the other provisions of the Code. Buteven when it chooses to exercise the power of specifying the Court before which the trial is to be held, suchspeciﬁcation of the Court does not touch the question as to who is the person to function in such Court beforewhich the trial is to take place. That is a matter still left to be exercised by the Provincial Government of the areawhere the trial is to take place.

THE ST ATE OF MADHYA PRADESH [14] INSC 38; AIR 14 SC 32; 14 SCR 18 (5 Ap ril 14)In addition to the above three points, learned counsel for the petitioners has also raised a further point that in thepresent case Shri K. L. Pandey who was ﬁrst appointed as a Special Magistrate for the trial of the case, and towhose ﬁle on such appointment this case was transferred, was later on appointed as acting Sessions Judge forsome time and ceased to have this case before him. He reverted back from his position as acting Sessions Judge tohis original post. The point taken is that without a fresh notiﬁcation appointing him as Special Magistrate andtransferring the case to him as such, he cannot be said to be seized of this case as Special Magistrate. Here again,learned counsel for the State informs us, without conceding the point so taken, that he is prepared to advise theGovernment 174 to issue the necessary notiﬁcation and have the case transferred. In view of that statement, it isunnecessary to pronounce on the objection so raised.In the result, all the points raised on behalf of the petitioners fail, and this petition must be dismissed.It is desirable to observe that the questions above dealt with appear to have been raised before the High Court atprevious stages by means of applications under article 226 and decided against. No appeals to this Court havebeen taken against the orders therein. Nothing that we have said is intended to be a pronouncement as to thecorrectness or otherwise of those orders, nor to encourage the practice of direct approach to this Court (except forgood reasons) in matters which have been taken to the High Court and found against, without obtaining leave toappeal therefrom.Petition dismissed.Petition No. 55 of 1954.Under article 32 of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights.N. C. Chatterjee, (J. B. Dadachanji and Rajinder Narain, with him) for the petitioners.K. V. Tambe and I. N. Shroﬀ for the respondent.1954. April 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is a petition under article 32of the Constitution and is presented to this Court under the following circumstances. Petitioner No. I before us wasan Agricultural Demonstrator of the Government of Madras and was employed as an Assistant Marketing Oﬃcerin Central Provinces and Berar for the purchase and movement of blackgram and other grains on behalf of theMadras Government. He, as well as the second petitioner and 44 others, are under prosecution before Shri K. E.Pandey, a Special Magistrate of Nagpur, Madhya Pradesh, in Case No. I of 1949 pending before him on charges ofcheating, attempt to commit cheating, criminal breach of trust 22 170 and criminal conspiracy, (i.e., for oﬀencespunishable under section 420 read with section 120-B or 109 of the Indian Penal Code, section 409 and section 409read with section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code) and the allegation is that by reason of the acts committed by theaccused, the Government of Madras had to incur an expenditure of Rs.3,57,147-10-0 in excess of the amount due. The Special Magistrate before whom the case is now pending wasappointed by the Madhya Pradesh Government under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and as the ﬁrstpetitioner was a servant of the Government of Madras, the prosecution against him has been initiated by sanctiongiven by the Government of Madras under section 197(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.The validity of the prosecution is challenged on various grounds, and the present petition is for quashing theproceedings on the ground of their invalidity. The three main points taken before us are: (1) Section 14 of theCriminal Procedure Code, in so far as it authorises the Provincial Government to confer upon any person all or anyof the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the Code on a Magistrate of the ﬁrst, second or third class inrespect of particular cases and thereby to constitute a Special Magistrate for the trial of an individual case, violatesthe guarantee under article 14 of the Constitution;(2) The sanction given under section 197(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code for the prosecution as against the ﬁrstpetitioner is invalid, inasmuch as the order of the Madras Government granting the sanction does not disclose thatall the facts constituting the oﬀences to be charged were placed before the sanctioning authority ; nor does thesanction state the time or place of the occurrence or the transactions involved in it, or the persons with whom theoﬀences were committed. This contention is raised relying on the Privy Council case in Gokulchand DwarkadasMorarka v.The King(1); (3) Even if the sanction under section 197 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code is valid, it is for the veryGovernment which accords the sanction to specify also the Court before (1) A.I.R. 1948 P.C. 82.171 which the trial is to be held under section 197(2) and in the absence -of any such speciﬁcation by the saidGovernment, the power under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code of appointing a Special Magistrate forthe trial of the case cannot be exercised by the Madhya Pradesh Government.These points may now be dealt with seriatim. In support of the objection raised under article 14 of theConstitution, reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in Anwar Ali Sarkar's case (1). That decision, however,applies only to a case where on the allotment of an. individual case to a special Court authorised to conduct thetrial by a procedure substantially diﬀerent from the normal procedure, discrimination arises as between personswho have committed similar oﬀences, by one or more out of them being subjected to a procedure, which is.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/38.html/0209595695695www9524 9/12/2M.

In the pre- sent case, the SpecialMagistrate under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code has to try the case entirely under the normalprocedure, and no discrimination of the kind contemplated by the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar's case (1) and theother cases following it arises here. A law vesting discretion in an authority under such circumstances cannot besaid to be discriminatory as such, and is therefore not hit by article 14 of the Constitution. There is, therefore, nosubstance in this contention.As regards the second ground which is put forward on the authority of the Privy Council case of GokulchandDwarkadas Morarka v. The King(2), it is admitted that the trial has not yet commenced. The Privy Council itself inthe case mentioned above has recognised that the lacunas, if any, in the sanction of the kind contemplated by thatdecision can be remedied in the course of the trial by the speciﬁc evidence in that behalf. Learned counsel for theState, without conceding the objection raised, has mentioned to us that evidence in that behalf will be given at thetrial. It is, therefore, unnecessary to decide the point whether or not the sanction, as it is, and without suchevidence is invalid.(1) [ 1952] INSC 1; [ 1952] S.C.R. 284.(2) A.I.R. 1948 P.C. 82.172 It is the third point that has been somewhat seriously pressed before us. The contention of learned counsel forthe petitioners is based on sub-section (2) of section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which runs as follows"
2253,BISWABHUSAN NAIK V. THE STATE OF ORISSA [1954] INSC 39; AIR 1954 SC 359; 1955 SCR 92 (7 April 1954).pdf,"Held, that it is not necessary for the sanction for an oﬀence punishable under section 5(2) of the Prevention ofCorruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947) to be in any Particular form or in writing or for it to set out the facts in respectof which it is given. It is, however, desirable to state the facts on the face of sanction, because when the facts arenot set out in the sanction, proof has to be given aliunde that sanction was given in respect of the factsconstituting the oﬀence charged but an omission to set out the facts in the sanction is not fatal so long as the factscan be and are proved in some other way.Where the sanction was conﬁned to section 5(2) of the Act, it could not, under the circumstances of the case, haverelated to anything but clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 5 and therefore an omission to mention clause (a) inthe sanction did not invalidate it.under section 5(3) of the Act all that the prosecution has to do is to show that the accused or some person on hisbehalf is in possession of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income and forwhich the accused cannot satisfactorily account. Once that is established then the Court is bound to presumeunless the contrary is proved, that the accused is guilty of the new oﬀence created by section 5 namely criminalmisconduct in the discharge of his oﬃcial duty.Held, also that there was no illegality either in the sanction or in the charge on the ground that no particulars weregiven because the oﬀence under section 5(1)(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act does not consist of individualacts of bribe taking as in section 161 I.P. C. but is of a general character and individual instances are not necessarybecause of the presumption which section 5(3) requires the Court to draw.Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka v.

Patnaik and R. C. Prasad, for the appellant.R. Ganapathy lyer, for the respondent.1954. April 7. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J. -The appellant was an Inspector of Factoriesunder the Government of Orissa. 'It was a part of his duty to inspect factories and mills in the State of Orissa. Hetoured the districts of Koraput and Balasore from 18th August, 1948, to 27th August, 1948, and from 29thSeptember, 1948, to 30th October, 1948, respectively. The prosecution case is that he collected bribes frompersons connected with some of the mills he inspected in those districts. It is said that he used to threaten to closetheir mills and impose other penalties for alleged defects unless they paid him a bribe.On 3rd October, 1948, he was camping at the Dak Bungalow at Basta in the Balasore district. Because ofinformation received against him his person and belongings were searched on that day and a sum of Rs. 3,148 wasrecovered from him consisting of Rs. 450 paid at the time as a trap and Rs.2,698 already in his possession. He was arrested on the spot but was later released on bail.Departmental and other proceedings were taken against him and he was eventually brought to trial on 29thMarch, 1950, and charged under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (II of 1947) for criminalmisconduct in the shape of habitually accepting illegal gratiﬁcation. He was also separately charged andseparately prosecuted under section 161 of the Indian Penal Code for three speciﬁc oﬀences of bribe taking but weare not concerned here with that as he was acquitted on all three counts. His, conviction here is under section 5(2)alone. The trial Court 94 sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for four years and a ﬁne of Rs. 5,000. The HighCourt upheld the conviction on appeal but reduced the sentence to two years and a ﬁne of Rs. 3,000.The accused applied for a certiﬁcate to appeal under article 134(1)(c) on three points. The High Court held that twoof them were not of suﬃcient importance to justify the issue of a certiﬁcate-particullarly as one of the two wascovered by the principle laid down by this Court. But it granted leave on all three as it considered that the ﬁrstpoint was of importance. The points were formulated as follows:""(i) whether the view of this Court as to the requirement of sanction in a case of this kind and the interpretation ofMorarka's case in A.I.R. 1948 P.C. p. 82 adopted by this Court in its judgment are correct;(ii)whether the interpretation of this Court relating to the requirements as to the corroboration of an accomplicewitness in a bribery case with reference to the latest unreported case of the Supreme Court which has beenreferred to in the judgment and which has since been reported in 1952 S.C.J. p. 46 is correct;and (iii)whether the law as propounded by the decision now' sought to be appealed against with reference to theconsiderations that arise in judging the presumptions under section 5(3) of the Prevention of Corruption Act iscorrect."" The ﬁrst point arises in this way. Four kinds of criminal misconduct are set out in section 5 of thePrevention of Corruption Act. They are enumerated in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of sub-section (1). The sanction isgeneral and does not specify which of these four oﬀences was, meant.It runs as follows:"" Government of Orissa.Commerce and Labour Department.Order No. 4561/Com., dated 3-11-1948.In pursuance of section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (II of 1947), the Governor of 95 Orissa is herebypleased to accord sanction for prosecution of Sri B.

TE SAE OF OSA [14] IC 39; AIR 14 SC 39; 15 SR 92 ( 7 Aprl 14)By order of the governor, Sd./-V. Ramanathan, Secretary to Government.It was contended that the Privy Council held in Gokutchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. The King(1) that such asanction is invalid. The High Court rejected this argument. We agree with the High Court.The passage of the Privy Council judgment on which reliance is placed is as follows ""In their Lordships' view, inorder to comply with the provisions of clause 23 it must be proved that the sanction was given in respect of thefacts constituting the oﬀence charged. It is plainly desirable that the facts should be' referred to on th; face of thesanction but this is not essential since clause 23 does not require the sanction to be in an particular form nor evento be in writing. But if the facts constituting the oﬀence charged are not known on the face of the sanction, theprosecution must prove by extraneous evidence that those facts were placed before the sanctioning authority.""The Judgment of the Judicial Committee relates to clause 23 of the Cotton Cloth and Yarn (Control). Order, 1943,but the principles apply here. It is no more necessary for the sanction under the Prevention of Corruption Act to bein any particular form, or in writing or for it to set out the facts in respect of which it is given than it was underclause 23 of the Order which their Lordships were considering. The desirability of such a course is obvious becausewhen the facts are not set out in the sanction proof has to be given (1) A.I.R. 1948 P.C. 82.96 aliunde that sanction was given in respect of the facts constituting the oﬀence charged, but an omission to doso is not fatal so long as the facts can be, and are, proved in some other way.The High Court ﬁnds that the facts to which the sanction relates were duly placed before the proper sanctioningauthority. We need not consider the evidence about telephone calls and the like because the letter of the DistrictMagistrate asking for sanction (Exhibit 26) is enough to show the facts on which the sanction is based.'It is in these terms:""I have the honour to report that Sri B.B. Nayak, Inspector of Factories, Orissa, in the course of his visit to thisdistrict had been -visiting certain mills, and on information received by me that he had been collecting heavy sumsas illegal gratiﬁcation from the Manager or Proprietor of Mills under threat of mischief to the mill owners, it wasarranged to verify the truth of this information by handing over 3 hundred rupee notes marked with my initials inpresence of the Superintendent of Police and two other respectable gentlemen and millowners, on the evening ofthe 2nd October, 1948. On the 3rd October the Factory Inspector having actually received the illegal gratiﬁcationof Rs.45o which sum included the three marked hundred rupee notes, the Prosecuting Inspector seized the markednotes along with a further heavy sum of Rs. 2,698 from his possession.Under section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, the accused being a public servant in the employ of theProvincial Government the sanction of the Provincial Government is necessary prior to taking cognisance of anoﬀence under section 161, Indian Penal Code or subsection (2) of section 5 of the Act."" A sanction based on thefacts set out in this letter,.namely the information received about the collection of heavy sums as bribes and the ﬁnding of Rs. 2,698 in hispossession would be suﬃcient to validate the present prosecution. It is evident from this letter and from the otherevidence that the facts placed before the 97 Government could only relate to oﬀences under section 161 of theIndian Penal Code and clause (a) of section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. They could not relate toclauses (b) or (c). Therefore, when the sanction was conﬁned to section 5 (2) it could not, in the circumstances ofthe case, have related to anything but clause (a) of sub- section (1) of section 5. Therefore, the omission tomention clause (a) in the sanction does not invalidate it.The present prosecution is conﬁned to section 5(1)(a) which runs as follows:""(1) A public servant is said to commit the oﬀence of criminal misconduct in the discharge of his duty(a) if hehabitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any otherperson, any gratiﬁcation (other than legal remuneration) as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in section 161of the Indian Penal Code."" Then comes sub-section (3) which sets out a new rule of evidence in these terms:""In any trial of an oﬀence punishable under subsection (2) the fact that the accused person or any other person onhis behalf is in possession, for which the accused person cannot satisfactorily account, of pecuniary resources orproperty disproportionate to his known sources of income may be proved, and on such proof the Court shalliofin d.org/in/cs/cen/IC/14/3/SWUHTTRIS95NS95595Ci95www.liiaaseNS959.html34 9/12/ 2020BIAB HSAN NAIK V. TE SAE OF OSA [14] IC 39; AIR 14 SC 39; 15 SR 92 ( 7 Aprl 14)presume, unless the contrary is proved, that the accused person is guilty of criminal misconduct in the discharge ofhis oﬃcial duty and his conviction therefor shall not be invalid by reason only that it is based solely on suchpresumption."" Therefore, all that the prosecution has to do is to show that the accused, or some person on hisbehalf, is in possession of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income and forwhich the accused cannot satisfactorily account. Once that is established then the Court has to presume, unlessthe contrary is proved, that the accused is guilty of the new oﬀence created by section 5, namely criminalmisconduct in the discharge of his oﬃcial duty.13 98 Now the accused was found in possession of Rs. 3,148. He accounted for Rs. 450 of that sum by showing thatit was paid to him at the time as a trap. He has been acquitted of that oﬀence, so all he had to account for was thebalance Rs. 2,698. This is a large sum for a touring oﬃcer to carry with him in cash while on tour. His explanationwas not considered satisfactory and that is a question of fact with which we are not concerned in this Court.Therefore, all that remains to be seen is whether this was disproportionate to his known sources of income.The accused is a Government Factory Inspector and we were told that his salary is only Rs. 450 a month. The HighCourt ﬁnds that the total sums drawn by him during his entire period of service of thirteen months was Rs. 6,045 assalary and Rs. 2,155 as travelling allowance. It also ﬁnds that he owns 0.648 acres of land which brings in noincome worth the name. On the expenditure side of the accused's account the High Court ﬁnds that he has asubstantial family establishment which would not leave him enough margin for saving such a large sum of money.No other source of income has been disclosed. It is evident that no touring oﬃcer of his status and in his positionwould require such a large sum of money for his touring purposes even if he was away from headquarters for amonth. His explanation was considered unsatisfactory by both Courts and was disbelieved. These are all questionsof fact. Once the facts set out above were found to exist and the explanation of the accused rejected asunsatisfactory, section 5(3) was at once attracted and the Court was bound to presume (the word used in thesection is ""shall"" and not ""may"") that the accused was guilty under section 5(2), especially as this part of the sectiongoes on to say- ""and his conviction therefor shall not be invalid by reason only that it is based solely on suchpresumption."" These facts alone are enough to sustain the conviction and we need not consider the other matters.The High Court was right in holding that the sanction was suﬃcient and in convicting the accused.99 The third point set out in the certiﬁcate of the High Court relates to the absence of particulars in the charge and,we gathered from the arguments, in the sanction. But no particulars need be set out in the charge in such a casebecause the oﬀence under section 5(1)(a) does not consist of individual acts of bribe taking as in section 161 of theIndian Penal Code but is of a general character. Individual instances may be useful to prove the general avermentin particular cases but it is by no means necessary because of the presumption which section 5(3) requires theCourt to draw. There was therefore no illegality either in the sanction or in the charge; nor has the accused beenprejudiced because he knew everything that was being urged against him and led evidence to refute the facts onwhich the prosecution relied. He was also questioned about the material facts set out above in his examinationunder section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code and was given a chance then as well to give such explanation ashe wished.The appeal fails and is dismissed.Appeal dismissed."

Laxmi and in that connectionmy maternal grandmother and maternal great grandmother got the gift deed registered. This very gift deed wasgot executed by my maternal grandmother and maternal great grandmother and had got it registered.Through this gift deed Mot. Laxmi held possession over it till she was alive. She had kept deponent as her son andso 8 58 she got the rent notes executed in my name.""' What is admitted by a party to be true must be presumed tobe true unless the contrary is shown. There is no evidence to the contrary in the case. The gift deed fully supportsthe testimony of the plaintiﬀ on this point. It deﬁnitely states that according to the will, the gift deed was executedin favour of Laxmi and it further recites that Laxmi was entitled to deal with the house in any manner she liked.Those who were directed to execute the oral will made by Ramchandra must be presumed to have carried out hisdirections in accordance with his wishes. It seems clear that the intention of the testator was to beneﬁt hisdaughter, Laxmi, and to confer upon her the same title as he himself possessed. She was the sole object of hisbounty and on the attendant circumstances of this case it is plain that he intended to confer on her whatever titlehe himself had. Laxmi therefore became the absolute owner of the property under the terms of the oral will of herfather and the plaintiﬀ is no heir to the property which under the law devolved on Laxmi's husband who had fullright to alienate it.We are further of the opinion that the High Court was in error in thinking that it is a settled principle of law thatunless there are express terms in the deed of gift to indicate that the donor who had absolute interest intended toconvey absolute ownership, a gift in favour of an heir who inherits only a limited interest cannot be construed asconferring an absolute interest. It is true that this was the principle once deduced from the Privy Council decisionin Mahomed Shumool V. Shewukram(1) wherein it was held that a bequest to a daughter-in-law passed a limitedestate. The proposition laid down in Mahomed Shumsool's case was construed by the High Courts in India to meanthat a gift of immovable property to a woman could not be deemed to confer upon her an absolute estate ofinheritance which she could alienate at her pleasure unless the deed or will gave her in express terms a heritableestate or power of alienation.Later decisions of the Judicial Committee made it clear that if words were used (1) 2 I.A. 7.59 conferring absolute ownership upon the wife, the wife enjoyed the rights of ownership without their being con-ferred by express and additional terms. Shumsool's case(1) has been examined in recent years in some High Courtsand it has been observed that according to the law as understood at present there is no presumption one way orthe other and there is no diﬀerence between the case of a male and the case of a female, and the fact that thedonee is a woman does not make the gift any the less absolute where the words would be suﬃcient to convey anabsolute estate to a male (see Nagammal v. Subbalakshmi Ammal(2). The matter has now been set at rest by thedecision of this Court in Ram Gopal v. Nand Lal(3). In this case it was observed as follows:-- "" It may be taken to bequite settled that there is no warrant for the proposition of law that when a grant of an immovable property ismade to a Hindu female, she does not get an absolute or alienable interest in such property, unless such power isexpressly conferred upon her. The reasoning adopted by Mitter J. of the Calcutta High Court in Mst. Kollani Kuar v.Luchmi Kuar(4), which was approved of and accepted by the Judicial Committee in a number of decisions, seemsto me to be unassailable. It was held by the Privy Council as early as in the case of Tagore V.Tagire (5) that if an estate were given to a man without express words of inheritance, it would, in the absence of aconﬂicting context, carry, by Hindu Law, an estate of inheritance. This is the general principle of law which isrecognized and embodied in section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act and unless it is shown that under Hindu Lawa gift to a female means a limited gift or carries with it the restrictions or disabilities similar to those that exist in a""widow's estate,' there is no justiﬁcation for departing from this principle. There is certainly no such provision inHindu Law and no text could be supplied in support of the same."" The position, therefore, is that to convey an absolute estate to a Hindu female, no express power (1) 21 A. 7. (4)24 W.R. 395.(2) (1947) I M.L.J. 64. (5) 9 Beng.

The learned Judges of the High Court were therefore clearly wrong in law in holding that the willhaving been made by the father in favour of his daughter, it should be presumed that he intended to give her alimited life estate.For the reasons given above we allow the appeal, set aside the decree of the High Court decreeing the plaintiﬀ 'ssuit and restore the decree of the trial Court dismissing the plaintiﬀ 's suit.

Badni, purporting to act in accordance with the directions of the oral will, executedand registered a deed of gift of the property in dispute in favour of Mst. Laxmi. The gift deed contains thefollowing recitals:- "" These houses are made a gift to you according to the will of your father, Ramchandra......... Inthis way, these houses belonging to us were purchased by your father, Ramchandra, and he in his last days havingmade a gift of these houses to you, made a will to us that he had made a gift of that house to his daughter, Laxmi,and directed us to get the gift deed registered in her name. He further said that if we or our relations., kinsmen,creditors do raise any dispute with her he would I damangir hoonga catch hold of him by his 53 garments.According to his aforesaid will, we have got this gift deed executed in your favour, while in best of our senses andin discharge of our sacred duty enjoined by Dharma...... No other person except you has got any claim over thehouse. You deal with your house in any way you like. If anybody takes back the land gifted by himself or hisancestors, he will live in hell as along as the sun and moon shines."" The scribe, it seems, did not in appropriatelanguage express the directions of the two widows and his ideas of the legal situation were somewhat confusedbut there can be no manner of doubt that the two executants were not conferring themselves any title which theyhad in the property on Laxmi but were merely giving eﬀect to the oral will as executors and were putting thelegatee in possession of the bequeathed property in this manner. That the widows had no title themselves isevident from the fact that Mst.Sheokori also joined in executing the gift deed. Admittedly Ramchandra's estate could not devolve on her.Bhuri, the second daughter, died in the year 1907, while Mst. Badni, the widow., died in the year 1927. Mst. Laxmiremained in possession of the property till her death in the year 1928. After her death Balabux, her husband, onthe 5th of July, 1930, claiming as heir to her mortgaged the house in dispute to the defendant appellant Nathoo Laland later on the 5th of October, 1933, he sold it to him and put him into possession of it and since then he is inpossession.On the 4th October, 1945, that is one day before the expiry of the period of 12 years from the date of thedefendant's entry into possession of the house, the plaintiﬀ, son of Mst. Bhuri, sister of Mst. Laxmi, claiming as anheir to her estate, ﬁled this suit in forma pauperis for possession of the house. He alleged that he was in possessionof the house till the 24th of August, 1933, through his tenant, that after it was vacated by the tenant he locked itand went away to his native village Harmara ; and that on the 27th of September, 1944, he came to know that thehouse had been taken possession of by the appellant during his absence. It 54 was contended by him that Balabuxhad no right either to mortgage or sell the house and that Laxmi was not the absolute owner of the property buthad only a limited estate in it, and on her death he was entitled to possession of it.On the 28th of August, 1947, the suit was dismissed by the Civil Judge, who held that Mst. Laxmi became theabsolute owner of the property, and the plaintiﬀ therefore had no title to claim possession of it after her death,Balabux being her stridhan heir. The learned Judge however held that the suit was within limitation. On appeal,this decision was aﬃrmed by the District Judge. He expressed the opinion that the widow in executing the deed ofgift was only acting as an execution of the oral will made by Ramchandra at his deathbed and that Laxmi got underthis will an absolute estate in the suit property. The plea of limitation raised by the defendant was negatived onthe ﬁnding that the plaintiﬀ was in possession of it within twelve years of the suit.Plaintiﬀ preferred a second appeal to the High Court of Jaipur and this time with success. The High Court held thatafter the death of Laxmi the plaintiﬀ continued in possession of the house till he was dispossessed by thedefendant on the 5th of October, 1933, and that he was in possession even during her lifetime. On the mainquestion in the case the High Court held that though the house was bequeathed to Laxmi by Ram chandra underan oral will, there was no proof that it conferred upon her an absolute interest in the property and that in theabsence of any evidence indicating that the donor intended to convey an absolute interest to her, the gift being infavour of a female could only confer upon her a limited life estate and on her death revert to the donor's heirs andthe plaintiﬀ being such an heir was entitled to succeed. In the result the appeal was allowed and the plaintiﬀ 's suitwas decreed with costs throughout.The defendant applied for a review of this judgment.Meanwhile the Jaipur High Court had become defunct and the review was heard by the Rajasthan High Court 55 assuccessor to the Jaipur High Court under the High Courts Ordinance and was partially allowed on the 5th of April,iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/40./9595595i95www.liiaase95html25 9/12/ 2020NATHOO LAL V. DURGA PRASAD [14] INSC 40; AIR 14 SC 35; 15 SCR 51 (9 Aprl 14)1950, and the decree was accordingly amended and it was provided therein that the plaintiﬀ shall not be entitledto possession of the house except on payment of Rs. 4,000 to the defendant as costs of improvements and repairs.It is against this judgment and decree passed after the coming into force of the Constitution of India that thepresent appeal has been preferred to this Court by leave of the Rajasthan High Court under article 133(1)(c) of theConstitution.The learned counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the appeal. Hecontended that according to the Code of Civil Procedure of the Jaipur State the decision of the Jaipur High Courthad become ﬁnal as no appeal lay from it and hence this appeal was incompetent. It was argued that theproceedings in the suit decided in 1945 had concluded by the decision of the High Court given in 1949, and thereview judgment which modiﬁed the decree in regard to improvements, could not entitle the appellant to reopenthe decision of the High Court of Jaipur given in 1949.In our opinion, this objection is not well founded. The only operative decree in the suit which ﬁnally andconclusively determines the rights of the parties is the decree passed on the 5th of April, 1950, by the RajasthanHigh Court and that having been passed after the coming into force of the Constitution of India, the provisions ofarticle 133 are attracted to it and it is appealable to this Court provided the requirements of that article are fulﬁlled.The Code of Civil Procedure of the Jaipur State could not determine the jurisdiction of this Court and has norelevancy to the maintainability of the appeal. The requirements of article 133 having been fulﬁlled, this appeal isclearly competent.The learned counsel then contended that the High Court was in error in granting the certiﬁcate in this case. We areunable to agree. An inquiry was made into the valuation of the property and it was reported that its value was Rs.20,000 or that the decision aﬀected 56 property of the value of above Rs. 20,000. A substantial question of law wasinvolved in the case, that is, whether a testamentary disposition by a Hindu in favour of a female' heir conferred onher only a limited estate in the absence of evidence that he intended to confer on her an absolute interest in theproperty. In these circumstances the High Court was fully justiﬁed in granting the certiﬁcate. We ourselves wouldhave been prepared to admit this appeal under our extraordinary powers conferred by article 136(1) of theConstitution, if such a certiﬁcate had not been given in the case. For the reasons given above we see no force ineither of these two preliminary objections which we overrule.Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand for the appellant contended that the Courts below were in error in holding that the plaintiﬀ 'ssuit was within limitation. He urged that in order to bring the suit within limitation the plaintiﬀ in paragraph 5 ofthe plaint alleged that after the death of Laxmi he kept tenants in the house, realised the rent and enjoyed itand/that the last tenant vacated on the 24th August, 1933, and thereafter he went to his native place after lockingthe house, but that this allegation had not been made good by him, and as there was no evidence that he lookedthe house, it should be held that plaintiﬀ 's possession discontinued with eﬀect from the 24th August, 1933, andhence his suit brought more than twelve years-from that date was not within time.It has been found by the Courts below that the plaintiﬀ was in possession of this house even during the lifetime ofLaxmi and continued in possession thereafter. Even if the tenant vacated the house on the 24th August, 1933, andthe plaintiﬀ did not lock it, his possession would be presumed to continue till he was dispossessed by some one.The law presumes in favour of continuity of possession. The three Courts below have unanimously held that on theevidence it was established that after the death of Laxmi plaintiﬀ continued in possession of the house and the suitwas within limitation. There are no valid grounds for reviewing this ﬁnding in the fourth Court and the contentionis therefore negatived.57 Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand next contended that Laxmi acquired an absolute title in the suit property under the will ofher father and that the High Court was in error in@holding that unless there were express words indicating thatthe donor who had absolute interest in the gifted property intended to convey an absolute interest to her, the giftin favour of an heir who would ordinarily inherit a limited interest could not be construed as conferring an absoluteinterest. The learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand raised two contentions. He urged in the ﬁrstinstance that it seems that the intention of Ramchandra was to make a gift of the suit property in favour of Laxmibut he was unable to perfect the gift by executing a registered deed, being on his deathbed and in that situationthe property devolved on his widow by inheritance and it only came to Laxmi under the widow's gift and under itshe could not get a larger interest than what the widow herself possessed, namely, a limited life estate, whichterminated on her death. In the alternative, it was said that there was no evidence as to the terms of the oral williofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/40./9595595i95www.liiaase95html35 9/12/ 2020NATHOO LAL V. DURGA PRASAD [14] INSC 40; AIR 14 SC 35; 15 SCR 51 (9 Aprl 14)and that 'being so, the gift being in favour of a female heir, the presumption in the absence of evidence to thecontrary was that the donee got only a limited life interest in the bequeathed property.In our judgment, there is force in the contention of Dr. Tek Chand and none of the contentions raised by therespondent's 'counsel have any validity. That Ramchandra bequeathed the suit property and did not gift it to hisdaughter Laxmi is a fact which cannot be questioned at this stage. It was admitted by the plaintiﬀ himself in thewitness box. This is what he said"

"" This notice furnishes a true guide as to the intention of theplaintiﬀ which was none other than that he should run the liquor shops exclusively for himself and appropriate theproﬁ ts thereof without making himself accountable to his brothers. Although the plaintiﬀ says that he intended topay for the auction of liquor shops by borrowing he was really in a position of vantage for he admittedly had Rs.13,0 00 cash in hand as 105 against the Rs. 3,0 00 his brothers had. The notice explains the signiﬁ cance of theprovision in the compromise that accounts are to be taken only up to March 31, 1 946. Since the plaintiﬀ did notwant his brothers to interfere with his exclusive running of the liquor business after March 31, 1 946, he perforcehad to agree that he should sever his connection with other businesses run by his brothers. This arrangement wasapparently acceptable to all the brothers as being fair and reasonable and as not giving undue advantage to anyparty over the other. This being our construction of the compromise, it follows that the plaintiﬀ 's conduct in goingback upon that arrangement by ﬁ ling a fresh suit in regard to the motor business only is anything but honest.The plaint ﬁ led in the previous suit leaves no manner of doubt that the plaintiﬀs in that suit ,s ought a completedivision of all the family property both movable and immovable and a ﬁ nal determination of all the accounts inrespect of the family businesses. It is also signiﬁ cant that after the compromise the plaintiﬀ (Balkrishna) ﬁ led anapplication before the Civil Judge in which he alleged that when he agreed in the compromise that the accounts ofthe various businesses should be up to the 31st March, 1 946, he was under a misapprehension regarding his legal.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/41.h/020SITONTKKRISHITONTKR95NS95595wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml35- 9/12/2HANKAR SARA M SAKE & ANR V.

He goes on to say that he laboured under the impressionthat the joint family business would be either altogether stopped after the 31st March, 1 946, o r would be runeither by the arbitrators or the Commissioners and the proﬁ ts accruing therefrom would be deposited in Court fordistribution among the parties according to their shares. The application was made on November 22, 1 947. Hispleader, ho wever, s tated on April 6, 1 948: "" The application is abandoned by the applicant as he wishes to pursuehis remedy by way of an independent suit for the grievance in the application,"" and the Court passed the order,""The application is disposed of as 14 106 it is not pressed. "" The learned Judges of the High Court in referring to thisapplication observe thus: "" It is obvious therefrom that really speaking the idea of the proﬁ ts of several businessesafter the 1st of April, 1 946, w as present to the minds of the parties; but the parties did not care to ask thataccounts of the other businesses will be taken up after the 1st of April, 1 946. One of the businesses was a liquorbusiness, w hich admittedly was to come to an end on the 31st of March, 1946; but there was also anotherbusiness; that Was a kirana shop, w hich was not a very big business. But all the same it was there, and there isforce, t herefore, in t he contention which has been advanced on behalf of the appellants that it was not as if therehas been an oversight on the part of the parties, but the parties knew that the businesses might go on afterwards;but if they were carried on, t hey did not particularly care for providing by the compromise decree for accounts ofthose businesses being taken after the 1st of April, 1 946. "" Having said all this they record the conclusion that thecompromise did not expressly negative the right of the plaintiﬀ to an account of motor business. We are unable toaccept this conclusion. The observations quoted above negative the plaintiﬀ 's case about mistake ormisunderstanding in regard to the true eﬀect of the compromise and show that the plaintiﬀ abandoned the rightto Account after the crucial date and the status of the parties thereafter changed into one of tenants in common. Ifthe plaintiﬀ really intended that accounts of the motor business or indeed of all other businesses were to be takenup to the date of the 'ﬁ nal decree, there was no point in mentioning the 31st March, 1 946. The normal course, a fterthe preliminary decree was passed by the Court, w as to divide all the property by metes and bounds and to awardmonies as found on examination of the accounts right up to the date of the ﬁ nal decree . But for the compromisewhich limited the period of the account the plaintiﬀ would have obtained the relief he is now seeking, in thepartition suit as accounts would have been taken of all the businesses up to the date of the ﬁ nal decree. Theplaintiﬀ has himself to thank for preventing the natural 107 course of events and for forbidding the accounts to betaken after the 31st March, 1 946. The plaintiﬀ on the other hand has no real grievance in the matter, for althoughthe defendants Nos. 1 and 2, w ho continued to run the motor business, m ay have made some money with the-help of the two old motor buses, t he plaintiﬀ whose keenness to run the liquor business is apparent from thenotice referred to above was not precluded from reaping the fruits of that business. It is hard to conceive that theplaintiﬀ would have agreed to share his burden of the loss if the motor business had sustained any. We hold,therefore, that the compromise closed once for all the controversy about taking any account of the joint familybusinesses including the motor business after the 31st March', 1946, and the plaintiﬀ is bound by the terms of thecompromise and the consent decree following upon it.The obvious eﬀect of this ﬁ nding is that the plaintiﬀ is barred by the principle of res judicata from reaitating thequestion in the present suit. It is well settled that a consent decree is as binding upon the parties thereto as adecree passed by invitum. The compromise having been found not to be vitiated by fraud, misrepresentation,misunderstanding or mistake, t he decree passed thereon has the binding force of res judicata.We are also of opinion that the plaintiﬀ 's claim is barred by the provisions of Order II, r ule 2(3), o f the Code of CivilProcedure. The plaintiﬀ by conﬁ ning his claim to account up to March 3, 1 946, only, implicitly of not explicitly,relinquished his claim to the account for the subsequent period. Sub- rule 3 clearly lays down that if a personOmits, e xcept with the leave of the Court, t o sue for all reliefs to which he is entitled, he shall not afterwards suefor any relief so omitted. We do not agree with the High Court that the cause of action in the subsequent suit wasdiﬀerent from the cause of action in the ﬁ rst suit.The cause of action in the ﬁ rst suit was the desire of the plaintiﬀ to separate from his brothers and to divide thejoint family property. That suit embraced the entire property without any reservation and was compromised, theplaintiﬀ having abandoned his claim to account in respect of 108 the motor business subsequent to March 31,1946. His subsequent suit to enforce a part of the claim is founded on the same cause of action which hedeliberately relinquished.We are clear, t herefore, t hat the cause of action in the two suits being the same, t he suit is barred under Order II,rule 2(3), o f the Civil Procedure Code..la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/41.h/020SITONTKKRISHITONTKR95NS95595wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml45 9/12/2HANKAR SARA M SAKE & ANR V.

BALNA SARAM SAKE & OS [14] IC 41; AIR 14 SC 32; 15 …The appeal arises out of a partition between 6 brothers of a joint Hindu family. The joint family carried on jointfamily business of a grocery shop, liq uor shops, a ration shop, a motor- bus service and also moneylending underthe name of ""Sontakke Brothers"". The family also Possessed immovable and movable property. Balkrishna SitaramSontakke is the eldest of the brothers and is the plaintiﬀ respondent in the present appeal. He will be referred tohereafter as the plain- tiﬀ.It is common ground that up to 1944 the brothers were living and messing together and the income from 101 thefamily business used to be kept with the plaintiﬀ.From April 14, 1 945, t he situation changed and the parties began to appropriate the proceeds of the variousbusinesses carried on by them separately to themselves. The plaintiﬀ was running the liquor shops, d efendantsNos. I and 2 who are the appellants, w ere carrying on the motor- bus service business while defendant No. 4 wasrunning the grocery shop.The parties tried to have partition eﬀected between them through arbitrators but the attempt failed. On June 29,1945, all the ﬁ ve brothers ﬁ led a suit for partition against the plaintiﬀ of all joint family properties including theaccounts of all the businesses. The suit was numbered 39 of 1945. It was compromised on March 7, 1946.By this compromise it was declared that prior to 1942 all the accounts of the various businesses had been correctlymaintained and shown, t hat the parties had agreed to have arbitrators appointed through Court for examining theaccounts from 1942 up to March 31, 1 946, a nd for determining the amount due up to that date . Each of thebrothers was to get one - sixth share in the cash balance as found on March 31, 1946, up on examination of accountsby the arbitrators.All the movable property of the joint family including the stock-in- trade of all the family businesses was to bedivided equally among all the brothers. The compromise further declared that the plaintiﬀ was to have one- sixthshare in the motor garage and that defendants 1 and 2 were to pay the price of one- sixth share to him. These arethe material provisions of the compromise. One of the brothers was a minor and the Court ﬁ nding the compromiseto be for the beneﬁ t of the minor accepted it and passed a pre- liminary decree in terms of the compromise on July25, 1 947.If nothing else had happened to disturb the natural course of events, the proceedings would have ended in a ﬁ naldecree for partition. The plaintiﬀ, ho wever, c ommenced a fresh suit on February 23, 1 949, c onﬁ ning his relief to hisshare of the proﬁ ts and assets Of the motor business carried on by defendants Nos. 1 and 2 after March 31,1 946.His case was that the compromise was made in a hurry, t hat the parties omitted to provide in the compromiseabout the future conduct 102 of the motor business from April 1, 1 946, t hat the motor business was still a jointfamily business and that he had a right to ask for accounts of that business subsequent to March 31, 1 946.In defence it was pleaded that the compromise was made after due deliberation, t hat accounts of the motor'business and grocery shop should actually have been taken up to April 14, 1 945, t he date of disruption of the jointfamily status, b ut the parties agreed by way of compromise that account of all family businesses should be takenup to March 31, 1 946. It was also pleaded that the claim was barred by res judicata.Upon the issues framed in the case the Civil Judge found that the suit was not. barred by reason of the decision inthe previous suit No. 39 of 1945, t hat the decision in that suit was not obtained by fraud and misrepresentation andthat the compromise in the previous suit was not due to a mistake or misunderstanding. Despite these ﬁ ndings theCivil Judge held that although the motor business carried on after the partition had ceased to be a joint familybusiness yet as it was carried on by some members of a family their position was analogous to that of a partnercarrying on partnership after dissolution and applying the principle underlying section 37 of the Partnership Act heheld that the two brothers carrying on the motor business were liable to account. Accordingly he passed apreliminary decree directing the accounts of the motor business to be taken from March 31, 1 946, up to the dateon which a ﬁ nal decree for payment of the amount found to be due would be made . A Commissioner wasappointed to take the accounts to ascertain the proﬁ ts earned by the use of the capital belonging to the shares ofbrothers other than those who carried on the motor business. In appeal Bavdekar 'J. with whom Dixit J.agreed modiﬁ ed the decree of the trial Court by directing that the accounts were to be taken up to the date whenthe businesses discontinued and not up to the date of the ﬁ nal decree..la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/14/41.h/020SITONTKKRISHITONTKR95NS95595wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml25 9/12/2HANKAR SARA M SAKE & ANR V. BALNA SARAM SAKE & OS [14] IC 41; AIR 14 SC 32; 15 …The learned Judges held that the cause of action for the present suit was diﬀerent from the cause . of action in theprevious suit and that the suit was not barred 103 by res judicata or by Order II, r ule 2, o f the Code of CivilProcedure. After delivering themselves of some conﬂ icting observations to which reference will in detail be madehereafter they held that the consent decree did not expressly negative the right for accounts of the motortransport business. Finally the learned Judges recorded the conclusion that regardless of the pleadings in the casethe defendants Nos. I and 2 had made use of the joint family property and that they stood in, t he position of co-owners and as contemplated in section 90 of the Indian Trusts Act were liable to render accounts for the- proﬁ tswhich were attributable to the employment of the assets owned by the parties jointly.Learned counsel for the appellants has contested the view of the High Court upon all the points decided, ,a gainstthem.He has contended that the cause of action in a suit for partition is the desire and intention of the family toseparate, that the cause of action in the two suits is identically the same and not separate and distinct and . thatthe suit was, t herefore, b arred both by the principle of res judicata and by Order II, r ule 2, o f the Civil ProcedureCode. Learned counsel also challenged the view of the High Court about the applicability of section 90 of theIndian Trusts Act It seems to us that upon a fair reading of the compromise arrived at between the parties in thecircumstances then existing, the only legitimate conclusion possible is that the parties had agreed to conﬁ ne thetaking of all accounts upto March 31,1 946, a nd had closed the door to reopening them beyond that date. If thecompromise was arrived at after full consideration by the parties and was not vitiated by fraud , m isrepresentation,mistake or misunderstanding as held by the trial Court- a ﬁ nding which was not interfered with by the High Court-itfollows that a matter once concluded between the parties who were dealing with each other at arms length cannotnow be reopened. What led the parties to conﬁ ne the period of account to March 31, 1946, a nd stop furtheraccounting which would have normally extended to the passing of the ﬁ nal decree will appear from the followingcircumstances. The plaintiﬀ knew that the licence for the liquor shops 104 carried on by him was expiring on the1st April, 1 946, and he was anxious to run the liquor business exclusively and not jointly or in partnership with hisbrothers after the expiry of the licence. He gave a notice to his brothers through pleader on December 12, 1 945,stating inter alia the following"

The numerous decisions of the High Courts on the point are of no helpbecause two documents are seldom expressed in identical terms.The intention of the parties is the determining factor but the intention must be gathered from the document itselfwhich has to be construed to ﬁnd out the legal eﬀect of the words used by the parties. If the words are express andclear, eﬀect must 'be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or in. tended is ruled out.If however there is ambiguity in the language employed then it is permissible to look to the surroundingcircumstances to determine what was intended.175 In view of the provisions of the amended section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act, if the sale andagreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents, then the transaction cannot be a mortgagewhether the documents are contemporaneously executed or not. But the mere fact that there is only onedocument does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and, cannot be a sale.

SHEIKH EBADAT ALI & ANR [14] INSC 42; AIR 14 SC 35; 15 S CR 14 (14 Ap rl 14)""The rule of law on this subject is one dictated by commonsense; that prima facie an absolute conveyance,containing nothing to show that the relation of debtor and creditor is to exist between the parties, does not ceaseto be an absolute conveyance and become a mortgage merely because the vendor stipulates that he shall have aright to repurchase............... In every such case the question is, what, upon a fair construction, is the meaning ofthe instruments? Their Lord-ships of the Privy Council applied this rule to India in Bhagwan Sahai v. Bhagwan Din(3) and in Jhanda Singh v. Wahid-ud-din (4).The converse also holds good and if, on the face of it, an instrument clearly purports to be a mortgage it cannot beturned into a sale by reference to a host of (1) 27 I.A. 58.

Diﬃculty only arises in the border line cases where there isambiguity.Unfortunately, they form the bulk of this kind of transaction.Because of the welter of confusion caused by a multitude of conﬂicting decisions the Legislature stepped in andamended section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act.Unfortunately that brought in its train a further conﬂict of authority. But this much is now clear. If the sale andagreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents, then the transaction cannot be a mortgagewhether the documents are, contemporaneously executed or not. But the converse does not hold good, that is tosay, the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage andcannot be a sale. If the condition of repurchase is embodied in the document that eﬀects or purports to eﬀect the -sale, then it is a matter for construction which was meant. The Legislature has made a clear cut classiﬁcation andexcluded transactions embodied in more than one document from the category of mortgages, therefore it isreasonable to suppose that persons who, after the amendment, choose not to use two documents, do not intendthe transaction to be a sale, unless they displace that presumption by clear and express words; and if theconditions of section 58(c) are fulﬁlled, then we are of opinion that the deed should be construed as a mortgage.The document with which we are concerned, Exhibit A, is in the following terms and our ﬁrst duty is to construethe language used and see whether it is ambiguous. (We have paragraphed the document for convenience ofconstruction and have omitted unnecessary words).(1)"" Rs. 634 principal with interest under a registered rehan bond "" (simple mortgage) "" dated the 6th May, 1927, isjustly due............ by us the executants.

(10) "" Therefore we, the executants......... have executed this deed of conditional sale so that itmay be of use in future."" In our opinion, this language is not free from diﬃculty and is ambiguous. The deedpurports to be a sale and has the outward form of one but at the same time it calls itself a""conditional sale."" Ithas,however, no clause for retransfer and instead says (clause 6) that if the executants pay the money within twoyeas, the property "" shall come in exclusive possession and occupation of us, the executants."" That is clear aboutthe possession but is silent about the title. In the context we can only take these words to mean that if there ispayment within the speciﬁed time, then the title will continue to reside in the executants; for what else can a rightof exclusive possession import in these circumstances ? It is relevant to note in passing that this silence about titlewould be proper in a mortgage for there the owner's title remains in him all the while and so a reconveyance isunnecessary. But if there is an out and out sale the title could not revert to the original owner without a properreconveyance. Clause (7) appears to underline this because it couples the transferee's; right to remain inpossession and occupation and to appropriate the produce "" generation after generation "" with the non-paymentof the money within the time set out. It is true the words of conveyance in the earlier part Of the deed (clause 5)would pass an absolute title if they stood alone but the document must be read as a whole and it must also beremembered that it was executed by ignorant justice and scribed by a man whose knowledge of conveyancingwas, on the face of it, rudimentary and defective. The deed lacks the precision of a practised hand and thatprobably accounts. for its ambiguities: that there is ambiguity is patent from what we have said.181 The next step is to see whether the document is covered by section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act, for- ifit is not, then it cannot be a mortgage by conditional sale. The ﬁrst point there is to see whether there is an ""ostensible sale."" That means a transaction which takes the outward form of a sale, for the essence of a mortgageby conditional sale is that though in substance it is a mortgage it is couched in the form of a sale with certainconditions attached. The executable clearly purported to sell the property in clause (5) because they say so,therefore, if the transaction is not in substance a mortgage, it is unquestionably a sale: an actual sale and notmerely an ostensible one. But if it is a mortgage, then the condition about an "" ostensible sale "" is fulﬁlled.We next turn to the conditions. The ones relevant to the present purpose are contained in clauses (6) and (7). Bothare ambiguous, but we have already said that on a fair construction clause (6) means that if the money is paidwithin the two years then the possession will revert to the executants with the result that the title which is alreadyin them will continue to reside there. The necessary consequence of that is that the ostensible sale becomes void.Similarly, clause- (7), though clumsily worded, can only mean that if the money is not paid, then the sale shallbecome absolute. Those are not the actual words used but, in our opinion, that is a fair construction of theirmeaning when the document is read as a whole. If that is what they mean, as we hold they do, then the matterfalls squarely within the ambit of section 58(c).Now, as we have already said, once a transaction is embodied in One document and not two and once its terms arecovered by section 58(c) then it must be taken to be a mortgage by conditional sale unless there are express wordsto indicate the contrary, or, in a case of ambiguity, the attendant circumstances necessarily lead to the oppositeconclusion.There are no express words here which say that this is not a mortgage but there is ambiguity, so we must probefurther.The respondents, who claim that this 182 is a sale and not a mortgage, rely on the following circumstances. Theyare all culled from the deed itself First, they point to clause (5) which says that the transferee has been made theabsolute proprietor in place of the executants. Those, they say, are the operative words and point to an out andout transfer of title. Next, they point to clause (2) where the executants say that they have no other Means ofraising the money they want except by selling the property. The respondents argue that the word "" sale "" could nothave been used inadvertently because it is contrasted with a mortgage in the very same sentence. The word ""mortgage ""is also used in clause (1), therefore it is clear that when a mortgage is intended the word "" mortgage isused. It must follow that when the word "" sale is used, a sale must have been meant. The only weakness in thisargument is that when a mortgage is by conditional sale this is the form it has to take, because section 58(c)postulates that there must be an "" ostensible sale "" and if a sale is ostensible it must necessarily contain all theoutward indicate of a real sale. The question we are considering can only arise when the word "" sale "" is used and,of course, a sale imports a transfer of title. The use of the words It absolute proprietor in our places "" carries thematter no further because the essence of every sale is to make the vendee the absolute proprietor of what is sold.The question here is not whether the words purport to make the transferee, an absolute proprietor, for of coursethey must under section 58(c), but whether that is done "" ostensibly "" and whether conditions of a certain kind are.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/42. h/02095954957i95wwwiiase95tml46 9/12/2PANDIT CHUNCHUN JHA V. SHEIKH EBADAT ALI & ANR [14] INSC 42; AIR 14 SC 35; 15 S CR 14 (14 Ap rl 14)attached.The learned counsel for the respondents next relied on the fact that clause (3) says that the price paid was a ""fairand just?' one and that the Courts below have found that the consideration was not inadequate. , He also relies onthe fact that no interest was charged, that the transferee was placed in possession of the property and was Dot toaccount- for the usufruct also on the fact that a short term, namely two years, was ﬁxed for repayment.183 But on the other side, there is the very signiﬁcant fact that Rs. 65-6-0 was borrowed to enable the executantsto carry on commutation proceedings under section 40 of the Bihar Tenancy Act (that is, for substitution of a cashrent instead of one in kind) in respect of this very property:(clause 1). It was admitted before us, and the lower Courts so ﬁnd, that the commutation proceedings related tothis very land. The learned High Court Judges discount this by saying that there is no evidence to show that theproceedings, which were started in 1929, continued after the deed. But that is a mistake apparently due to the factthat the copy of the entry in the Rent Schedule, produced before the learned Judges, inadvertently omitted thedate. Mr. N.C. Chatterjee produced a certiﬁed copy of the revenue record here and that gives the missing date. From that it isclear that the proceedings continued till 18th February,- 1931, that is to say, for some ten months after the deed.This, we think, is crucial. Persons who are selling their property would hardly take the trouble to borrow money inorder to continue revenue proceedings which could no longer beneﬁt them and could only enure for the good oftheir transferees.There is another point in favour of the appellant, and that is that the surrounding circumstances show that therewas a relationship of debtor and creditor between the. parties existing at the date of the suit transaction. The bulkof the consideration went in satisfaction of the mortgage of 6th May, 1927. In those circumstances, seeing that thedeed takes the form of a mortgage by conditional sale under section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act, it islegitimate to infer, in the absence of clear indications to the contrary, that the relationship of debtor and creditorwas intended to continue.The point made on behalf of the respondents about the adequacy of the consideration and the absence of interestcan be explained. The transferee was to take possession of the property and would thus get the produce and it isevident to us from the tenor of the document that he was not to be accountable for it.184 We say this because the indemnity clause (clause 9) says in sub-clause (b) that in the event of the transferee'spossession being disturbed the executants would among other things, pay him, in addition to damages, the entireconsideration together with interest at 2 per cent. per month from the date of the deed and would not require thetransferee to account for the usufruct. It is true this can also be read the other way but considering these verydrastic provisions as also the threat of a criminal prosecution in sub-clause (a), we think the transferee was out toexact more than his pound of ﬂesh from the unfortunate rustics with whom he was dealing and that he would nothave agreed to account for the proﬁts: indeed that is his own case, for he says that this was a sale out and out. Inthese circumstances, there would be no need to keep a reasonable margin between the debt and the value of theproperty as is ordinarily done in the case of a mortgage. Taking everything into consideration, we are of opinionthat the deed is a mortgage by conditional sale under section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act.The appeal is allowed. The decree of the High Court is set aside and that of the lower appellate Court is restoredexcept as to costs.The original owners of the property have lost it. The value of the property was put at over Rs. 10,000 in the specialleave petition. The second defendant oust,.,, the original owners by getting a mortgage decree for Rs. 130 in hisfavour on a mortgage of only Rs. 25 and purchasing it at the auction himself. He is no longer in the picture as hesold it to the plaintiﬀ for Rs. 400. The plaintiﬀ has accordingly obtained property which on his own showing isworth more than Rs. 10,000 for only Rs. 400. The ﬁrst defendant spent only Rs. 250 plus Rs. 65-6-0 on it: Rs. 315- 6-0 and the consideration of the disputed deed is only Rs.700. it is evident that both sides are speculators. In the circumstances we direct that each party bear its own costs.Civil Appeal No. 98 of 1953.Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Decree dated the 27th day of January, 1949, of the High Court ofJudicature at Patna in Appeal from Appellate Decree No. 690 of 1947 against the Decree dated the 13th January,1947, of the Court of the District Judge, Bbagalpur, in Title Appeal No. 161 of 1946 arising out of the Judgment and.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/42. h/02095954957i95wwwiiase95tml16 9/12/2PANDIT CHUNCHUN JHA V.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This is a plaintiﬀ 's appeal in a suit for re-demption of what the plaintiﬀ calls a mortgage dated 15th April, 1930. The only question for determination iswhether this is a mortgage by conditional sale or a sale out and out with a condition of repurchase. If the formerthe plaintiﬀ succeeds. If the latter he is out of Court.The property covered by the disputed deed belonged to one Bijai Tanti who died leaving a widow Mst. Phaguniand two sons Siban Tanti and Chander Tanti. On 25th May, 1922, Siban Tanti alone executed a 176 simplemortgage in favour of the second defendant for Rs.25. Then on 6th May, 1927, Siban Tanti, Chander Tanti and Mst. Phaguni mortgaged the same property to the ﬁrstdefendant for Rs. 250. This was also a simple mortgage.After this came the transaction in suit dated 15th April, 1930. The same three persons executed the disputed deed.This was in favour of the ﬁrst defendant. The consideration mentioned in the deed is Rs. 634-10-0 due on thesecond mortgage and Rs. 65-6-0 taken in cash to enable the executants to meet the expenses of certaincommutation proceedings under section 40 of the Bihar Tenancy Act in respect of this very land.The second defendant sued on his mortgage of 1922 but did:not join the subsequent mortgagee, the ﬁrst defendant. He obtained a decree against the mortgagors alone andexecuted it in 1940. He himself purchased the property in dispute and took possession on 20th March, 1943.Shortly-after, on 19th August, 1943, he sold this land to the plaintiﬀ for Rs. 400.The plaintiﬀ 's title is derived from the second defendant who stepped into the shoes of the mortgagors because ofhis suit against the mortgagors in 1940. The plaintiﬀ 's case is that the transaction of 15th April, 1930, is a mortgageand, as the subsequent mortgagee was not joined as a party to the earlier suit, the plaintiﬀ is entitled to redeem.The ﬁrst defendant's case is that the transaction of 15th April, 1930, was not a mortgage but an out and out salewith a covenant for repurchase which became infructuous because no attempt was made to act on the covenantwithin the time speciﬁed. The learned trial Judge and the lower appellate Court both held that the document was amortgage and so decreed the plaintiﬀ 's claim. The High Court on second appeal reversed these ﬁndings and held itwas a sale.Consequently the learned Judges dismissed the plaintiﬀ 's suit. The plaintiﬀ appeals here.The question whether a given transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale or a sale outright with a condition ofrepurchase is a vexed one which invariably gives rise to trouble and litigation. There are numerous 177 decisions onthe point and much industry has been expended in some of the High Courts in collating and analysing them.We think that is a fruitless task because two documents are seldom expressed in identical terms and when it isnecessary to consider the attendant circumstances the imponderable variables which that brings in its train makeit impossible to compare one case with another. Each must be decided on its own facts. But certain broadprinciples remain.The ﬁrst is that the intention of the parties is the determining factor: see Balkishen Das V. Legge (1). But there isnothing special about that in this class of cases and here, as in every other case where a document has to beconstrued the intention must be gathered, in the ﬁrst place, from the document itself. If the words are express andclear., eﬀect must be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or intended is ruled out.the real question in such a case is not what the parties intended or meant but what is the legal eﬀect of the wordswhich they used. If, however, there is ambiguity in the language employed, then it is permissible to look to thesurrounding circumstances to determine what was intended.As Lord Cranworth said in A Aderson v.

The policy of theLegislature has been to treat objections as to jurisdiction, both territorial and pecuniary, as technical and not opento consideration by an appellate Court, unless there has been prejudice on the merits.Mere change of form is not prejudice within the meaning of section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act; nor a mere errorin the decision on the merits of the case. It must be one directly attributable to over-valuation or under-valuation.Whether there has been prejudice or not is a matter to be determined on the facts of each case. The jurisdictionunder section 11 is an equitable one to be exercised, when there has been an erroneous assumption of jurisdictionby a Subordinate Court as a result of over-valuation or under- valuation and a consequential -failure of justice.

J. Title Appeal No. I of 1946 arising out of the Judgment andDecree dated the 27th November, 1945, of the First Court of Subordinate Judge at Monghyr in Title Suit No. 34 of1944.S.C. Issacs (Ganeshwar Prasad and R. C. Prasad, with him) for the appellants. B.K. Saran and M. M. Sinha forrespondents Nos. 1-9.1954. April 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This appeal raises aquestion on the construction of section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act. The appellants instituted the suit out ofwhich this appeal arises, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Monghyr, for recovery of possession of 12 acres 51cents of land situated in mauza Bardih, of which defendants Nos. 12 and 13, forming the second party, are theproprietors. The allegations in the plaint are that on 12th April, 1943, the plaintiﬀs were admitted by the secondparty as occupancy tenants on payment of a sum of Rs. 1,950 as salami and put into possession of the. lands, andthat thereafter, the ﬁrst party consisting of defendants Nos. 1 to 11 trespassed on them and carried away thecrops. The, suit was 119 accordingly laid for ejecting defendants Nos. I to II and for mesne proﬁts, past and future,and it was valued at Rs.2,950, made up of Rs. 1,950 being the value of the relief for possession and Rs. 1,000, being the past mesne proﬁtsclaimed.Defendants Nos.- I to II contested the suit. They pleaded that they had been in possession of the lands as tenantson batai system, sharing the produce with the landlord., from fasli 1336 and had acquired occupancy rights in thetenements, that the second party had no right to settle them on the plaintiﬀs, and that the latter acquired' norights under the settlement dated 12th April, 1943. Defendants Nos. 12 and 13 remained ex-parte.The Subordinate Judge held, relying on certain receipts marked as Exhibits A to A-114 which were in thehandwriting of the patwaris of the second party and which ranged over the period from fasli 1336 to 1347, thatdefendants Nos. I to II had been in possession for over 12 years as cultivating tenants and had acquired occupancyrights, and that the settlement dated 12th April,' 1943, conferred no rights on the plaintiﬀs. He accordinglydismissed the suit. The plaintiﬀs preferred an appeal against this decision to the Court of the District Judge.Monghyr, who agreed with the trial Court that the receipts, Exhibits A to A-114 were genuine, and that defendantsNos. I to 11 had acquired occupancy rights, and accordingly dismissed the appeal.The plaintiﬀs took up the matter in second appeal to the High Court, Patna, S.A. No. 1152 of 1946, and there, forthe ﬁrst time; an objection was taken by the Stamp Reporter to the valuation in the plaint and after enquiry, theCourt determined that the correct valuation of the suit was Rs.9,980. The plaintiﬀs paid the additional Court-fees required of them, and then raised the contention that on therevised valuation, the appeal from the decree of the Subordinater Judge would lie not to the District Court but tothe High Court, and that accordingly S. A. No. 1152 of 1946 should be heard as a ﬁrst appeal, ignoring thejudgment of the District Court. The learned Judges held following the decision 120 of a Full -Bench of that Court inRamdeo Singh v. Raj Narain (1), that the appeal to the District Court was competent, and that its decision could bereversed only if the appellants could establish prejudice on the merits, and holding that on a consideration of theevidence no such prejudice had been shown, they dismissed the second appeal.The matter now comes before us on special leave.It will be noticed that the proper Court to try the present action would be the Subordinate Court, Monghyr,whether the valuation of the suit was Rs. 2,950 as given in the plaint, or Rs. 9,880 as determined by the High Court;but it will make a diﬀerence in the forum to which the appeal from its judgment would lie, whether the onevaluation or the other is to be accepted as the deciding factor. On the plaint valuation, the appeal would lie to theDistrict Court; on the valuation as determined by the High Court, it is that Court that would be competent toentertain the appeal. The contention of the appellants is that as on the valuation of the suit as ultimatelydetermined, the District Court was not competent to entertain the appeal, the decree and judgment passed bythat Court must be treated as a nullity, that the High Court should have accordingly heard S.A.

CHAMAN P ASWAN & ORS [14] INSC 43; AIR 14 SC 30; 15 SCR 17 (14 Aprl 14)1152 of 1946 not as a second appeal with its limitations under section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code but as a ﬁrstappeal against the judgment and decree of the Subordinate Judge, Monghyr, and that the appellants were entitledto a full heating as well on questions of fact as of law. And alternatively, it is contended that even if the decree andjudgment of the District Court on appeal are not to be treated as a nullity and the matter is to be dealt with undersection 11 of the Suits Valuation Act, the appellants had suﬀered ""Prejudice"" within the meaning of that section, inthat their appeal against the judgment of the Subordinate Judge was heard not by the High Court but by a Court ofinferior jurisdiction, viz., the District Court of Monghyr, and that its decree was therefore liable to be set aside, andthe appeal heard by the High Court on the merits, as a ﬁrst appeal.(1) I.L.R. 27 Patna 109; A.I.R. 1949 Patna 278, 121 The answer to these contentions must depend on what theposition in law is when a Court entertains a suit or an appeal over which it has no jurisdiction, and what the eﬀectof section II of the Suits Valuation Act is on that position. It is a fundamental principle well established that adecree passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever andwherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateralproceedings. A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the Court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot becured even by consent of parties. If the question now under consideration fell to be' determined only on theapplication of general principles governing the matter, there can be no doubt that the District Court of Monghyrwas coram non judice, and that its judgment and decree would be nullities.The question is what is the eﬀect of section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act on this position.Section 11 enacts that notwithstanding anything in section 578 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an objection that aCourt which had 'no jurisdiction over a suit or appeal had exercised it by reason of over-valuation or under-valuation, should not be entertained by an appellate Court., except as provided in the section. Then followprovisions as to when the objections could be entertained, and how they are to be dealt with. The drafting of thesection has come in-and deservedlyfor considerable criticism; but amidst much that is obscure and confused, thereis one principle which stands out clear and conspicuous. It is that a decree passed by a Court, which would havehad no jurisdiction to hear a suit or appeal but for over-valuation or under-valuation, is not to be treated as, what itwould be but for the section, null and void, and that an objection to jurisdiction based on over-valuation orundervaluation should be dealt with under that section and not otherwise. The reference to section 578, nowsection 99, of the Civil Procedure Code, in the opening words of the section is signiﬁcant. That section, whileproviding that no decree shall be reversed or varied in 16 122 appeal on account of the defects mentioned thereinwhen they do not aﬀect the merits of the case, excepts from its operation defects of jurisdiction. Section 99therefore gives no protection to decrees passed on merits, when the Courts which passed them lacked jurisdictionas a result of over-valuation or undervaluation. It is with a view to avoid this result that section 11 was enacted. Itprovides that objections to the jurisdiction of a Court based on over-valuation or under-valuation shall Dot beentertained by an appellate Court except in the manner and to the extent mentioned in the section. It is a self-contained provision complete in itself, and no objection to jurisdiction based on over-valuation or under-valuationcan be raised otherwise than in accordance with it. With reference to objections relating to territorial jurisdiction,section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code enacts that no objection to the place of suing should be allowed by anappellate or revisional Court, unless there was a consequent failure of justice. It is the same principle that has beenadopted in section 1 1 of the Suits Valuation Act with reference to pecuniary jurisdiction. The policy underlyingsections 21 and 99 of the Civil Procedure Code and section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act is the same, namely, thatwhen a case had been tried by a Court on the merits and judgment rendered, it should not be liable to be reversedpurely on technical grounds, unless it had resulted in failure of justice, and the policy of the Legislature has been totreat objections to jurisdiction both territorial and pecuniary as technical and not open to consideration by anappellate Court, unless there has been a prejudice on the merits, The contention of the appellants, therefore, thatthe decree and judgment of the District Court, Monghyr, should be treated as a nullity cannot be sustained undersection 11 of the Suits Valuation Act.On behalf of the appellants Rajlakshmi Dasee V. Katyayani Dasee(1) and Shidappa Venkatrao v. RachappaSubrao(2) which was aﬃrmed by the Privy Council in Rachappa Subrao Jadhav v. Shidappa Venkatrao Jadhav(3)were relied on as supporting the contention (1) I.L.R. 38 Cal. 639.(2) I.L.R. 36 Bom, 628.(3) 46 I.A. 24..liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/43. h/02095954951i95wwwiiase95tml37 9/12/2KIRAN SINGH & ORS V. CHAMAN P ASWAN & ORS [14] INSC 43; AIR 14 SC 30; 15 SCR 17 (14 Aprl 14)123 that if the appellate Court would have had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal if the suit had been correctlyvalued, a decree passed by it must be treated as a nullity.In Rajlakshmi Dasee v. Katyayani Dasee(1), the facts were that one Katyayani Dasee instituted a suit to recover theestate of her husband Jogendra in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Alipore, valuing the claim at Rs. 2,100,whereas the estate was worth more than a lakh of rupees.The suit was decreed, and the defendants preferred an appeal to the District Court, which was the proper Court toentertain the appeal on the plaint valuation. There, the parties compromised the matter, and a consent decree waspassed, recognising the title of the defendants to portions of the estate. Then, Rajlakshmi Dasee, the daughter ofJogendra, ﬁled a suit for a declaration that the consent decree to which her mother was a party was not binding onthe reversioners. One of the grounds urged by her was that the suit of Katyayani was deliberately under-valued,that if it had been correctly valued, it was the High Court that would have had the ,competence to entertain theappeal, and that the con,sent decree passed by the District Judge was accordingly a nullity. In agreeing with thiscontention, the High Court observed that a decree passed by a Court which had no jurisdiction was a nullity, andthat even consent of the partes could not cure the defect. In that case, the question was raised by a person whowas not a party to the action and in a collateral proceeding, and the Court observed:"" We are not now called upon to consider what the eﬀect of such lack of, jurisdiction would be upon the decree, inso far as the parties thereto were concerned. It is manifest that so ﬁr as a stranger to the decree is concerned, whois interested in the property aﬀected by the decree, he can obviously ask for a declaration that the decree is anullity, because made by a Court which had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the litigation"" On the facts,the question of the eﬀect of section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act did not arise for determination, and was notconsidered.(1) I.L.R. 38 Cal. 639.124 In Shidappa Venkatrao v. Rachappa Subrao(1) the plaintiﬀs instituted a suit in the Court of the SubordinateJudge, First Class, for a declaration that he was the adopted son of one Venkatrao and for an injunction restrainingthe defendant from interfering with his possession of a house.The plaint valued the declaration at Rs. 130 and the injunction at Rs. 5, and the suit was valued for purposes ofpleader's fee at Rs. 69,016-9-0 being the value of the estate. The suit was decreed by the Subordinate Judge, andagainst his decree the defendant preferred an appeal to the District Court, which allowed the appeal anddismissed the suit. The plaintiﬀ took up the matter in second appeal to the High Court, and contended that on thevaluation in the plaint the appeal against the decree of the Subordinate Judge lay to the High Court, and that theappeal to the District Court was incompetent. This contention was upheld, and the decree of the District Judgewas set aside. It will be seen that the point in dispute was whether on the allegations in the plaint the value forpurposes of jurisdiction was Rs. 135 or Rs. 69,016-9-0, and the decision was that it was the latter. No question ofover-valuation or under-valuation arose,' and no decision on the scope of section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act wasgiven.As a result of its decision, the High Court came to entertain the matter as a ﬁrst appeal and aﬃrmed the decree ofthe Subordinate Judge. The defendant then took up the matter in appeal to the Privy Council in Rachappa SubraoJadhav v. Shidappa Venkatrao Jadhav(2), and there, his contention was that, in fact, on its true valuation the suitwas triable by the Court of the Subordinate Judge of the Second Class, and that the District Court was the properCourt to entertain the appeal. The Privy Council held that this objection which was "" the most technical oftechnicalities "" was not taken in the Court of ﬁrst instance, and that the Court would not be justiﬁed "" in assistingan objection of that type,"" and that it was also untenable. Before concluding, it observed:"" The Court Fees Act was passed not to arm a litigant with a weapon of technicality against his (1) I.L.R. 36 Bom.628.(2) 46 I.A. 24.125 opponent but to secure revenue for the beneﬁt of the State.......The defendant in this suit seeks to utilise theprovisions of the Act not to safeguard the interests of the State,but to obstruct, the plaintiﬀ ; he does not contendthat the Court wrongly decided to' the detriment of the revenue but that it dealt with the case without jurisdiction.In the circumstances this plea, advanced for the ﬁrst time at the hearing of the appeal in the District Court, ismisconceived, and was rightly rejected by the High Court."" Far from supporting the contention of the appellants.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/43. h/02095954951i95wwwiiase95tml47 9/12/2KIRAN SINGH & ORS V. CHAMAN P ASWAN & ORS [14] INSC 43; AIR 14 SC 30; 15 SCR 17 (14 Aprl 14)that the decree passed in appeal by the District Court of Monghyr should be regarded as a nullity, theseobservations show that an objection of the kind now put forward being highly technical in character should not beentertained if not raised in the Court of ﬁrst instance. We are therefore of opinion that the decree and judgment ofthe District Court, Monghyr, cannot be regarded as a nullity.It is next contended that even treating the matter as governed by section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act, there wasprejudice to the appellants, in that by reason of the under- valuation, their appeal was heard by a Court of inferiorjurisdiction, while they were entitled to a bearing by the High Court on the facts. It was argued that the right ofappeal was a valuable one, and that deprivation of the right of the appellants to appeal to the High Court on factsmust therefore be held, without more, to constitute prejudice.This argument proceeds on a misconception. The right of appeal is no doubt a substantive right, and itsdeprivation is a serious prejudice; but the appellants have not been deprived of the right of appeal against thejudgment of the Subordinate Court. The law does provide an appeal against that judgment to the District Court,and the plaintiﬀs have exercised that right. Indeed, the undervaluation has enlarged the appellants' right ofappeal, because while they would have had only a right of one appeal and that to the High Court if the suit hadbeen correctly valued, by reason of the under-valuation they obtained right to two appeals, one to the DistrictCourt and another to the High Court.The complaint of the 126 appellants really is not that they had been deprived of a right of appeal against thejudgment of the Subordinate Court, which they have not been, but that an appeal on the facts against thatjudgment was heard by the District Court and not by the High ,Court. This objection therefore amounts to this thata change in the forum of appeal is by itself a matter of prejudice for the purpose of section 1 1 of the SuitsValuation Act.The question, therefore, is, can a decree passed on appeal by a Court which had jurisdiction to entertain it only byreason of under-valuation be set aside on the ground that on a true valuation that Court was not competent -toentertain the appeal? Three High Courts have considered the matter in Full Benches, and have come to theconclusion that mere change of forum is not a prejudice within the meaning of section 11 of the Suits ValuationAct. Vide Kelu Achan v.Cheriya Parvathi Nethiar (1), Mool Chand v. Ram Kishan (2) and Ramdeo Singh y. Baj Narain (3). In our judgment,the opinion expressed in these decisions is correct. Indeed, it is impossible on the language of the section to cometo a diﬀerent conclusion. If the fact of an appeal being heard by a Subordinate Court or District Court where theappeal would have lain to the High Court if the correct valuation had been given is itself a matter of prejudice, thenthe decree passed by the Subordinate Court or the District Court must, without more, be liable to be set aside, andthe words ""unless the overvaluation or under-valuation thereof has prejudicially aﬀected the disposal of the suit orappeal on its merits"" would become wholly useless. These words clearly show that the decrees passed in suchcases are liable to be interfered with in an appellate Court, not in all cases and as a matter of course, but only ifprejudice such as is mentioned in the section results. And the prejudice envisaged by that section therefore mustbe something other than the appeal being heard in a diﬀerent forum. A contrary conclusion will lead to thesurprising result that the section was enacted with the object of curing (1) I.L.R. 46 Mad. 631.(2) I.L.R. 55 All. 315.(3) I.L.R. 27 Patna 109; A.I.R. 1949 Patna 278.127 defects of jurisdiction arising by reason of over-valuation, or under-valuation but that, in fact, this object hasnot been achieved. We are therefore clearly of opinion that the prejudice contemplated by the section issomething diﬀerent from the fact of the appeal having been heard in a forum which would not-have beencompetent to hear it on a correct valuation of the suit as ultimately determined.It is next argued that in the view that the decree of the lower appellate Court is liable to be reversed only on proofof prejudice on the merits, the second appellate Court must, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there wasprejudice, hear the appeal fully on the facts, and that, in eﬀect, it should be Heard as a ﬁrst appeal. Reliance isplaced in support of this contention on the observations of two of the learned Judges in Ramdeo Singh v. RaiNarain (1). There, Sinha J. observed that though the second appeal could not be treated as a ﬁrst appeal, prejudicecould be established by going into the merits of the decision both on questions of fact and of law,, and that thatcould be done under section 103 of the Civil Procedure Code. Meredith J. agreed that for determining whether.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/43. h/02095954951i95wwwiiase95tml57 9/12/2KIRAN SINGH & ORS V. CHAMAN P ASWAN & ORS [14] INSC 43; AIR 14 SC 30; 15 SCR 17 (14 Aprl 14)there was prejudice or not, there must be an enquiry on the merits of the decisions on questions of fact but he wasof opinion that that could be done under section I I of the Suits Valuation Act itself.Das J., however, declined to express any opinion on this point, as it did not arise at that stage. The complaint of theappellants is that the learned Judges who heard the second appeal, though they purported to follow the decisionin Ramdeo Singh v. A. Narain (1) did not, in fact, do so, and that there was no consideration of the evidencebearing on the questions of fact on which the parties were in dispute.That brings us to the question as to what is meant by prejudice"" in section II of the Suits Valuation Act. Does itinclude errors in ﬁndings on questions of fact in issue between the parties ? If it does, then it will be obligatory onthe Court hearing the second appeal to examine the evidence in full and decide whether the (1) I.L.R. 27 Patna tog;A.I. R, 1949 Patna 278.128 conclusions reached by the lower appellate Court are right.If it agrees with those ﬁndings, then it will aﬃrm the judgment; if it does not, it will reverse it. That means that theCourt of second appeal is virtually in the position of a Court of ﬁrst appeal. The language of section 11 of the SuitsValuation Act is plainly against such a view. It provides that overvaluation or under-valuation must haveprejudicially aﬀected the disposal of the case on the merits. The prejudice on the merits must be directlyattributable to over-valuation or under-valuation and an error in a ﬁnding of fact reached on a consideration of theevidence cannot possibly be said to have been caused by over-valution or under-valuation. Mere errors in theconclusions on the points for determination would therefore be clearly precluded by the language of the section. Itmust further be noted that there is no provision in the Civil Procedure Code, which authorises a Court of secondappeal to go into questions of fact on which the lower appellate Court has recorded ﬁndings and to reverse them.Section 103 was relied on in Ramdeo Singh v. Raj Narain (1) as conferring such a power. But that section appliesonly when the lower appellate Court has failed to record a ﬁnding on any issue, or when there had beenirregularities or defects such as fall under section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code. If these conditions exist, thejudgment under appeal is liable to be set aside in the exercise of the normal powers of a Court of second appealwithout resort to section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act. If they do not exist, there is no other power under the CivilProcedure Code authorising the Court of second appeal to set aside ﬁndings of fact and to re-hear the appeal itselfon those questions. We must accordingly hold that an appellate Court has no power under section 1 1 of the SuitsValuation Act to consider whether 'the ﬁndings of fact recorded by the lower appellate Court are correct, and thaterror in those ﬁndings cannot be held to be prejudice within the meaning of that section.So far, the deﬁnition of ""prejudice"" has been negative in terms-that it cannot be mere change of forum (1) I.L.R. 27Patna 109.129 Dr mere error in the decision on the merits. What then is Positively prejudice for the purpose of section 11 ?That is a question which has agitated Courts in India ever. since the enactment of the section. It has beensuggested that if there was no proper hearing of the suit or appeal and that had resulted in injustice, that would beprejudice within section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act. Another instance of prejudice is when a suit which ought tohave been ﬁled as an original suit -is ﬁled as a result of under-valuation on the small cause side. - The procedure fortrial of suits in the Small Cause Court is summary; there are no provisions for discovery or inspection; evidence isnot recorded in extenso, and there is no right of appeal against its deci- sion. The defendant thus loses the beneﬁtof an elaborate procedure and a right of appeal which he would have had, if the suit had been ﬁled on the originalside. It can be said in such a case that the disposal of the suit by the Court of Small Causes has prejudiciallyaﬀected the merits of the case. No purpose, however, is. served by attempting to enumerate exhaustively allpossible cases of prejudice which might come under section II of the Suits Valuation Act. The jurisdiction that isconferred on appellate Courts under that section is an equitable one, to be exercised when there has been anerroneous assumption of jurisdiction by a Subordinate Court as a result of over-valuation or under- valuation and aconsequential failure of justice. It is neither possible nor even desirable to deﬁne such a risdiction. closely, orconﬁne it within stated bounds. Pt can only be predicated of it that it is in the nature of a revisional jurisdiction tobe exercised with caution and for the ends of justice, whenever the facts and ,situations call for it. Whether therehas been prejudice or not is, accordingly, a matter to be determined on the facts of each case.We have now to see whether the appellants have suﬀered any prejudice by reason of the under-valuation. Theywere. the plaintiﬀs in the action. They valued the suit at Rs..liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/43. h/02095954951i95wwwiiase95tml67 9/12/2KIRAN SINGH & ORS V. CHAMAN P ASWAN & ORS [14] INSC 43; AIR 14 SC 30; 15 SCR 17 (14 Aprl 14)2,950. The defendants raised no objection to the jurisdiction of the Court at any time. When the plaintiﬀs lost thesuit after an elaborate 17 130 trial, it is they who appealed to the District Court as they were bound to, on theirvaluation. Even there, the defendants took no objection to the jurisdiction of the District Court to hear the appeal.When the deci sion went on the merits against the plaintiﬀs, they preferred S. A.No. 1152 of 1946 to the High Court of Patna, and if the Stamp Reporter had not raised the objection to thevaluation and to the Court-fee paid, the plaintiﬀs would not have challenged the jurisdiction of the District Courtto hear the appeal. It would be an unfortunate state of the law, if the plaintiﬀs who initiated proceedings in a Courtof their own choice could subsequently turn round and question its jurisdiction on the ground of an error invaluation which was their own. If the law were that the decree of a Court which would have had no jurisdictionover the suit or appeal but for the over-valuation or undervaluation should be treated as a nullity, then of course,they would not be estopped from setting up want of jurisdiction in the Court by the fact of their having themselvesinvoked it. That, however, is not the position under section 1 1 of the Suits Valuation Act. Why then should theplaintiﬀs be allowed to resile from the position taken up by them to. the prejudice of their opponents, who hadacquiesced therein ? There is considerable authority in the Indian Courts that clausts (a) and (b) of section I 1 of theSuits Valuation Act should be read conjunctively, notwithstanding the use of the word ""or."" If that is the correctinterpretation, the plaintiﬀs would be precluded from raising the objection about jurisdiction in an appellate Court.But even if the two provisions are to be construed disjunctively, and the parties held entitled under section 1 1 (1)(b) to raise the objection for the ﬁrst time in the appellate Court, even then, the recuirement as to prejudice has tobe satisﬁed, and the party who has resorted to a forum of his own choice on his own valuation cannot himself beheard to complain of any prejudice. Prejudice can be a ground for relief only when it is due to the action of anotherparty and not when it results from one's own act. Courts cannot recognise that as prejudice which ﬂows from theaction of the 131 very party who complains about it. Even apart from this, we are satisﬁed that no prejudice wascaused to the appellants by their appeal having been heard by the District Court.There was a fair and full hearing of the appeal by that Court;' it gave its decision on the merits on a considerationof the entire evidence in the case, and no injustice is shown to have resulted in its disposal of the matter. Thedecision of the learned Judges that there were no grounds for interference under section 11 of the Suits ValuationAct is correct.In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed."

K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General for India (J. B.Dadachanji and A. C. Dave, with him) for respondent No. 1.1954. April 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GHULAM HASAN J.-This appeal brought by theauction- purchasers by special leave raises the question of the validity of a sale of certain properties which tookplace on August 13, 1942. The respondents are the judgment-debtor and the legal representative of the deceaseddecree-holder.The decree-holder applied on March 30, 1940, for execution of his decree by sale of 4 lots of property 110belonging to the judgment-debtor. The properties were valued it Rs. 1,50,000 and were subject to a previousmortgage of Rs. 60,000 existing in favour of the auction--purchasers. It appears that under the terms of themortgage-deed the mortgagees were entitled to proceed in the ﬁrst instance against -the ﬁrst 3 lots and againstthe fourth lot only in the event of a deﬁciency in sale price to cover the deceretal amount. The ﬁrst 3 lots withwhich alone we are concerned in the appeal were sold to the mortgagees for Rs. 53,510 on August 13, 1942. Theywere sold free from the encumbrance under the order of the Court passed at the instance of the decree-holder andthe mortgagees but without notice to the judgment-debtor. It may, however,, be noted that on the application ofcertain third parties their right of annuity over the properties sought to be sold was notiﬁed in the saleproclamation. On the same date the mortgagees applied for a set-oﬀ stating that the purchase price was Rs.53,510 while the amount due to them was Rs. 1, 20,000. The Court allowed the set-oﬀ then and there. It isimportant to bear in mind that the mortgagees had ﬁled no suit and obtained no decree to recover the money dueon the mortgage.The order notifying the claim to annuity was challenged by the Judgment-debtor in' revision to the High Court butit was dismissed on November 10, 1943 by Sen J. who observed that as the sale had already taken place, theproper remedy of the judgment-debtor was to move the Court for setting aside the sale. Thereupon the judgment-debtor applied on November 20, 1943, under Order XXI, rule 90, of the Civil Procedure Code to have the sale setaside (Exhibit 51).Allegations imputing fraud and collusion to the mortgagees were made in the application, in particular it wasalleged that the 3 lots were purchased at a grossly. inadequate price by under-valuing them in the proclamationand that the mortgagees not having paid 25% of the bid, the sale should not have been sanctioned in their favour.While this application was pending, the judgment-debtor made another application on January 15, 1947,challenging the sale as a nullity on the ground that the purchaser had neither 111 made the deposit required underrule 84 of Order XXI, nor paid the balance of the purchase-price as required by rule 86, and praying for. resale ofthe property to realise the price. The order allowing set-oﬀ was attracted as being without jurisdiction. Noseparate order was passed on this application as the application Exhibit 51 was granted on the same grounds. Thetrial Court found that at the time of attachment on April 30, 1940, lots Nos. I and 2 and lot No.3 were valued at Rs. 40,000 each separately but at the time of proclamation of sale on March 6, 1942, the ﬁrst twowere valued at Rs. 45,000 and the third at Rs. 8,000 only. The property did not consist of mere survey numbers butadmittedly had bungalows, and superstructures and in the opinion of the Court the subsequent valuation wasbound to mislead bidders. The. Court, however, set aside the sale on the ground that the provisions of Order XXI,rules 84 and 85, had not been complied with in that the price was not deposited but a set-oﬀ was wrongly claimedand allowed in the absence of the judgment-debtor by the Court which had no authority or jurisdiction. The Courtobserved.""There is nothing to show that these opponents took any permission from the Court to bid at the auction and infact they could hardly have obtained any such permission, they being mortgagees whose dues had yet to bewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/44.html/020195495499525 9/12/2MANILAL MOHANLAL SHAH & ORS V. SARDAR SAYED AHMED SAYED MAHMAD & ANR [] INSC 44; AIR 14 SC 39; 1…proved and determined. If they could ask for set-oﬀ, there is no reason why they should not be required also toseek previous permission from the Court to bid under Order XXI, rule 72, of the Civil Procedure Code. It may benoted that one of these opponents is himself a pleader and he was not justiﬁed in taking such an unauthorisedorder from the Court without fully acquainting with all the facts. Under all these circumstances, these opponentscan with little justiﬁcation avoid the consequences of noncompliance with the provisions of Order XXI, rules 84 and85, referred to above. 'Without proving their claim under the mortgage, they have succeeded in purchasing for agross under-value these properties and even that value they have not paid in Court by taking recourse to thedevice of set- oﬀ................................. In my opinion, there could not be a 112 more fraudulent and materiallyirregular procedure than what has taken place in the present case at the instance of these mortgagees, to thegreat detriment and injury of the present applicant, viz., the judgment debtor."" The Court held that the applicationunder rule 90 was barred by limitation but this being a case of a void sale and not of a mere material irregularitythe Court was bound to re- sell the property irrespective of any application being made by the judgment-debtor.The High Court of Bombay (Chagla C. J. and Gajendragadkar J.) dismissed the appeal of the mortgagee-purchaserson the ground that the order of the trial Court was under Order XXI, rule 84 and/or rule 86, of the Civil ProcedureCode and therefore. no appeal lay against such an order. The High Court held that the order of set-oﬀ was withoutjurisdiction and the subsequent deposit of the purchase price on December 14, 1945, made long after the periodhad elapsed was of no avail.One of the auction-purchasers, who is a pleader, has himself argued the appeal before us. The principal questionwhich falls to be considered is whether the failure to make the deposit under Order XXI, rules 84 and 85, is only amaterial irregularity in the sale which can only be set aside under rule 90 or whether it is wholly void. It is arguedthat the case falls within the former category and the application under rule 90 being barred by limitation, the salecannot be set aside. It is also contended that the Court having once allowed the set-oﬀ and condoned the failure todeposit, the mistake of the Court should not be allowed to prejudice the purchasers who would certainly havedeposited the purchase price but for the mistake. We are of opinion that both the contentions are devoid ofsubstance. In order to resolve this controversy a reference to the relevant rules of Order XXI of the Civil ProcedureCode will be necessary. These rules are 72, 84, 85 and 86:"" 72. (1) No holder of a decree in execution of which property is sold shall, without the express permission of theCourt, bid for or purchase the property.113 (2) Where a decree-holder -purchases with such permission, the purchase-money and the amount due on, thedecree may, subject to the provisions of section 73, be set oﬀ against one another.........................(3) Where a decree-holder purchases, by himself or through another person, without such permission, the Courtmay, if it thinks ﬁt, on the application of the judgment-debtor or any other person whose interests are aﬀected bythe sale, by order set aside the sale ..............................................""84. (1) On every sale of immovable property the person declared to be the purchaser shall pay immediately aftersuch declaration a deposit of twenty-ﬁve per cent. on the amount of his purchase-money to the oﬃcer or otherperson conducting the sale, and in default of such deposit, the property shall forthwith be resold.(2) Where the decree-holder is the purchaser and is entitled to set oﬀ the purchase-money under rule 72, the Courtmay dispense with the requirement of this rule."" 85. The full amount of purchase-money -payable shall be paid by the purchaser into Court before the Court closeson the ﬁfteenth day from the sale of the propertyProvided that, in calculating the amount to be so paid into Court, the purchaser shall have the advantage of anyset-oﬀ to which he may be entitled under rule 72.86. In default of payment within the period mentioned in the last preceding rule, the deposit may, if the Courtthinks ﬁt, after defraying the expenses of the sale, be forfeited to the Government, and the, property shall be re-sold, and the defaulting purchaser shall forfeit all claim to the property or to any part of the sum for which it maysubsequently be sold."" The scheme of the rules quoted above may be shortly stated.A decree-holder cannot purchase property at the Court- auction in execution of his own decree without theexpress permission of the Court and that when he does so with such permission, he is entitled to a set-oﬀ, but if hedoes so without such permission, then 15 114 the Court has a discretion to set aside the sale upon the applicationwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/44.html/020195495499535 9/12/2MANILAL MOHANLAL SHAH & ORS V. SARDAR SAYED AHMED SAYED MAHMAD & ANR [] INSC 44; AIR 14 SC 39; 1…by the judgment-debtor, or any other 'person whose interests are aﬀected by the sale (Rule.72). As a matter ofpure construction this provision is obviously directory and not mandatory - See Rai Radha Krishna and Others v.Bisheshar Sahai and Others (1). The moment a person is declared to be the purchaser, he is bound to deposit 25per cent. of the purchase-money unless he happens to be the decree-holder, in which case the Court may notrequire him to do so (Rule 84).The provision regarding the deposit of 25 per cent. by the purchaser other than the decree-holder is mandatory asthe language of the rule suggests. The full amount of the purchase-money must be paid within ﬁfteen days fromthe date of the sale but the decree-holder is entitled to the advantage of a set-oﬀ. The provision for payment is,.however, mandatory... (Rule 85). If the payment is not made within the period of ﬁfteen days, the Court has thediscretion to forfeit the deposit, and there the discretion ends but the obligation of the Court to re-sell theproperty is imperative. A further consequence of non-payment is that the defaulting purchaser forfeits all claim tothe property (Rule 86).It is not denied that the purchasers had not obtained any decree on foot of their mortgage and the claim of Rs.1,20,000 which they put forward before the execution Court had not been adjudicated upon or determined. Themortgagees, one of whom is a pleader, applied on the day of the sale claiming a set-oﬀ on foot of the mortgage.The Court without applying its mind to the quest-ion immediately passed the order allowing the set-oﬀ. This claimwas obviously not admissible under the provisions of rule 84 which applies only to the decree-holder. The Courthad clearly no jurisdiction to allow a set-oﬀ. The appellants misled the Court into passing a wrong order andobtaining the advantage of a set-oﬀ while they knew perfectly well that they had got no decree on foot of themortgage and their claim was undetermined. There was default in (1) 49 I.A. 312.115 depositing 25 percent of the purchase-money and further there was no payment of the full amount of thepurchase- money within ﬁfteen days from the date of the sale. Both the deposit and the payment of the purchase-money being mandatory under the combined eﬀect of rules 84 and 85, the Court has the discretion to forfeit thedeposit but it was bound to re-sell the property with the result that on default the purchaser forfeited all claim tothe property.These provisions leave no doubt that unless the deposit and the payment are made as required by the mandatoryprovisions of the rules, there is no sale in the eye of law in favour of the defaulting purchaser and no right to ownand possess the property accrues to him.In two cases decided by the Calcutta High Court, viz., Munshi Md. Ali Meah v. Kibria Khatun (1), and Sm.Annapurna Dasi v. Bazley Karim Fazley Moula (2), the sale was held to be no sale where the purchaser had failed todeposit the balance of the purchase-money as required by rule 85. A similar view was taken by a Division Bench ofthe Allahabad High Court in Nawal Kishore and Others v.Buttu Mal and Subhan Singh (3). The provisions of rule 86 were held to be mandatory in another decision of thesame Court, Haji Inam Ullah v. Mohammad Idris (4), and it was held that the Court was bound to re-sell theproperty upon default irrespective of any application being made by any party to the proceedings. -The case ofBhim Singh v. Sarwan Singh (5) was a case of failure to make a deposit as required by section 306 of the Code of1882 (corresponding to rule 85 of the present Code). The Court treated it as a material irregularity in conductingthe sale which must be enquired into upon the application under section 311, (corresponding to rule 90 of thepresent Code), and not by a separate suit to set aside the sale. The Court did not apply its mind to the questionwhether the provisions of section 306 being mandatory the sale should not be treated as a nullity for non-compliance with those provisions, The decision of (1) 15 Weekly Notes (Cal.)

There theauction-purchaser had actually tendered the money but the payment was postponed by consent of partiespending the disposal of the objection by the judgment debtor. We do not agree with the remark made in that casethat the provisions of rule 85 are intended ""to be directory only and not absolutely mandatory."" A Division Benchof the same Court (Tek Chand and Abdul Rashid JJ.) held in A. R. Davar v.Jhinda Ram (2), that the Court had no jurisdiction to extend the time for the payment of the balance of thepurchase- money under rule 85 and must order resale under rule 86.Having examined the language of the relevant rules and the judicial decisions bearing upon the subject we are ofopinion that the provisions of the rules requiring the deposit of 25 per cent. of the purchase-money immediatelyon the person being declared as a purchaser and the payment of the balance within 15 days of the sale aremandatory and upon non-compliance with these provisions there is no sale at all. The rules do not contemplatethat there can be any sale in favour of a purchaser without depositing 25 per cent. of the purchase-money in theﬁrst instance and the balance within 15 days. When there is no sale within the contemplation of these rules, therecan be no question of material irregularity in the conduct of the sale. Non- payment of the price on the part of thedefaulting purchaser renders the sale proceedings as a complete nullity. The very fact that the Court is bound toresell the property in the event of a default shows that the previous proceedings for sale are completely wiped outas if they do not exist in the eye of law. We hold, therefore, that in the circumstances of the present case there wasno sale and the purchasers acquired. no rights at all.It was urged before us that the Court could allow a set-oﬀ in execution proceedings under its inherent powersapart from the provisions of Order XXI, rule 19, of the Civil Procedure Code. We do not think that the inherentpowers of the Court could be invoked to (1) A.I.R. 1931 Lah. 15.(2) A.I.R. 1938 Lah. 195.117 circumvent the mandatory provisions of the Code and relieve the purchasers of their obligation to make thedeposit. The appellants by misleading the Court want' to beneﬁt by the mistake to which they themselvescontributed. They cannot be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong;The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed."

The suitwas dismissed by the trial Judge by his judgment dated the 23rd of July, 1945. On an appeal being taken againstthat decision by the plaintiﬀ to the High Court of Madras, a Division Bench of the High -Court by its judgmentdated the 28th of March, 1949, allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment of the trial Court., The defendantNo. 1 has now come up on appeal to this Court on the strength of a certiﬁcate granted by the High Court underarticle 133 of the Constitution read with sections 109 and 1 10 of the Civil Procedure Code.To appreciate the contentions that have been raised before us it may be necessary to give a short resume of thematerial facts. The land in suit, which has an area of a little over 9 acres, was admittedly the property of oneBasappa who died some time before 1918, leaving three daughters, to wit Paramma, Pompamma andHampamma. Under a settlement entered into with the immediate reversioner of Basappa which is evidenced bytwo registered deeds-Exhibits P-2 and P-3-executed respectively in the years 1918 and 1919, the three sisters gotabout 15 to 16 acres of wet land 133 in absolute right. Hampamma subsequently took away her one- third share inthese lands and we are not concerned with her any further in this litigation. Paramma and Pompamma continuedto enjoy the remaining two-thirds share of the property and it is this two-thirds ,share comprising 9 acres 49 centsof wet land which forms the subject-matter of the present suit. Pompamma married one Nagana Gowd and aftergiving birth to two sons to wit Siddalingana and Chenabasa- vana, she died in the year 1923. It is not disputed thather share in the lands mentioned above devolved upon these two sons. After Pompamma's death, Nagana marriedagain and stayed with his second wife in his ancestral village, while these two infant sons of Pompamma remainedat village Kampli with Paramma, their mother's sister, who reared them up as her own sons. On the 22nd June,1923, Paramma executed a deed of gift in favour of the two sons of her sister by which she conveyed to the latterher own share in the. suit property. The result was that the two sons of Pompamma got the entirety of the 9 acres49 cents of land which as owned jointly by their mother and their mother's sister Paramma.Shortly after this gift was made, Siddalingana, the elder son of Pompamma, died in the year 1924 and theplaintiﬀ 's case is that his half-share in the disputed property devolved upon his father Nagkna under the Hindu lawof inheritance. It is admitted however that Paramma continued to possess the entirety of the land on behalf of theyounger son Chenabasavana who is defendant No. 1 in the suit On the 25th August, 1946, there was a lease deedExhibit D-1, and its counter part Exhibit D-2, executed by and between Paramma on the one hand and Nagana asthe father and guardian of the infant Chenabasavana on the other by which the infant represented by his fatherpurported to grant a lease of the entire property to Paramma for a period of 12 years at a rental of Rs. 500 a year.Two rent receipts passed by Nagana to Paramma in token of the receipt of rents, reserved by this lease, on behalfof Chenabasavana have been proved in this case, Exhibits D-4 and D4-1, and they are of the years 1927 and 1932respectively.134 It appears that in 1934 Nagana instituted a suit as guardian of his infant son Chenabasavana in the Munsif 'sCourt at Hospet to recover a -sum of Rs. 500 as rent from Paramma on the basis of the lease mentioned above.The suit was decreed ex parte and the decree was discharged later on by a document Exhibit D-3, dated the 14thof November, 1934, executed by Nagana, which contains a recital that as Paramma had borrowed much money topurchase lands for the minor, all future rents payable under the lease were also to be considered as fully paid. It isin evidence and not disputed, that near about this time Nagana became ﬁnancially involved and on the 27th ofAugust, 1935, he executed a deed of mortgage by conditional sale in respect of half-share of the disputed land infavour of defendant No. 2 to secure an advance of Rs. 3,000. The document recites that the half-share of the landwhich was kept as.security devolved upon the mortgagor on the death of his son Siddalingana and ""that he was in possession of thesame. On the 16th July, 1936, Nagana sold the mortgaged property by,a deed of sale (Exhibit P-6) to themortgagee himself: or a consideration of Rs. 3,000 which was the principal sum due under the mortgage. It isadmitted that the purchaser did not and could not obtain possession -of the property at any time since then andon the 2nd May, 1944, he sold the property to the 'plaintiﬀ by a conveyance which is Exhibit P-1. On the 18th July,1944, the plaintiﬀ brought the present suit against Chenabasavana as defendant No. I for recovery of ademarcated half-share of the disputed property after partition with the latter on the strength of the purchasementioned above and his own vendor was impleaded as defendant No. 2 in the suit.The suit was contested by defendant No. 1 and a number of pleas were taken by him in his written statement. Thesubstantial defence put forward was of a two-fold character.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 45.html/02095959524 9/12/2WUNTAKAL YALPI CHENABASAVANA GOWD V. RAO BAHADUR Y. MAHABALESHWARAPPA & ANR [14] INSC 45; AIR 14 …It was contended in the ﬁrst place that under the deed of gift executed by Paramma in favour of defendant No. Iand his deceased brother Siddalingana, the donees became joint tenants with rights of survivorship Consequentlyon the death of 135 Siddalingana his interest devolved upon defendant No. 1 and not on his father. The other andthe more material defence raised was that the plaintiﬀ 's suit was barred, as he was never in possession of theproperty and the defendant No. 1 acquired a good title by adverse possession. Both these points were decidedagainst the plaintiﬀ by the learned District Judge who tried the suit. It was held that the deed of gift executed byParamma conferred no right on Nagana as the heir of his son and such rights if any were speciﬁcally disclaimed byNagana by the lease deed and also by the receipts which he granted to Paramma as the guardian of his minor son.It was held further that the plaintiﬀ 's suit was bound to fail as he or his predecessors were never in possession ofthe property within 12 years from the date of the suit. The plaintiﬀ indeed was an alienee of a co- tenant but it washeld that the ordinary rule of one co- owner being presumed to hold on behalf of the others could not apply to thepresent case., as Nagana disclaimed his rights as a co-owner and purported to act only on behalf of his infant sonChenabasavana whose exclusive title to the lands he deﬁnitely acknowledged. In view of these ﬁndings the trialJudge dismissed the plaintiﬀ 's suit.Thereupon the plaintiﬀ took an appeal against this -decision to the High Court of Madras and the appeal washeard by a Division Bench consisting of Rajamannar C.J. and Balakrishna Ayyar J. The learned Judges held,diﬀering from the trial Court, that the two sons of Pompamma took their shares in their mother's property whichdevolved upon them by inheritance, its well as in the property which they obtained under the deed of gift executedin their favour by Paramma, as tenants in common and not as joint tenants and consequently on the death ofSiddalingana his interest vested in his father Nagana and not in his brother, the defendant No. I. On the otherquestion the High Court held that though.Nagana by his acts and conduct in connection with the execution of thelease deed did exhibit an animus to hold the property solely on behalf of Chenabasavana to the exclusion ofhimself, yet this animus did not last beyond 1935 when he 136 asserted his own right as a co-sharer to half-shire ofthe- plaint property by executing the mortgage deed in favour of defendant No. 2. In these circumstances it washeld that the defendant No. 1 did not acquire title by adverse possession and the plaintiﬀ was entitled to succeed.The defendant No. 1 has now come up on appeal to this Court.Mr. Ayyangar appearing in support of the appeal has not pressed before us the contention that was raised onbehalf of his client in the Courts below, that as the two brothers took the property as joint tenants and not astenants in common, the interest of Siddalingana passed on his death to his brother, the defendant No. 1, and notto Nagana. We must take it therefore that after the death of Siddalingana, Nagana became a co-owner of thedisputed property with his minor son Chenabasavana. As the plaintiﬀ purports to derive his title from Nagana, hecan be said to have established his title as a co-owner with defendant No. I and this being the position, thepresumption of law would be that the possession of one co-owner was on behalf of the other also unless actualouster was proved. To defeat the claims of the plaintiﬀ therefore it is incumbent upon defendant No. I to provethat he held the property adversely to his co-owner -for the statutory period. The peculiarity of the present cage isthat here the joint owners of the property were the father and his infant son, of whom the father himself was theguardian and th e infant could not act in law except through the guardian.It is conceded on behalf of the appellant that the mere fact that the father did not participate in the proﬁts of theproperty which was left to the management of Paramrna on behalf of the infant could not by itself make thepossession of the son adverse to his father. But the acts and conduct of the father in connection with the leasedeed of 1926 and the subsequent granting of receipts in terms thereof undoubtedly point to something more thanmere non- participation in the enjoyment of proﬁts of the property on absence of objection to the exclusiveenjoyment there of by Paramma on behalf of the infant, In granting the 137 lease on behalf of the infant the fatherdeﬁnitely asserted the exclusive title of his son to the property and by implication denied his own rights as a co-owner thereto. In law the possession of the lessee is the possession of the lessor and consequently ever since 1926when Paramma began to possess the property as a lessee in terms of the ease deed, her possession in law was thepossession of the infant alone to the exclusion of Nagana, the father. The fact that Nagana consented to suchexclusion is immaterial. There can be in law, under certain circumstances, adverse possession with the consent ofthe true owner. A common illustration of this rule is furnished 'by the class of cases where the legal owner of aproperty transfers the same to another without the requisite legal formalities and though the transferee does notacquire a legal title to it by the transfer, yet if he gets possession of the property though with the consent of thetransferor that possession becomes adverse to the owner and if continued for the statutory period creates a title inhim. We are not satisﬁed from the materials in this case that Nagana was ignorant of his rights as heir of hisdeceased son when he executed the lease in the year 1926., But even if he was, as the exclusive possession of theinfant was exercised with the full knowledge and consent of the father who openly acknowledged the title of hiswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 45.html/02095959534 9/12/2WUNTAKAL YALPI CHENABASAVANA GOWD V. RAO BAHADUR Y. MAHABALESHWARAPPA & ANR [14] INSC 45; AIR 14 …son, such possession could not but be adverse to the father. The learned Judges of the High Court seem to be ofthe opinion that the possession of the minor could be regarded as adverse from the date of the execution of thelease, as the father by being a party to the said document, did exhibit an animus to possess the common propertyon behalf of the minor alone to the exclusion of himself. But according to the learned Judges this animus ceased assoon as Nagana executed the mortgage deed in 1935, asserting his right as, joint owner of the property in disputeand the adverse possession of the son forthwith came to an end. With this view we are unable to agree.Once it is held that the, possession of a co-sharer has become adverse to the other co-sharer as a result of ouster,the mere assertion of his joint title by the 138 dispossessed co-sharer would not interrupt the running of adversepossession. He must actually and eﬀectively break up the exclusive possession of his co-sharer by re-entry uponthe property or by resuming possession in such manner as it was possible to do. It may also check the running oftime if the co-sharer who is in exclusive possession acknowledges the title of his coowner or discontinues hisexclusive possession of the property. On the materials on the record, none of these things seems to have beenproved in the present case. Resumption of physical possession or re-entry upon the property was absolutely out ofthe question, as the property was in the possession of a lessee.The lease, it should be noted, was executed in 1926 and we have two rent receipts of the years 1927 and 1932respectively by v which Nagana acknowledged receipt of rents on behalf of his infant son in terms of the leasedeed. The rent suit in 1934 was also brought by him in his capacity as guardian of defendant No. 1 and thedocument Exhibit D-3 by which the decree in that suit was discharged and a receipt was given in advance for allthe subsequent rents point deﬁnitely to the conclusion that the entire rent for the whole period of 12 years waspaid to and was accepted on behalf of Chenabasavana and Nagana neither received any por- tion of it nor laid anyclaim to the same. During the whole period of the lease and up to the present day the minor is admittedly inpossession of the property and no act or conduct on his part has been proved either within the period of limitationor even after that which might be regarded as an acknowledgment of the title of his father as co-owner.In our opinion the fact that the father who had allowed himself to be dispossessed by his son exhibited later on hisanimus to treat the property as the joint property of himself and his son cannot arrest the running of adversepossession in favour of the son. A mere mental act on the part of the person dispossessed unaccompanied by anychange of possession cannot aﬀect the continuity of adverse possession of the deseizor.The view taken by the High Court probably rests on the supposition that as, it was the father, who, acting 139 onbehalf of his son, asserted the exclusive title of the- son to the property in denial of his own rights, it was open tothe father again if he so chose to resile from that position and make a fresh declaration that property was not thesole property of the son but belonged to him as well;and this subsequent act would annul the consequences of his previous act. This reasoning does not appear to us tobe sound. The father's acts in connection with the lease were entirely in his capacity as guardian of his son. In theeye of the law they were the acts of the son, but the creation of the mortage in 1935 was not the act of the fatheron behalf of his son, it was the personal act of the father himself qua co-proprietor of the son and the interest ofone being adverse to the other such acts could not be held to be acts of the son performed through the father. It isextremely doubtful whether qua guardian the father could make such declaration at all. Any change of intentionon the part of the guardian can be brought home to the minor through the guardian alone and the minor can reactto it again only through the guardian. It may be proper in such cases for the father to renounce his guardianshipbefore he could assert any right of his own against his ward; but it is not necessary for us to go into that question,as the mortgage in this case was made by the father no I t as guardian of the minor at all. It was no more than adeclaration, by a person who was dispossessed by his co- sharer, of his joint title to the property and as has beenalready pointed out, as it did not involve any change of possession it did not aﬀect the adverse possession of thedeseizor. In our opinion therefore the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court is not proper and cannotbe sustained. The result is that the appeal is allowed; the ,judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside andthose of the District Judge restored. The appellant will have his costs in all the Courts.Appeal allowed."

It appears to me to be diﬃcultto maintain this distinction as relevant to the interpretation of section 116. The section refers in express terms tothe exercise of religion, and therefore it is intended to protect from the operation of any Commonwealth laws actswhich are done in the exercise of religion. Thus the section goes far beyond protecting liberty of opinion. Itprotects also acts. done in pursuance of religious belief as part of religion."" These observations apply fully to theprotection of religion as guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.Restrictions by the State upon free exercise of religion are permitted both under articles 25 and 26 on grounds ofpublic order,. morality and health. Clause (2)(a) of article 25 reserves the right of the State to regulate or restrictany economic, ﬁnancial, political and other secular activities which may be associated with religious practice andthere is a further right given to the State by sub-clause (b) under which the State can (1) Vide Adelaide Company V.The Commonwealth 67 C.L.R.116, 127 1025 legislate for social welfare and reform even though by so doing it might interfere with religiouspractices. The learned Attorney-General lays stress upon clause (2)(a) of the article and his contention is that allsecular activities, which may be associated with religion but do not really constitute an essential part of it, areamenable to State regulation.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095918 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …The contention formulated in such broad terms cannot, we think, be supported. In the ﬁrst place, what constitutesthe essential part of a religion is primarily to be ascertained with reference to the doctrines of that religion itself. Ifthe tenets of any religious sect of the Hindus prescribe that oﬀerings of food should be given to the idol atparticular hours of the day, that periodical ceremonies should be performed in a certain way at certain periods ofthe year or that there should be daily recital of sacred texts or ablations to the sacred ﬁre, all these would beregarded as parts of religion and the mere fact that they involve expenditure of money or employment of priestsand servants or the use of marketable commodities would not make them secular activities partaking of acommercial or economic character; all of them are religious.practices and should be regarded as matters of religion within the meaning of article 26(b). What article 25(2)(a)contemplates is not regulation by the State of religious practices as such, the freedom of which is guaranteed bythe Constitution except when they run counter to public order, health and morality, but regulation of activitieswhich are economic, commercial or political in their character though they are associated with religious practices.We may refer in this connection to a few American and Australian cases, all of which arose out of the activities ofpersons connected with the religious association known as ""Jehova's Witnesses."" This association of personsloosely organised throughout Australia, U.S.A. and other countries regard the literal interpretation of the Bible asfundamental to proper religious beliefs. This belief in the supreme Authority of the Bible colours many of theirpolitical ideas. They refuse to take oath of allegiance to the king or other Constituted 1026 human authority andeven to show respect to the national ﬂag, and they decry all wars between nations and all kinds of war activities. In1941 a company of "" Jehova's Witnesses "" incorporated in Australia commenced proclaiming and teaching matterswhich were prejudicial to war activities and the defence of the Commonwealth and steps were taken against themunder the National Security Regulations of the State. The legality of the action of the Government was questionedby means of a writ petition before the High Court and the High Court held that the action of the Government wasjustiﬁed and that section 116, which guaranteed freedom of religion under the Australian Constitution, was not inany way infringed by the National Security Regulations(1). These were undoubtedly political activities thougharising out of religious belief entertained by a particular community. In such cases, as Chief Justice Latham pointedout, the provision for protection of religion was not an absolute protection to be interpreted and appliedindependently of other provisions of the Constitution. These privileges must be reconciled with the right of theState to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace, security and orderly living without which constitutionalguarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery.The courts of America were at one time greatly agitated over the question of legality of a State regulation whichrequired the pupils in public schools on pain of compulsion to participate in a daily ceremony of saluting thenational ﬂag, while reciting in unison, a pledge of allegiance to it in a certain set formula. The question arose inMinersville School District, Board of Education, etc. v. Gobitis(2). In that case two small children, Lillian andWilliam Gobitis, were expelled from the public school of Minersville, Pennsylvania, for refusing to salute thenational ﬂag as part of the daily exercise. The Gobitis family were aﬃliated with ""Jehova's Witnesses"" and hadbeen (1) Vide Adelaide Company v. The Commonwealth, [ 1943] HCA 12; 67 C.L.R., 116, 127.(2) [ 1940] USSC 105; 310 U.S. 586.1027 brought up conscientiously to believe that such a gesture of respect for the ﬂag was forbidden by thescripture. The point for decision by the Supreme Court was whether the requirement of participation in such aceremony exacted from a child, who refused upon sincere religious ground, infringed the liberty of religionguaranteed by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments ? The court held by a majority that it did not and that itwas within the province of the legislature and the school authorities to adopt appropriate means to evoke andfoster a sentiment of. national unity amongst the children in public schools. The Supreme Court, however,changed their views on this identical point in the later case of West Virginia State Board of Education v.Barnette(1). There it was held overruling the earlier decision referred to above that the action of a State in makingit compulsory for children in public schools to salute the ﬂag and pledge allegiance constituted a violation of theFirst and the Fourteenth Amendments. This diﬀerence in judicial opinion brings out forcibly the diﬃcult task whicha court has to perform in cases of this type where the freedom or religious convictions genuinely entertained bymen come into conﬂict with the proper political attitude which is expected from citizens in matters of unity andsolidarity of the State organization.As regards commercial activities, which are prompted by religious beliefs, we can cite the case of Murdock v.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951018 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …Pennsylvania(2). Here also the petitioners were ""Jehova's Witnesses"" and they went about from door to door in thecity of Jeannette distributing literature and soliciting people to purchase certain religious books and pamphlets, allpublished by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. A municipal ordinance required religious colporteurs to paya licence tax as a condition to the pursuit of their activities. The petitioners were convicted and ﬁned for violationof the ordinance. It was held that the ordinance in question was invalid under the Federal Constitution asconstituting a denial of freedom of speech, press and religion;(1) [ 1943] USSC 130; 319 U.S. 624.(2) [ 1943] USSC 91; 319 U.S. 105.1028 and it was held further that upon the facts of the case it could not be said that ""Jehova's Witnesses"" wereengaged in a commercial rather than in a religious venture. Here again, it may be pointed out that a contrary viewwas taken only a few years before in the case of Jones v. Opelika(1), and it was held that a city ordinance, whichrequired that licence be procured and taxes paid for the business of selling books and pamphlets on the streetsfrom house to house, was applicable to a member of a religious Organisation who was engaged in selling theprinted propaganda, pamphlets without having complied with the provisions of the ordinance.It is to be noted that both in the American as well as in the Australian Constitutions the. right to freedom ofreligion has been declared in unrestricted terms with. out any limitation whatsoever. Limitations, therefore, havebeen introduced by courts of law in these countries on grounds of morality, order and social protection. Anadjustment of the competing demands of the interests of Government and constitutional liberties is always adelicate and a diﬃcult task and that is why we ﬁnd diﬀerence of judicial opinion to such an extent in cases decidedby the American courts where questions of religious freedom were involved. Our Constitution-makers, however,have embodied the limitations which have been evolved by judicial pronouncements in America or Australia in theConstitution itself and the language of articles 25 and 26 is suﬃciently clear to enable us to determine without theaid of foreign authorities as to what matters come within the purview of religion and what do not. As we havealready indicated, freedom of religion in our Constitution is not conﬁned to religious beliefs only; it extends toreligious practices as well subject to the restrictions which the Constitution itself has laid down. Under article26(b), therefore, a religious denomination .or organization enjoys complete autonomy in the matter of deciding asto what rites and ceremonies are essential according to the tenets of the religion they hold and no outsideauthority has any jurisdiction to (1) [ 1942] USSC 132; 316 U.S. 584.1029 interfere with their decision in such matters. Of course, the scale of expenses to be incurred in connectionwith these religious observances would be a matter of administration of property belonging to the religiousdenomination and can be controlled by secular authorities in accordance with any law laid down by a competentlegislature; for it could not be the injunction, of any religion to destroy the institution and its endowments byincurring wasteful expenditure on rites and ceremonies. It should be noticed, however, that under article 26(d), it isthe fundamental right of a religious denomination or its representative to administer its properties in accordancewith law; and the law, therefore, must leave the right of administration to the religious denomination itself subjectto such restrictions and regulations as it might choose to impose. A law which takes away the right ofadministration from the hands of a religious denomination altogether and vests it in any other authority wouldamount to a violation of the right guaranteed under clause (d) of article 26.Having thus disposed of the general contentions that were raised in this appeal, we will proceed now to examinethe speciﬁc grounds that have been urged by the parties before us in regard to the decision of the High Court so faras it declared several sections of the new Act to be ultra vires the Constitution by reason of their conﬂicting withthe fundamental rights of the respondent. The concluding portion of the judgment of the High Court where thelearned Judges summed up their decision on this point stands as follows:"" To sum up, we hold that the following sections are ultra vires the State Legislature in so far as they relate to thisMath: and what we say will also equally apply to other Maths of a similar nature. The sections of the new Act are:sections 18, 209 21, 25(4), section 26 (to the extent section 25(4) is made applicable), section 28 (though it soundsinnocuous, it is liable to abuse as we have already pointed out earlier in the judgment), section 29, clause- (2) ofsection 30, section 31, section 39(2), section 42, section 53 (because courts have ample powers to meet thesecontingencies), ,section 54, clause (2) of section 55, section 56, clause (3) 133 1030 of section 58, sections to 69 inChapter VI, clauses (2), (3) and (4) of section 70, section 76, section 89 and section 99 (to the extent it gives theGovernment virtually complete control over the Matadhipati and Maths).www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951118 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …It may be pointed out at the outset that the learned Judges were not, right in including sections 18, 39(2) and 42 inthis list, as these sections are not applicable to Maths under the Act itself This position has not been disputed byMr. Somayya, who appears for the respondent.Section 20 of the Act describes the powers of the Commissioner in respect to religious endowments and theyinclude power to pass any orders that may be deemed necessary to ensure that such endowments are properlyadministered and that their income is duly appropriated for the purposes for which they were founded. Havingregard to the fact that the Mathadhipati occupies the position of a trustee with regard to the Math, which is apublic institution, some amount of control or supervision over the due administration of the endowments and dueappropriation of their funds is certainly necessary in the interest of the public and we do not think that theprovision of this section by itself oﬀends any fundamental right of the Mahant. We do not agree with the HighCourt that the result of this provision would be to reduce the Mahant to the position of a servant. No doubt theCommissioner is invested, with powers to pass orders, but orders can be passed only for the purposes speciﬁed inthe section and not for interference with the rights of the Mahant as are sanctioned by usage or for lowering hisposition as the spiritual head of the institution. The saving provision contained in section 91 of the Act makes theposition quite clear. An apprehension that the powers conferred by this section may be abused in individual casesdoes not make the provision itself bad or invalid in law.We agree, however, with the High Court in the view taken by it about section 21. This section empowers theCommissioner and his subordinate oﬃcers and also persons authorised by them to enter the premises of 1031 anyreligious institution or place of worship for the purpose of exercising any power conferred, or any duty imposed byor under the Act. It is well known that there could be no such thing as an unregulated and unrestricted right ofentry in a public temple or other religious institution, for persons who are not connected with the spiritualfunctions thereof. It is a traditional custom universally observed not to allow access to any outsider to theparticularly sacred parts of a temple as for example, the place where the deity is located. There are also ﬁxed hoursof worship and rest for the idol when no disturbance by any member of the public is allowed. Section 21, it is to benoted, does not conﬁne the right of entry to the outer portion of the premises; it does not even exclude the innersanctuary the Holy of Holies"" as it is said, the sanctity of which is zealously preserved. It does not say that the entrymay be made after due notice to the head. of.the institution and at such hours which would not interfere with the due observance of the rites and ceremonies inthe institution. We think that as the section stands, it interferes with the fundamental rights of the Mathadhipatiand the denomination of which he is head guaranteed under articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. Our attentionhas been drawn in. this connection to section 91. of the Act which, it is said, provides a suﬃcient -safeguardagainst any abuse of power under section 2 1. We cannot agree with this contention. Clause (a ) of section 91excepts from the saving clause all express provisions of the Act within which the provision of section 21 would haveto be included.Clause (b) again does not say anything about custom or usage obtaining in an institution and it does not indicateby whom and in what manner the question of interference with the, religious and spiritual functions of the Mathwould be decided in case of any dispute arising regarding it. In our opinion, section 21 has been rightly held to beinvalid.Section 23 imposes a duty upon the trustees to obey all lawful orders issued be the Commissioner or anysubordinate authority under the, provisions of the Act. No exception can be taken to the section if those 1032provisions of the Act, which oﬀend against the fund&mental rights of the respondent, are left out of account asbeing invalid. No body can make a grievance if he .is directed to obey orders issued in pursuance of valid legalauthority.The same reason would, in our opinion, apply to section 24.It may be mentioned here that sections 23 and 24 have not been speciﬁcally mentioned in the concluding portionof the judgment of the High Court set out above, though they have been attacked by the learned Judges in courseof their discussion.As regards section 25, the High Court has taken exception only to clause (4) of the section. If the preparation ofregisters for religious institutions is not wrong and does not aﬀect the fundamental rights of the Mahant,one failsto see how the direction for addition to or alteration of entries in such registers, which clause (4) contemplates andwhich will be necessary as a result of enquiries made under clause (3), can, in any sense, be held to be invalid aswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951218 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …infringing the fundamental rights of the Mahant. The enquiry that is contemplated by clauses (3) and (4) is anenquiry into the actual state of aﬀairs, and the whole object of the section is to keep an accurate record of theparticulars speciﬁed in it. We are unable, therefore, to agree with the view expressed by the learned Judges. Forthe same reasons, section 26, which provides for annual veriﬁcation of the registers, cannot be held to be bad.According to the High Court section 28 is itself innocuous.The mere possibility of its being abused is no ground for holding it to be invalid. As all endowed properties are.ordinarily inalienable, we fail to see why the restrictions placed by Section 29 upon alienation of endowedproperties should be considered bad. In our opinion, the provision of clause (2) of section 29, which enables theCommissioner to impose conditions when he grants sanction to alienation of endowed property, is perfectlyreasonable and to that no exception can be taken.The provision of section 30(2) appears to us to be somewhat obscure. Clause (1) of the section enables 1033 atrustee to incur expenditure out of the funds in his charge after making adequate provision . for the purposesreferred to in section 70(2), for making arrangements for the health, safety and convenience of disciples, pilgrims,etc. Clause (2), however, says that in incurring expenditure under clause (1), the trustee shall be guided by suchgeneral or special instruction as the Commissioner or the Area Committee might give in that connection. If thetrustee is to be guided but not fettered by such directions, possibly no objection can be taken to this clause; but ifhe is bound to carry out such instructions, we do think that it constitutes an encroachment on his right. Under thelaw, as it stands, the Mahant has large powers of disposal over the surplus income and the only restriction is thathe cannot spend anything out of it for his personal use unconnected with the dignity of his ,oﬃce. But as thepurposes speciﬁed in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of section 30(1) are beneﬁcial to the institution there seems to be noreason why the authority vested in the Mahant to spend the surplus income for such purposes should be takenaway from-him and he should be compelled to act in such matters under the instructions of the Governmentoﬃcers. We think that this is an unreasonable restriction on the Mahant's right of property which is blended withhis oﬃce.The same reason applies in our opnion to section 31 of the Act, the meaning of -which also is far from clear. If aftermaking adequate provision for the purposes referred, to in section 70(2) and for, the arrangements mentioned insection 30(2) there is still a surplus left with the trustee, section 31 enables him to spend it for the purposesspeciﬁed in section 59(1) with the previous sanction of the Deputy Commissioner. One of the purposes mentionedin section 59(1) is the propagation of the religious tenents of the institution, and it, is not understood why sanctionof the Deputy Commissioner should be necessary for spending the surplus, income for the propagation of thereligious tenets of the order which is one of the primary duties of a Mahant to discharge. The next thing thatstrikes one is, whether sanction is necessary if the trustee 1034 wants to spend the money for purposes other thanthose speciﬁed in section 59(1) ? If the answer is in the nega- tive, the whole object of the section becomesmeaningless.If, on the other hand, the implication of the section is that the surplus can be spent only for the purposes speciﬁedin section 59(1) and that too with the permission of the Deputy Commissioner, it undoubtedly places aburdensome restriction upon the property rights of the Mahant which are sanctioned by usage and which wouldhave the eﬀect of impairing his dignity and eﬃciency as the head of the institution. We think that sections 30(2)and 31 have been rightly held to be invalid by the High Court.Sections 39 and 42, as said already, are not applicable to Maths and hence can be left out of consideration,.,Section 53 has . been condemned by the - High Court merely on the ground that the court has ample jurisdiction toprovide for the contingencies that this section is intended to meet. But that surely cannot prevent a competentlegislature from legislating on the topic, provided it can do so without violating"" any of the fundamental rightsguaranteed by the Constitution. We are unable to agree with the High Court on this point. There seems to benothing wrong or unreasonable in section 54 of the Act which provides for ﬁxing the standard, scale ofexpenditure. The proposals for this purpose would have to be submitted by the trustee ; they are then to bepublished and suggestions invited from persons having interest in the amendment. The Commissioner is toscrutinise the original proposals and the . suggestions received and if in his opinion a modiﬁcation of the scale isnecessary, he has to submit a report to the Government, whose decision will be ﬁnal.This we consider to be -quite a reasonable and salutary provision.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951318 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …Section 55 deals with a Mahant's power over Pathakanikas or personal gifts. Ordinarily a Mahant has absolutepower of disposal over such gifts, though if he dies without making any disposition, it is reckoned as the propertyof the Math and goes to the succeeding Mahant. The ﬁrst clause of section 55 lays down that such Pathakanikasshall be spent only for the 1035 purposes of the Math. This is an unwarranted restriction on the property right ofthe Mahant. It may be that according to customs prevailing in a particular institution, such personal gifts areregarded as gifts to the institution itself and the Mahant receives them only as the representative of theinstitution; but the general rule is otherwise. As section 55(1) does not say that this rule will apply only when thereis a custom of that nature in a particular institution, we must say that the provision in this unrestricted form is anunreasonable encroachment upon the, fundamental right of the Mahant. The same objection can be raised againstclause (2) of the section; for if the Pathakanikas constitute the property of a Mahant, there is no justiﬁcation forcompelling him to keep accounts of the receipts and expenditure of such personal gifts. As said already, if theMahant dies without disposing of these personal gifts, they may form part of the assets of the Math, but that is noreason for -restricting the powers of the Mahant over these gifts so long as he is alive.Section 56 has been rightly invalidated by the High Court., It makes provision of an extremely drastic ,character.Power has been given to the Commissioner to require the trustee to appoint a manager for administration of thesecular aﬀairs of the institution and in case of default, the Commissioner can make the appointment. himself.The manager thus appointed -though nominally a servant of the trustee, has practically to do everything accordingto the directions of .the Commissioner and his subordinates.It is to be noted that this power can be exercised at the mere option of the Commissioner without, any justifyingnecessity whatsoever and no pre-requisites like mis- management of property or maladministration of trust fundsare necessary to enable the trustee to exercise such drastic power. It is true that the section contemplates theappointment of a manager for administration of the secular aﬀairs of this institution. But no rigid demarcationcould be made as we have already said between the spiritual duties of the Mahant 1036 and his personal interest inthe trust property. The eﬀect of the section really is that the Commissioner is at liberty at any moment he choosesto deprive the Mahant of his right to administer the trust property even if there is no negligence ormaladministration on his part. Such restriction would be opposed to the provision of article 26(d) of theConstitution. It would cripple his authority as Mahant altogether and reduce his position to that of an ordinarypriest or paid servant.We ﬁnd nothing wrong in section 58 of the Act which relates to the framing of the scheme by the DeputyCommissioner. It is true that it is a Government oﬃcer and not the court who is given the power to settle thescheme, but we think that sample safeguards have been provided in the Act to rectify any error or unjust decisionmade by the Deputy Commissioner. Section 61 provides for an appeal to the Commissioner, against the order ofthe Deputy Commissioner and -there is a right of suit given to a party who is aggrieved by the order of theCommissioner ,with a further right of appeal to the High Court.The objection urged against the provision of clause (3)(b) of section 58 does not appear to us to be of Theexecutive oﬃcer mentioned in much substance that clause could be nothing else but a manager of the propertiesof the Math, ad the cannot possibly be empowered to exercise the functions of the Mathadhipati himself. In anyevent, the trustee would have his remedy against such order of the Deputy Commissioner by way of appeal to theCommissioner and also by way of suit as laid down in sections 61 and 62.Section 59 simply provides a scheme for the application of the cy pres doctrine in case the object of the trust failseither from the inception or by reason of subsequent eve*.Here again the only complaint that is raised is, that such order could be made by the Deputy Commissioner. -Wethink that this objection has not much substance. In the ﬁrst place, the various objects on, which the trust fundscould be spent are laid down in the section itself and the jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioner is only to make achoice out of the several heads-.1037 Further an appeal has been provided from an order of the Deputy Commissioner under this section to theCommissioner.We, therefore, cannot agree with the High Court that sections 58 and 59 of the Act are invalid.Chapter VI of the Act, which contains sections 63 to 69, relates to notiﬁcation of religious institutions Theprovisions are extremely drastic in, their character and the worst feature of it is that no access is allowed to thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951418 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …court to set aside an order of notiﬁcation. The Advocate- General for Madras frankly stated that he could notsupport the legality of these provisions. We hold therefore, in agreement with High Court that these sectionsshould. be hold to be void.Section 70 relates to the, budget of religious institu- tions. Objection has been taken- only to clause (3.) whichempowers the Commissioner and the Area Committee to make any additions to or alterations in the budget asthey deem ﬁt.A budget is indispensable in all public institutions and we do not think that it is per be unreasonable to provide forthe budget of a religious institution being prepared under the supervision of the Commissioner or the AreaCommittee.It is to be noted that if the order is made by an Area Committee under clause (3), clause (4) provides an appealagainst it to the Deputy Commissioner.Section 89 provides for penalties for refusal by the trustee to comply with the provisions of the Act. If theobjectionable portions of the Act are eliminated, the portion that remains will be perfectly valid and for violationof these valid provisions, penalties can legiti- mately be -provided. Section 99 vests an overall revisional power inthe Government. This, in our opinion, is beneﬁcial to the trustee, for he will have an opportunity to approach, theGovernment in case of an irregularity, error or omission made by the Commissioner or any other subordinateoﬃcer.The only other point that requires consideration is the constitutional validity of section 76 of the Act which runs asfollows:""76. (1) In respect of the services rendered by the Government and their oﬃcers, every religious institution shall,from the income derived by it, pay to the 134 1038 Government annually such contribution not exceeding ﬁve percentum of its income as may be prescribed.(2)Every religious institution, the annual income of which for the fasli year immediately preceding as calculated forthe purposes of the levy of contribution under sub- section (1), is hot less than one thousand rupees, shall pay tothe Government annually, for meeting the cost of auditing its accounts, such further sum not exceeding one and ahalf per centum of its income as the Commissioner may determine.(3)The annual payments referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be made, notwithstanding anything to thecontrary contained in any scheme settled or deemed to be settled under this Act for the religious institutionconcerned.(4)The Government shall pay the salaries, allowances, pensions and other beneﬁcial remuneration of theCommissioner, Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners and other oﬃcers and servants (other thanexecutive oﬃcers of religious institutions) employed for the purposes of this Act and the other expenses incurredfor such purposes, including the expenses of Area Committees and the cost of auditing the accounts of religiousinstitutions."" Thus the section authorises the levy of an annual contribution on all religious institutions, themaximum of which is ﬁxed at 5 per cent. of the income derived by them.The -Government is to frame rules for the purposes of ﬁxing rates within the permissible maximums and thesection expressly states that the levy is in respect of the I services rendered by the Government and its oﬃcers.The validity of the provision has been attacked on a two-fold ground: the ﬁrst is, that the contribution is really atax and as such it was beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature to enact such provision. Theother is, that the contribution being a tax or imposition, the proceeds of which are speciﬁcally appropriated for themaintenance of a particular religion or religious denomination, it comes within the mischief of article 27 of theConstitution and is hence void.1039 So far as the ﬁrst ground is concerned, it is not disputed that the legislation in the present case is covered by -entries 10 and 28 of List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution. If the contribution payable under section 76 of theAct is a ""fee"", it may come under entry 47 of the Concurrent List which deals with "" fees"" in respect of any of thematters included in that list. On the other hand, if it is a tax, as this particular tax has not been provided for in anyspeciﬁc entry in any of the three lists, it could come only under entry 97 of List I or article 248(1) of the Constitutionand in either view the Union Legislature alone would be competent to legislate upon it. On behalf of the appellant,the contention raised is that the contribution levied is a fee and not a tax and the learned Attorney General, whowww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951518 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …appeared for the Union of India as intervener in this as well as in the other connected appeals made a strenuousattempt to support this, position. The point is certainly not free from doubt and requires careful consideration.The learned Attorney-General has argued in the ﬁrst place that our Constitution makes a clear distinction,between taxes and fees. It is true, as be t has pointed out, that there are a number of entries in List I of theSeventh Schedule which relate to taxes and duties of various sorts; whereas the last entry, namely entry 96,speaks of ""fees"" in respect of any of the matters dealt with in the list. Extractly the same is with regard to entries46 to 62 in List II all of which relate to taxes and here again the last entry deals only with ""fees"" leviable in respectof the diﬀerent matters speciﬁed in the list. It appears that:articles II 0 and 1 19 of the Constitution which deal with ""Money Bills"" lay down expressly that a bill will not bedeemed to be a ""Money Bill"" by reason only that it provides for the imposition of ﬁnes......... or for the demand orpayment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered, whereas a bill dealing with imposition or regulation. of atax will always be a Money Bill. Article 277 also mentions taxes, cesses and fees separately. It is not clear, how-ever, whether the word ""tax"" as used in article 265 has not been used in the wider sense as including all other 1040impositions like ceases and fees; and that at least seems to be the implication of clause (28) of article 366 whichdeﬁnes taxation as including the imposition of any tax or impost, whether general, local or special. It seems to usthat though levying of fees is only a particular form of the exercise of the taxing power of the State, ourConstitution has placed fees uder a separate category for purposes of legislation and at the end of each one of thethree legislative lists, it has given a power to the particular legislature to legislate on the imposition of fees inrespect to every one of the items dealt with in the list itself. Some idea as to what fees are may be gathered fromclause (2) of articles 110 and 119 referred to above which speak of fees for licences and for services rendered. Thequestion for our consideration really is, what are the indicia or special characteristics that distinguish a fee from atax proper ? On this point we have been referred to several authorities by the learned counsel appearing for thediﬀerent parties including opinions expressed by writers of recognised treatises on public ﬁnance.A neat deﬁnition of what ""tax"" means has been given by Latham C. J. of the High Court of Australia,in Matthews v.Chicory Marketing Board(1). A tax"", according to the learned Chief Justice, ""is a compulsory exaction of money bypublic authority for public purposes enforceable by law and is not payment for services rendered"". This deﬁnitionbrings out, in our opinion, the esential characteristics of a tax as distinguished from other forms of impositionwhich, in a general sense, are included within it. It is said that the essence of taxation is compulsion, that is to say,it is imposed under statutory power without the taxpayer's consent and the payment is enforced by law(2). Thesecond characteristic of tax is that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference to any specialbeneﬁt to be conferred on the payer of the tax.This is expressed by saying that the levy of tax is for the purposes ofgeneral revenue, which when collected revenues of the State. As the (1) [ 1938] HCA 38; 60 C.L.R. 263, 276.(2) Vide Lower Mainland Dairy v. Crystal Dairy Ltd. [ 1933] A.C. 168.1041 object of a tax is not to confer any special beneﬁt upon any particular individual, there is, as it is said, noelement of quid pro quo between the taxpayer and the public authority(1). Another feature of taxation it; that as itis a part of the common burden, the quantum of imposition upon the taxpayer depends generally upon hiscapacity to pay.Coming now to fees, a 'fee' is generally deﬁned to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by somegovernmental agency. The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by theGovernment in rendering the service, though in many cases the costs are arbitrarily assessed. Ordinarily, the feesare uniform and no account is taken of the vary abilities of diﬀerent recipients to pay(2). These are undoubtedlysome of the general characteristics, but as there may be various kinds of fees, it is not possible to formulate adeﬁnition that would be applicable to all cases.As regards the distinction between a tax and a fee, it, is argued in the ﬁrst place on behalf of the respondent that afee is something voluntary which a person has got to pay if he -wants certain' services from the Government; butthere is no obligation on his part to seek such services and if he does not want the services, I he can avoid theobligation. The example given is of a licence fee. If a man wants a licence that is entirely his own choice and thenonly he has to pay the fees, but not otherwise. We think that a careful examination will reveal that the element ofcompulsion or coerciveness is present in all kinds of imposition. though in diﬀerent degrees and that it is nottotally absent in fees. This, therefore, cannot be made the sole or even a material criterion for distinguishing a taxfrom fees. It is diﬃcult, we think, to conceive of a tax except it be something like a poll tax, the incidence of whichwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951618 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …falls on all persons within a State. The house tax has to be paid only by those who own houses, the land tax bythose who possess lands, municipal taxes or rates will fall on those who have properties within a (1) see FindlayShirras on ""Science of Public Finance"", Vol. 1, P. 203.(2) Vide Lutz on ""Public Finance"" p. 215.1042 municipality. Persons who do not have houses,land or Properties within municipalities, would not have to paythese taxes, but nevertheless these impositions come within the category of taxes and nobody can say that it is achoice of these people to own lands or houses or speciﬁed kinds of properties so that there is no compulsion onthem to pay taxes at all. Compulsion lies in the fact that payment is enforceable by law against a man in spite of hisunwillingness or want of consent ; and this element is present in taxes as well as in fees. Of course, in some caseswhether a man would come. within the category Of a service receiver may- be a matter of his choice, but that byitself would not constitute a major test which can be taken as the criterion of this species of imposition. Thedistinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is levied he a part of a common burden, whilea fee is a payment for a special beneﬁt or privilege.Fees confer a special capacity, although the special advan- tage, as for example in the case of registration fees fordocuments or marriage licences, is secondary to the primary motive of regulation in the public interest(1). Publicinterest seems to be at the basis of all impositions but in a fee it is some special beneﬁt which the individualreceives. As seligman says it is the, special beneﬁt accruing to the indivitual which is the reason for payment in thecase of fees; in the case of a tax, the particular advantage if it; exists at all is an incidental result of State action(2).If, as we hold, a fee is regarded as a sort of return or consideration for services rendered, it is absolutely necessarythat the levy of fees should, on the face of the legislative provision, be co-related to the expenses incurred byGovernment in rendering the services. As indicated in article 1 10 of the Constitution ordinarily there are twoclasses of cases where Government imposes fees upon persons. In the ﬁrst class of cases, Government simplygrants a permission or privilege to a person to do something, which otherwise that person would not becompetent to do and extracts fees either (1) Vide Findlay Shirras on ""Science of Public Finance"" Vol. 1, P. 202 (2)Vide Seligman's Essays on Taxation, P. 408.1043 heavy or moderate from that person in return for the privilege that is conferred.; A most common illustrationof this type of cases is furnished. by the licence fees for motor vehicles. Here the costs incurred by the Governmentin maintaining an oﬃce or bureau for the granting of licences may be very small and the amount of imposition thatis levied is based really not upon the costs incur. red by the Government but upon the beneﬁt that the individualreceives. In such cases, according to all the writers on public ﬁnance, the tax element is predominant(1), and if themoney paid by licence holders goes for the upkeep of roads and other matters of general public utility, the licencefee cannot but be regarded as a tax.In the other class of cases,- the Government does some positive work for the beneﬁt of persons and the money istaken as the return for the work done or services rendered.If the money thus paid is set apart and appropriated speciﬁcally for the performance of such work and is notmerged in the public revenues for the beneﬁt of the general public,, it could be counted as fees and not a tax.There is really no generic diﬀerence between the tax and fees and as said by Seligman, the taxing power of a Statemay manifest itself in three diﬀerent forms known respectively as special assessments,fees and taxes(2). .Our Constitution has, for legislative purposes, made a distinction between a tax and a fee and while there arevarious entries in the legislative lists with regard to various forms of taxes there is an entry at the end of each oneof the three lists as regards fees which could be levied in respect of any of the matters that is included in it.The implication seems to be that fees have special reference to governmental action undertaken in respect to anyof these matters.Section 76 of the Madras Act speaks deﬁnitely of the contribution being levied in respect rendered by theGovernment; so far it has the appearance of fees. It is true that religious institutions do not want these services tobe rendered to them and it (1) Vide Spligman's Essays on Taxation, p. 409 (2) lbid, P. 406, 1044 may be that they donot consider the State interference to be a beneﬁt at all. We agree, however, with the learned Attorney-Generalthat, in the present day concept of a State, it cannot be said that services could be rendered by the State only atthe request of those who require these -services. lf in the larger,interest of the public, a State considers it desirablethat some special service should be done for certain people, the people must accept these services, whetherwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/020951718 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …willing or not(1) It may be noticed, however, that the contribution that has been levied under section 76 of the Acthas been made to depend upon the capacity of the payer and not upon the quantum of beneﬁt that is supposed tobe conferred on any particular religious institution. Further the institutions,, which come under the lower incomegroup and have income less than Rs. 1,000 annually, are excluded from the liability to pay the additional chargesunder clause (2) of the section. These are undoubtedly some of the characteristics of a 'tax' and the impositionbears a close analogy to income-tax. But the material fact which negatives the theory of fees in the present case isthat the money raised by levy of the contribution is not ear-marked or speciﬁed for defraying the expenses thatthe Government has to incur in performing the services. -All the collections go to the consolidated fund of theState and all the expenses have to be met not out of these collections but out of the general revenues by a propermethod of appropriation as is done in case of other Government expenses. That in itself might not be conclusive,but in this case there is total absences of any co-relation between the expenses incurred by the Government andthe amount raised by contribution under the provision of section 76 and in these circumstances the theory of areturn or counter-payment or quid pro quo cannot have any possible application to this case. In our opinion,therefore, the High Court was right in holding that the contribution levied under section 76 is a tax and not a feeand consequently it was beyond the power of the State Legislature to enact this provision.(1) Vide Findlay Shirras on ""Science of Public Finance"" Vol. 1, P. 202.1045 In view of our decision on this point, the other ground hardly requires consideration. We will indicate,however, very brieﬂy our opinion on the second point raised. The ﬁrst contention, which has been raised by Mr.Nambiar in reference to article 27 of the Constitution is that the word ""taxes"", as used therein, is not conﬁned totaxes proper but is inclusive of all other impositions like cesses, fees, etc. We do not think it necessary to decidethis point in the present case, for in our opinion on the facts of the present case, the imposition, although it is atax, does not come within the purview of the latter part of the article at all. What is forbidden by the article is thespeciﬁc appropriation of the proceeds of any tax in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of anyparticular religion or religious denomination. The reason underlying this provision is obvious. Ours being a secularState and there being freedom of religion guaranteed by the Constitution, both to individuals and to groups, it isagainst the policy of the ,Constitution to pay out of public funds any money for the promotion or maintenance ofany particular religion or religious denomination. But the object of the contribution under section 76 of the MadrasAct is not the fostering or preservation of the Hindu religion or any denomination within it. The purpose is to seethat religious trusts and institutions,, wherever they exist, are properly administered. It is a secular administrationof the religious legislature seeks to control and the in the Act, is to ensure that the institutions that the object, asenunciated endowments attached to the religious institutions are properly administered and their income is dulyappropriated for the purposes for which they were founded or exist. There is no qustion of favouring any particularreligion or religious denomination in such cases . In our opinion, article 27 of the Constitution is not attracted to thefacts of the present case.The result, therefore, is that in our opinion sections 21, 30(2), 31,55,56 and 63 to 69 arethe only sections which should be declared invalid as conﬂicting with the fundamental rights of the respondent asMathadhipati of the Math in question and 135 1046 section 76(1) is void as beyond the legislative competence ofthe Madras State Legislature. The rest of the Act is to be regarded as valid. The decision of the High Court will bemodiﬁed to this extent, but as the judgment of the High Court is aﬃrmed on its merits, the appeal will standdismissed with costs to the respondent.Appeal dismissed.Civil Appeal No. 38 of 1953.Appeal under article 132(1) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated the 13th December,1951, of the High Court of Judicature, Madras, in Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 2591 of 1951.1007 V.K.T.

Itmay be stated at the outset that the petition was ﬁled at a time when the Madras Hindu Religion Endowments Act(Act II of 1927), was in force and the writ was prayed for against the Hindu Religious Endowments Boardwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095218 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …constituted under that Act, which -was the predecessor in authority of the present appellant and had initiatedproceedings for settlement of a scheme against the petitioner under section 61 of the said Act.The petition was directed to be heard along with two other petitions of a similar nature relating to the temple atChidambaram in the district of South Arcot and questions were raised in all of them regarding the validity ofMadras Act 11 of 1927, hereinafter referred to as the Earlier Act.While the petitions were still pending, the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act,, 1951(hereinafter called the New Act), was passed by the Madras Legislature and came into force on the 27th of August,1951. In view of the Earlier Act being replaced by the new one,, leave was given to all the petitioners to amendtheir petitions and challenge the validity of the. New Act as well.1008 Under section 103 of the New Act, notiﬁcations, orders and acts under the Earlier Act are to be treated asnotiﬁcations, orders and acts issued, made or done by the appropriate, authority under the correspondingprovisions of the New Act, and in accordance with this -provision, the Commissioner, Hindu ReligiousEndowments, Madras, who takes the place of the President, ""Hindu Religious Endowments Board under theEarlier Act, was added as a party to the proceedings.So far as the present appeal is concerned, the material facts may be shortly narrated as follows: The Math, knownas Shirur Math, of which the petitioner is the superior or Mathadhipati, is one of the eight Maths situated at Udipiin the district of South Kanara and they are reputed to have been founded by Shri Madhwacharya, the well-knownexponent of dualistic theism in the Hindu Religion. Besides these eight Maths, each one of which is presided overby a Sanvasi or Swami, there exists another ancient religious institution at Udipi, known as Shri Krishna DevaraMath, also established by Madhwacharya which is supposed to contain an image of God Krishna originally madeby Arjun and miraculously obtained from a vessel wrecked at the coast of Tulava. There is no Mathadhipati in theShri Krishna Math and its. aﬀairs are managed by the superiors of the other eight Maths by turns and the custom isthat the Swami of each of these eight Maths presides over the Shri Krishna Math in turn for a period of two yearsin every sixteen years. The appointed time of change in the headship of the Shri Krishna Math is the occasion of agreat festival, known as Pariyayam, when a vast concourse of devotees gather at Udipi from all parts of SouthernIndia, and an ancient usage imposes a duty upon the Mathadhipati to feed every Brahmin that comes to the placeat that time.The petitioner was installed as Mathadhipati in the year 1919, when he was still a minor, and he assumedmanagement after coming of age some time in 1926. At that time the Math was heavily in debt. Between 1926and 1930 the Swami succeeded in clearing oﬀ a large portion of the debt. In 1931, however, came the 1009 turn ofhis taking over management of the Shri Krishna Math and he had had to incur debts to meet the heavyexpenditure attendant on the Pariyayam ceremonies, The ﬁnancial position improved to some extent during theyears that followed, but troubles again arose in 1946, which was the year of the second Pariyayam of the Swami.Owing to scarcity and the high prices of commodities at that time, the Swami had to borrow money to meet theexpenditure and the debts mounted up to nearly a lakh of rupees. The Hindu Religious Endowments Board,functioning under the Earlier Act of 1927, intervened at this stage and in exercise of its powers under section 61 -Aof the Act called upon the Swami to appoint a competent manager to manage the aﬀairs of the institution. Thepetitioners case is that the action of the Board was in stigated by one Lakshminarayana Rao, a lawyer of Udipi,who wanted to have control over the aﬀairs of the Math. It appears that in pursuance of the direction of the Board,one Sripath Achar was appointed an agent and a Power of Attorney was executed in his favour on the 24th ofDecember, 1948. The agent, it is alleged by the petitioner, wanted to have his own way in all the aﬀairs of the Mathand paid no regard whatsoever to the wishes of the Mahant.He did not even submit accounts to the Mahant and deliberately ﬂouted his authority. In this state of aﬀairs theSwami,, on the 26th of September, 1950, served a notice upon the agent terminating his agency and calling uponhim to hand over to the Mathadhipati all account papers and vouchers relating to the institution together with thecash in hand. Far from complying with this demand, the agent, who was supported by the aforesaidLakshminarayans Rao, questioned the authority of the Swami to cancel his agency and threatened that he wouldrefer the matter for action to the Board. On the 4th of October, 1950, the petitioner ﬁled a suit against the agent inthe Sub,Court of South Kanara for recovery of the account books and other articles belonging to the Math, forrendering an account of the management and also for an injunction restraining the said agent from interferingwith the aﬀairs of the Math under colour of the 1010 authority conferred by the Power of Attorney which theplaintiﬀ had cancelled. The said Sripath Achar anticipating this suit ﬁled an application to the Board on the 3rd ofOctober, 1950, complaining against the cancellation of the Power of Attorney and his management of the Math.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095318 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …The Board on the 4th October, 1950, issued a notice to the Swami proposing to inquire into the matter on the 24thof October following at 2 p.m. at Madras and requesting the Swami either to apppear in person or by a pleader. Tothis the Swami sent a reply on 21st October, 1950, stating that the subject-matter of the very enquiry was beforethe court in the original suit ﬁled by him and as the matter was sub judice the enquiry should be put oﬀ.A copy of the plaint ﬁled in that suit was also sent along with the reply. The Board, it appears, dropped thatenquiry, but without waiting for the result of the suit, initiated proceedings suo moto under section 62 of theEarlier Act and issued a notice upon the Swami on the 6th of November, 1950, stating that it had reason to believethat the endowments of the said Math were being mismanaged and that a scheme should be framed for theadministration of its aﬀairs. . The notice was served by aﬃxture on the Swami and the 8th of December, 1950, wasﬁxed as the date of enquiry. On that date at the request of the counsel for the Swami, it was adjourned to the 21stof December, following.On the 8th of December, 1950, an application was ﬁled on behalf of the Swami praying to the Board to issue adirection to the agent to hand over the account papers and other documents, without which it was not possible forhim to ﬁle his objections As the lawyer appearing for the Swami was unwell, the matter was again adjourned tillthe 10th of January, 1951. The Swami was not ready with his objections even on that date as his lawyer had no trecovered from his illness and a telegram was sent to the Board on the previous day requesting the latter to granta further adjournment.The Board did not accede to this request and as no explanation was ﬁled by the Swami, the enquiry was closed andorders reserved upon it. On the 13th of January, 1951, the Swami, it appears sent a written 1011 explanation to theBoard, which the latter admittedly received on the 15th On the 24th of January, 1951, the Swami received a noticefrom the Board stating inter alia that the Board was satisﬁed that in the,, interests of proper administration of theMath and its endowments, the settlement of a scheme was necessary. A draft scheme was sent along with thenotice and if the petitioner had any objections to the same, he was required to send in his objections on or beforethe 11th of February, 1951, as the.ﬁnal order regarding the scheme would be made on the 15th of February, 1951. On the 12th of February, 1951, thepeti- tioner ﬁled the petition, out of which this appeal arises, in the High Court of Madras, praying for a writ ofprohibition to prohibit the Board from taking further steps in the matter of settling a scheme for theadministration of the Math. It was alleged inter alia that the Board was actuated by bias against the petitioner andthe action taken by it with regard to the settling of a scheme was not a bona ﬁde act at all. The main contention,however, was that having regard to the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution in matters ofreligion and religious institutions belonging to particular religious denominations, the law regulating the framingof a scheme interfering with the management of the Math and its aﬀairs by the Mathadhipati conﬂicted with theprovisions of art- icles 19(1) (f) and 26 of the Constitution and was hence void under article 13. It was allegedfurther that the provisions of the Act were discriminatory in their character and oﬀended against article 15 of theConstitution. As has been stated already, after the New Act came into force, the petitioner was allowed to end hispetition and the attack was now directed against the constitutional validity of the New Act which replaced theearlier legislation.The learned Judges, who heard the petition, went into the matter with elaborate fullness, both on theconstitutional questions involved in it as well as on its merits. On the merits, it was held that in the circumstancesof the case the action of the Board was a perverse exercise of its jurisdiction and that it should 1012 not be allowedto proceed in regard to the settlement of the scheme. On the constitutional issues raised in the case, the learnedJudges pronounced quite a number of sections of the New Act to be ultra vires the Constitution by reason of theirbeing in conﬂict with the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under articles 19(1)(f), 25, 26 and 27 ofthe Constitution. In the result, the rule nisi issued on the petition was made absolute and the Commissioner, HinduReligious Endowments, Madras, was prohibited from proceeding further with the framing of a scheme inregard tothe petitioner's Math. The Commisioner has now come up on appeal before us on the strength of a certiﬁcategranted by the High Court under article 132(1) of the Constitution.The learned Advocate-General for Madras, who appeared in support of the appeal, conﬁned his argumentsexclusively to the constitutional points involved in this case.Although he had put in an application to. urge grounds other than the constitutional grounds, that application wasnot pressed and he did not challen the ﬁndings of fact upon which the High Court based its decision on the meritsof the petition. The position, therefore, is that the order of the High Court issuing the writ of prohibition againstwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095418 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …the appellant must stand irrespective of the decision which we light arrive at on the constitutional points raisedbefore us.It is not disputed that a State Legislature is competent to enact laws on the subject of religious and charitableendowments, which is covered by entry 28 of List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution. No question of legislativeincompetency on the part of the Madras Legislature to enact the legislation in question has been raised before uswith the exception of the provision, relating to payment of annual contribution contained in section 76 of theimpugned Act. The argument that has been advanced is, that the contribution is in reality a tax and not a fee andconsequently the State Legislature had no authority to enact a provision of this character. We will deal with thispoint separately later on. All the other points canvassed 1013 before us relate to the constitutional validity orotherwise of the several provisions of the Act which have been held to be invalid by the High Court of Madras ongrounds of their being in conﬂict with the fundamental rights guaranteed under articles 19(1) (f), 25, 26 and 27 ofthe Constitution.In order to appreciate the contentions that have been advanced on these heads by the learned counsel on bothsides, it may be convenient to refer brieﬂy to the scheme and the salient provisions of the Act.The object of the legislation, as indicated in the preamble, is to amend and consolidate the law relating to theadministration and governance of Hindu religious and charitable institutions and endowments in the State ofMadras. As compared with the Earlier Act, its scope is wider and it can be made applicable to purely charitableendowments by proper notiﬁcation under section 3 of the Act. The Earlier Act provided for supervision of Hindureligious endowments through a statutory body known as the Madras Hindu religious Endowments Board. TheNew Act has abolished this Board and the administration of religious and charitable institutions has been vestedpractically in a department of the Government, at the head of which is the Commissioner. The powers of theCommissioner and of the other authorities under him have been enumerated in Chapter II of the Act. Under theCommissioner are the Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners and Area Committees.The Commissioner, with the approval of the Government, has to divide the State into certain areas and each areais placed in charge of a Deputy Commissioner, to whom the powers of the Commissioner can be delegated. TheState has also to be divided into a number of divisions and an Assistant Commissioner is to be placed in charge ofeach division. Below the Assistant Commissioner, there will be an Area Committee in charge of all the templessituated within a division or part of a division. Under section 18, the Commissioner is empowered to examine therecords of any Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, or Area Committee, or of any trustee not being thetrustee 131 1014 of a, Math, in respect of any proceeding under the Act, to satisfy himself as to the regularity,correctness, or propriety of any decision or order. Chapter III contains the general provisions relating to all religiousinstitutions. Under section 20, the administration of religious endowments is placed under the generalsuperintendence and control of the Commissioner and he is empowered to pass any orders which may be deemednecessary to ensure that such endowments are properly administered and their income is -duly appropriated forthe purposes for which they were founded or exist. Section 21 gives the Commissioner, the Deputy and AssistantCommissioners and such other oﬃcers asmay be authorised in th is behalf, the power to enter the premises of anyreligious institution or any place of worship for the purpose of exercising any power conferred, or discharging anyduty imposed, by or under the Act. The only restriction is that the oﬃcer exercising the power must be a Hindu.Section 23 makes it obligatory on the trustee of a religious institution to obey all lawful orders issued under theprovisions of this Act by the Government, the Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner, the Area Committee orthe Assistant Commissioner. Section 24 lays down that in the administration of the aﬀairs of the institution, atrustee should use as much care as a man of ordinary prudence would use in the management of his own aﬀairs. -Section 25 deals with the preparation of registers of all religious institutions and section 26 provides for the annualveriﬁcation of such registers.Section 27 imposes a duty on the trustee to furnish to the Commissioner such accounts, returns, reports and otherinformation as the Commissioner may require. Under section 28, power is given to the Commissioner or any otheroﬃcer authorised by him to inspect all movable and immovable properties appertaining to a religious institution.Section 29 forbids alienation of all immovable properties belonging to the trust, except leases for a term notexceeding ﬁve -,,ears, without the Sanction of the Commissioner. Section 30 lays down that although a trusteemay incur expenditure for making arrangements for securing the health and 1015 comfort of pilgrims, worshippersand other people, when there is a surplus left after making adequate provision for purposes speciﬁed in section79(2), he shall be guided in such matters by all genera or special instructions which he may receive from theCommissioner or the Area Committee.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095518 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …Section 31 deals with surplus funds which the trustee may apply wholly or in part with the permission in writing, ofthe Deputy Commissioner for any of the purposes speciﬁed in section 59(1). Chapter IV deals speciﬁcally withMaths.Seetion 52 enumerates the grounds on which a suit would lie to remove a trustee. Section 54 relates to what iscalled "" dittam "" or scale of expenditure. The trustee has got to submit to the Commissioner proposals for ﬁxingthe ""dittam"" and the amounts to be allotted to the various objects connected with the institution. The proposalsare to be published and after receiving suggestions, if any, from persons interested in the instution, they would bescrutinised by the Commissioner. If the Commissioner thinks that a modiﬁcation is necessary, he shall submit thecase to the Government and the orders of the Government would be ﬁnal. Section 55 empowers the trustee tospend at his discretion and for purposes connected with the Math the ""Pathakanikas "" or gifts made to himpersonally, but he is required to keep regular accounts of the receipts and expenditure of such personal gifts.Under section 56, the Commissioner is empowered to call upon the trustee to appoint a manager for theadministration of the secular aﬀairs of the institution and in default of such appointment, the Commissioner maymake the appointment himself. Under section 58, a Deputy Commissioner is competent to frame a scheme for anyreligious institutions if he has reason to believe that in the interests of the proper administration of the trust anysuch scheme is necessary. Sub-section (3) of this section provides that a scheme settled for a Math may containinter alia a provision for appointment of a paid executive oﬃcer professing the Hindu religion, whose salary shallbe paid out of the funds- of the institution. Section 59 makes provision for application of the ""cy pres"" doctrinewhen the speciﬁc 1016 objects of the trust fail. Chapter VI of the Act, which comprises sections 63 to 69, deals withthe notiﬁcation of religious institutions. A religious institution may be notiﬁed in accordance with the provisionslaid down in this chapter. Such notiﬁcation remains in force for ﬁve years and the eﬀect of it is to take over theadministration and vest it in an executive oﬃcer appointed by the Commissioner. Chapter VII deals with budgets,accounts and audit and Chapter VIII relates to ﬁnance. Section 76 of Chapter VIII makes it compulsory for allreligious institutions to pay annually to the Government a contribution not exceeding 5 per cent. of their incomeon account of the services rendered to them by the Government and their oﬃcers functioning under this Act.Chapter IX is not material for our purpose, and Chapter X deals with provisions of a miscellaneous nature. Section89 in Chapter X prescribes the penalty for refusal by a trustee to comply with the provisions of the Act. Section 92lays down that nothing contained in the Act shall be deemed to confer any power or. impose any duty incontravention of the rights conferred on any religious denomination under clauses (a), (b) and (c) of article 26 ofthe Constitution. Section 99 vests a revisional jurisdiction in the Government to call for and examine the records ofthe Commissioner and other subordinate authorities to satisfy themselves as to the regularity and propriety of anyproceeding taken or any order or decision made by them These, in brief, are the provisions of the Act material forour present purpose.The learned Judges of the High Court have taken the view that the respondent as Mathadhipati has certain welldeﬁned rights in the institution and its endowments which could be regarded as rights to property within themeaning of article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. The provisions of the Act to the extent that they take away orunduly restrict the power to exercise these rights are not reasonable restrictions within the meaning of article 19(5)and must consequently be held invalid. The High Court has held in the second place that the respondent, as thehead and 1917 representative of a religious institution, has a right guaranteed to him under article 25 of theConstitution to practise and propagate freely the religion of which he and his followers profess to be adherents.This right, in the opinion of the High Court, has been aﬀected by some of the provisions of the Act. The High Courthas held further that the Math in question is really an institution belonging to Sivalli Brahmins, who are a section ofthe followers of Madhwacharya and hence constitutes a religious denomination within the meaning of article 26 ofthe Constitution. This religious denomination has a fundamental right under article 26 to manage its own aﬀairs inmatters of religion through the Mathadhipati who is their spiritual head and superior, and those provisions of theAct, which substantially take away the rights of the Mathadhipati in this respect, amount to violation of thefundamental right guaranteed under article 26. Lastly, the High Court has. held that the provision for compulsorycontribution made in section 76 of the Act comes within the mischief of article 27 of the Constitution. This lastpoint raises a wide issue and We propose to discuss it separately later on. So far as the other three points areconcerned, we will have to examine ﬁrst of all the general contentions that have been raised by the learnedAttorney-General, who appeared for the Union of India as an intervener in this and other connected cases, and thequestions raised are, whether these articles of the Constitution are at all available to the respondent in the presentcase and whether they give him any protection regarding the rights and privileges, of the infraction of which hecomplains.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095618 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …As regards article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution, the question that requires consideration is, whether the respondentas Mathadhipati has a right to property in the legal sense,, in the religious institution and its endowments whichwould enable him to claim the -protection of this article ? A question is also formulated as to whether this articledeals with concrete rights of property at all ? So far as article 25 of the Constitution is concerned, the point raisedis, whether this 1018 article which, it is said, is intended to protect religious freedom only so far as individuals areconcerned, can be invoked in favour of an institution or Organisation ? With regard to article 26, the contention isthat a Math does not come within the description of a religious denomination as provided for in the article andeven if it does, what cannot be interfered with is its right to manage its own aﬀairs in matters of religion only andnothing else. It is said, that the word it religion "", as used in this article, should be taken in its strict etymologicalsense as distinguished from any kind of secular activity which may be connected in some way with religion on butdoes not form an essential part of it. Reference is made in this connection to clause (2)(a) of article 25 and clause(d) of article 26. We will take up these points for consideration one after another.As regards the -property rights of a Mathadhipati, it may not be possible to say in view of the pronouncements ofthe Judicial Committee, which have been accepted as good law in this country ever since 1921, that a Mathadhipatiholds the Math property as a lifetenant or that his position is similar to that of a Hindu widow in respect to herhusband's estate or of an English BishoP holding a beneﬁce. He is certainly not a trustee in the strict sense. He maybe, as the Privy Council(1), says, a manager or custodian, of the institution who has to discharge the duties of atrustee and is answerable as such; but he is not a mere manager and it would not be right to describe Mahantshipas a mere oﬃce."" A superior of a Math has not only duties to discharge in connection with the endowment but hehas a personal interest of a beneﬁcial character which is sanctioned by custom and is much larger than that of aShebait in the debutter property. It was held by a Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court(2), that Shebaitship. itselfis property, and this decision was approved of by the Judicial Committee in Ganesh v Lal Behary(3), and again inBhabatarini v. Ashalata(4).(1) Vide Vidya Varuthi v. Balusami, 48 I. A. 302 (2) Vide Monahai v. Bhupendra, 60 Cal. 452.(3) 63 I.A. 448.(4) 70 I.A. 57.1019 The eﬀect of the ﬁrst two decisions, as the Privy Council pointed out in the last case, was to emphasise thepropriet ary element in the Shebaiti right and to show that though in some respects an anomaly, it was ananomaly to be accepted as having been admitted into Hindu ,law from an early date.This view was adopted in its entirety by this court in Angurbala v. Debabrata (1), and what was said in that case inrespect to Shebaiti right could, with equal propriety, be applied to the oﬃce of a Mahant. Thus in the conceptionof Mahantship, as in Shebaitship, both the elements of oﬃce and property, of duties and personal interest areblended together and neither can be detached from the other.The personal or beneﬁcial interest of the Mahant in the endowments attached to an institution is manifested in hislarge powers of disposal and administration and his right to create derivative tenures in respect to endowedproperties;and these and other rights of a similar character invest the oﬃce of the Mahant with .the character of proprietaryright which, though anomalous to some extent, is still a genuine legal right. It is true that the Mahantship is notheritable like ordinary property, but that is because of its peculiar nature and the fact that the oﬃce is generallyheld by an ascetic, whose connection with his natural family being completely cut of, the ordinary rules ofsuccession do not apply.There is no reason why the word ""property"", as used in article 19(1) (f) of the Constitution, should not be given aliberal and wide connotation and should not be extended to those well recognised types of interest which have theinsignia or characteristics of proprietary right. As said above, the ingredients of both oﬃce and property, of dutiesand personal interest are blended together in the rights of a Mahant and the Mahant has the right to enjoy thisproperty or beneﬁcial interest so long as he is entitled to hold his oﬃce. To take away this beneﬁcial interest andleave him merely to the discharge of his duties would be to destroy his character as a Mahant altogether.It is true that the beneﬁcial interest which he enjoys is appurtenant to his duties (1) [ 1951] S.C.R. 1125.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095718 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …1020 and as he is in charge of a public institution, reasonable restrictions can always be placed upon his rights inthe interest of the public. But the restrictions would cease to be reasonable if they are calculated to make him unﬁtto discharge the duties which he is called upon to discharge.A Mahant's duty is not simply to manage the temporalities of a Math. He is the head and superior of spiritualfraternity and the purpose of Math is to encourage and foster spiritual training by maintenance of a competentline of teachers who could impart religious instructions to the disciples and followers of the Math and try tostrengthen the doctrines of the particular school or order, of which they profess to be adherents. This purposecannot be served if the restrictions are such as would bring the Mathadhipati down to the level of a servant under aState department. It is from this standpoint that the reasonableness of the restrictions should be judged.A point was suggested by the learned AttorneyGeneral that as article 19(1) (f) deals only with the natural rightsinherent in a citizen to acquire, hold and dispose of property in the abstract without reference to rights to anyparticular property, it can be of no real assistance to the respondent in the present case and article 3l of theConstitution, which deals with deprivation of property, has no application here. In the case of The State of WestBengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose(II) (Civil Appeal No. 107 of 1952, decided by this court on the 17th December, 1953),an opinion was expressed by Patanjali Sastri C. J. that article 19(1) (f) of the Constitution is concerned only with theabstract right and capacity to acquire, hold and dispose of property and that it has no relation to concrete propertyrights. This, it may be noted, was an expression of opinion by the learned Chief Justice alone and it was not thedecision of the court ; for out of the other four learned Judges who together with the Chief Justice constituted theBench, two did not deﬁnitely agree with this view, while the remaining two did not express any opinion one way orthe other. This point was not raised before us by the Advocate- General for Madras, who appeared in support ofthe appeal, nor by any of the other (1) (1954] S.C.R. 587 1021 counsel appearing in this case. The learned Attorney.General himself stated candidly that he was not prepared to support the view taken by the late Chief Justice asmentioned above, and he only raised the. point to get an authoritative pronouncement upon it by the court. In ouropinion, it would not be proper to express any ﬁnal opinion upon the point in the present case when we had notthe advantage of any arguments addressed to us upon it. We would prefer to proceed, as this court has proceededall along, in dealing with similar cases in the past, on the footing that article 19(1) (f) applies equally to concrete aswell as abstract rights of property.We now come to article 25 which, as its language indicates, secures to every person, subject to public order, healthand morality, a freedom not only to entertain such religious belief, as may be approved of by his judgment andconscience, but also to exhibit his belief in such outward acts as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminatehis ideas for the ediﬁcation of others. A question is raised as to whether the word ""persons"" here means individualsonly or includes corporate bodies as well. The question, in our opinion, is not at all relevant for our presentpurpose. A Mathadhipati is certainly not a corporate body; he is the head of a spiritual fraternity and by virtue ofhis oﬃce has to perform the duties of a religious teacher. it is his duty to practise and propagate the religioustenets, of which he is an adherent and if any provision of law prevents him from propagating his doctrines, thatwould certainly aﬀect the religious freedom which is guaranteed to every person under article 25. Institutions assuch cannot practise or propagate religion; it can be done only by individual persons and whether these personpropagate their personal views or the tenets for which the institution stands is really immaterial for purposes. ofarticle 25. It is the propagation of belief that is protected, no matter whether the propagation takes place in achurch or monastery, or in a temple or parlour meeting.As regards article 26, the ﬁrst question is, what is the precise meaning or connotation of the expression 132 1022""religious denomination"" and whether a Math could come within this expression. The word ""denomination"" hasbeen deﬁned in the Oxford Dictionary to mean 'Ca collection of individuals classed together under the same name:a religious sect or body having a common faith and Organisation and designated by a distinctive name. It is wellknown that the practice of setting up Maths as centres of the logical teaching was started by Shri Sankaracharyaand was followed by various teachers since then. After Sankara, came a galaxy of religious teachers andphilosophers who founded the diﬀerent sects and sub-sects of the Hindu religion that we ﬁnd in India at thepresent day. Each one of such sects or sub-sects can certainly be balled a religious denomination, as it isdesignated by a distinctive name,-in many cases it is the name of the founder,-and has a common faith andcommon spiritual organization. The followers of Ramanuja, who are known by the name of Shri Vaishnabas,undoubtedly constitute a religious denomination; and so do the followers of Madhwacharya and other religiousteachers. It is a fact well established by tradition that the eight Udipi Maths were founded by Madhwacharyahimself and the trustees and the beneﬁciaries of these Maths profess to be followers of that teacher. The HighCourt has found that the Math in question is in charge of the Sivalli Brahmins who constitute a section of thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/46.html/02095818 9/12/2THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS V. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SW AMIAR OF SRI SHI …followers of Madhwacharya. As article 26 contemplates not merely a religious denomination but also a sectionthereof, the Math or the spiritual fraternity represented by it can legitimately come within the purview of thisarticle.The other thing that remains to be considered in regard to article 26 is, what is the scope of clause (b) of the articlewhich speaks of management "" of its own aﬀairs in matters of religion ?"" The language undoubtedly suggests thatthere could be other aﬀairs of a religious denomination or a section thereof which are not matters of religion andto which the guarantee given by this clause would not apply. The question is, whereas the line to be drawnbetween what are matters of religion and what are not 1023 It will be seen that besides the right to manage itsown aﬀairs in matters of religion, which is given by clause (b), the next two clauses of article 26 guarantee to areligious denomination the right to acquire and own property and to administer such property in accordance withlaw. The administration of its property by a religious denomination has thus been placed on a diﬀerent footingfrom the right to manage its own aﬀairs in matters of religion. The latter is a fundamental right which nolegislature can take away, whereas the former can be regulated by laws which the legislature can validly impose. Itis clear, therefore, that questions merely relating to administration of properties belonging to a religious group orinstitution are not matters of religion to which clause (b) of the article applies. What then are matters of religion ?The word ""religion "" has not been deﬁned in the Constitution and it is a term which is hardly susceptible of anyrigid deﬁnition. In an American case(1), it has been said "" that the term religion has reference to one's views of hisrelation to his Creator and to the obligations they impose of reverence for His Being and character and ofobedience to His will. It is often confounded with cultus of form or worship of a particular sect, but isdistinguishable from the latter."" We do not think that the above deﬁnition can be regarded as either precise oradequate. Articles 25 and 26 of our Constitution are based for the most part upon article 44(2) of the Constitutionof Eire and we have great doubt whether a deﬁnition of ""religion"" as given above could have been in the minds ofour Constitution-makers when they framed the Constitution. Religion is certainly a matter of faith with individualsor communities and it is not necessarily theistic. There are well known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainismwhich do not believe in God or in any Intelligent First Cause. A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a system ofbeliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as conducive to their spiritual well being,but it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else, but a (1) Vide Davie v. Benson [ 1890] USSC 39; 133U.S 333 at 342.1024 doctrine or belief. A religion may not only lay down a code of ethical rules for its followers to accept, it mightprescribe rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are regarded as integral parts ofreligion, and these forms and observances might extend even to matters of food and dress.The guarantee under our Constitution not only protects the freedom of religious opinion but it protects also actsdone in pursuance of a religion and this is made clear by the use of the expression "" practice of religion "" in article25. Latham C. J. of the High Court of Australia while dealing with the provision of section 116 of the AustralianConstitution which inter alia forbids the Commonwealth to prohibit the ""free exercise of any religion"" made thefollowing weighty observations(1)"

MESSRS OGALE GLASS WORKS LTD., OGALE WDI […The assessee manufactures lanterns and other glassware at its works in Aundh State. In the relevant accountingyears the assessee secured some contracts for the supply of lanterns and other glassware to the Government ofIndia.The price of the goods supplied under the contracts were paid by cheques drawn on the Reserve Bank of India,Bombay.The cheques used to be received by the assessee in Aundh and cashed through its bank at Bombay as hereinafterstated.The assessee being a non-resident company its liability to British Indian income-tax depended upon its receipt ofincome within British India. In the course of proceedings for the assessment of the assessee to income-tax for theﬁve years mentioned above, the assessee contended that its proﬁts on the sales accrued and were received in theAundh State where it received payment by the receipt of the cheques. The Income-tax Oﬃcer and, on appeal, theAppellate Assistant Commissioner held that the assessee received income, proﬁts or gains in British Indiainasmuch as the cheques were drawn on a bank in Bombay and had been cashed in Bombay and accordingly taxedthe assessee under section 4(1)(a) of the Indian Income-tax Act. On appeal by the assessee the Income-taxAppellate Tribunal upheld the assessment.Being aggrieved by the order of 'the Tribunal the assessee applied for a reference of the case to the High Court forthe determination of the question of law which arose out of the Tribunal's order and the Tribunal agreeing that aquestion of law did arise out of its order referred the following question to the High Court along with a statementof the case:"" whether on the facts of the case, income, proﬁts and gains in respect of sales made to the Government 188 ofIndia was received in British India within the meaning of section 4(1)(a) of the Act."" At the hearing of the referenceby the High Court learned advocate for the assessee contended, inter alia, that the cheques were received by theassessee in full satisfaction of the debt due to it by the Government of India and that the debt of the Governmentof India had been discharged by the acceptance of the cheques by the assessee in Aundh. The High Court felt thatin order to determine this contention it would be necessary for the Tribunal to ﬁnd certain further facts andaccordingly the High Court remanded the reference back to the Tribunal with a request to submit a supplementarystatement of the case on the lines indicated in the order dated the 15th September, 1949. The Tribunal submitteda supplementary statement of the case on the 8th June, 1951.In the supplementary statement of the case reference is made to clause 15 of the conditions of the contractgoverning supplies made by the assessee to the Government of India.The system of payment under that clause was that 90% of the price of each consignment would be paid on proofof dispatch of the stores from a Railway Station or port in India after inspection and the balance of 10% would bepaid on receipt of the consignment in good condition. That clause also provided ""Unless otherwise agreedbetween the parties, payment for the delivery of the stores will be made on submission of bills in the prescribedform in accordance with instructions given in the Acceptance of Tender by cheque on a Government Treasury inIndia or on a branch of the Reserve Bank of India or the Imperial Bank of India transacting Government business.""The assessee used to submit bills in prescribed form and on the form used to write:Kindly remit the amount by a cheque in our favour on any bank in Bombay."" After the submission of the bills theassessee used to receive from the Government cheques drawn on the Bombay branch of the Reserve Bank of Indiaalong with a memo stating.- 189 The undersigned has the honour to forward here. with cheque No. dated the billsnoted below "":- Then followed a tabular statement setting out the number, date and amount of, the cheques.

Our attention has been drawn to the followingpassage in paragraph 8 of the supplementary statement of the case:""By merely issuing a cheque to the assessee no payment as such was made by the Government. The payment wasonly made when the Government's account in the books of the bank was debited."" 190 Paragraph 9 of thesupplementary statement of the case thus summarises the Tribunal's ﬁndings:9. On the above facts our ﬁndings are:(1) Under the agreement with the Government of India the assessee had undertaken to receive the payment bycheque drawn on a bank in India.(2) The assessee company made a speciﬁc request to the Government to make payment of the sale proceeds bycheque drawn on a bank in Bombay.(3) When the assessee received the cheque, it did not receive the sale proceeds; it received the sale proceedssubject to the encashment of the cheque.(4) The assessee's bankers allowed the assesses to draw money against the security of the cheque on the very daythe cheque was sent for collection to the bank.(5) The assessee's bankers realised the payment of the cheque from the Reserve Bank of India, Bombay,, as agentsof the assessee. For rendering this service the bank charged the usual commission charged for collecting anoutstation cheque.(6) The sale proceeds were received in Bombay.(7) The cheque was encashed on behalf of the assessee at Bombay.(8) The proﬁts on the sales made to the Government of India were received by the assesssee in cash in Bombay.""The supplementary statement of the case concludes with the remark that both parties agreed to the correctnessof the facts.The main argument advanced before us, as before the High Court, by the learned advocate for the asses? see isthat the assessee received payment for the goods supplied by it when it received the cheques at Aundh. In otherwords the assessee accepted the cheques in full satisfaction and in discharge of its claim against the Governmentunder the contracts. The conclusion pressed upon us is that as the cheques were received at Aundh the paymentwas received there and consequently the assessee which is a non-resident company did not receive any income,proﬁts or gains in British India 191 within -the meaning of section 4(1)(a) of the Indian Income- tax Act and thereferred question should be answered in the negative.The contention put forward by the Revenue is twofold. In the ﬁrst place it is urged that the question whether theassessee accepted the cheques unconditionally and in full satisfaction of its claims under the contracts isconcluded by the Tribunal's ﬁndings of facts. This contention is not wholly without force. The passage fromparagraph 8 of the supplementary statement of the case and sub-paragraphs 3, 6 and 8 of paragraph 9 do tend tosuggest that in the view of the Tribunal no 'payment was made by the Government by merely issuing the cheques,that when the assessee received the cheques it did not receive the sale proceeds, that it received the sale proceedssubject to the encashment of the cheques, that the bank collected the cheques in Bombay as the agent of theassessee and that the sale proceeds were, therefore, received in cash in Bombay. But in view of the language usedin the supplementary statement of the case there is ample scope for the view that the portion% referred to abovedo not amount to ﬁndings of fact by the Tribunal but, on the contrary, are only inferences drawn by it from factsfound by it. Indeed the High Court was of the opinion that the Tribunal had not in terms come to a ﬁnding of factthat the assessee accepted the cheques in complete discharge of its claim for the price of goods supplied by it butwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/47 .html411A/ 9/12/2020THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY SOUTH, BOMBAY V . MESSRS OGALE GLASS WORKS LTD., OGALE WDI […on a consideration of the facts actually found by the Tribunal the High Court came to the conclusion that thenecessary inference to be drawn from those facts was that there was an arrangement between the assessee andthe Government from which it could be said that the acceptance by the assessee of the cheques from theGovernment resulted in an uncon- ditional discharge of the debt. In the circumstances we have to examine thefacts found by the Tribunal which have a bearing on this point.The assessee contends that on the facts found by the Tribunal it must be held that it received the cheques in fulland unconditional discharge of its claims for the price of goods sold and delivered by it to, the 192 Governmentand not conditionally subject to realisation.That a, sum of money may be received in more ways than one cannot be doubted. It may be received by thetransfer of coins or currency notes or a negotiable instrument which represents and produces cash and is treatedas such by businessmen. (See per Lord Lindley in Gresham Life Assurance Society v. Bishop (2)). Reference in thisconnection may also be made to the decisions in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Kameshwar Singh (2),Raghunandan prasad v. Commissioner of Income-tax (3) and Commissioner of Income-tax v.Maheswari Saran Singh (4). Learned Solicitor-General does not dispute this proposition but he argues that, in theabsence of any agreement, express or implied, to the contrary, a payment by a negotiable instrument is alwaysunderstood to be conditional. He refers us to Benjamin on Sale, 8th Edition, page 787, in support of the propositionthat the, intention to take a bill in absolute payment for goods sold must be clearly shown, and not deduced fromambiguous expressions, such as that the bill was taken ""in payment"" for the goods Stedman v. Gooch (5), andMaillard v.Duke of Argyle (6) or ""in discharge"" Kemp v. Watt (7), or ""in settlement"" of the price Re Rower and Haslam (8). Inaddition to the above English cases referred to in Benjamin on Sale the learned Solicitor-General also relies on thecase of Palaniappa Chetty v. Arunachalam Chetty (9) where it was held by the Madras High Court that theexecution of a formal receipt for the amount covered by the bill of exchange or hundi was not suﬃcient to rebutthe general presumption that the delivery of a bill of exchange or a hundi for a debt operated only as a conditionaldischarge of the debt' He insists that on the facts of this case there is nothing from which an agreement may beimplied that the cheques were given and received unconditionally in full discharge of the original contractualliability of the Government for the price of the goods supplied by the (1) L.R.

Sri Kolah, on the other hand, relied on the following facts in answer to the contentions of the learnedSolicitor-General:(i) that there was an arrangement by the contract itself, for payment by cheque (clause 15), (ii) that in the billssubmitted by him the assessee expressly asked for payment by cheque, (iii) that the Government sent cheques inpayment of the bills, (iv) that on receipt of the cheques the assessee returned the acknowledgement form dulysigned and stamped as a formal receipt, (v) that the drawer of the cheques was the Government of India and thedrawee was the Reserve Bank of India for whose solvency there could be no apprehension at all in the mind of theassessee.Sri Kolah contends that the cumulative eﬀect of these facts is clearly enough to establish that the cheques ;werereceived unconditionally as payment. Learned Solicitor- General points out that the assessee's request to pay theamount of the bills by cheques carries the matter no further, for the undertaking to pay by cheque was alreadythere. The -point of the request was that the cheques should be issued on some bank in Bombay. The insistence ona stamped receipt in advance of payment was, says the Solicitor-General, in keeping with the usual practice ofGovernment departments. Therefore,we have in this case,according to the learned Solicitor-General, nothingmore than a term in the contract for payment by cheques and the status of the drawer and drawee of the cheques.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/47 .html511A/ 9/12/2020THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY SOUTH, BOMBAY V . MESSRS OGALE GLASS WORKS LTD., OGALE WDI […These two circumstances, so submits the Solicitor-General are not suﬃcient to establish the fact of the acceptanceof the cheques as unconditional discharge. He contends that, in the absence of an express agreement, it is onlywhen the creditor elects to take a bill or cheque having it in his power to obtain payment in cash, that is to say,takes a bill or cheque by choice or preference instead of cash that an agreement may be implied that he took it asan unconditional and absolute payment 25 194 of the debt: Robinson v. Henry Reid (1) and Anderson v.Hillies (2). Such cases must be rare, for the creditor is not ordinarily likely to give up the advantage of having adouble remedy namely one on the bill or cheque and the other, on dishonour of the bill or cheque, on the originalcause of action. He points out that in this case there is no ﬁnding of any special agreement in this behalf and,therefore, submits the learned Solicitor-General, the assessee must be taken to have received the chequesconditionally, i.e., subject to realisation. The learned Solicitor-General concludes that, in the circumstances, nopayment was received by the mere receipt of the cheques and that payment was received only when the chequeswere cashed in Bombay and that such receipts in Bombay became immediately assessable to British Indian taxunder section 4(1)(a). The High Court repelled this line of argument and held that the assessee received paymenton the dates the cheques were delivered to it. We ﬁnd ourselves substantially in agreement with this conclusion. Itis to be remembered that there are four modes in which a contract may be discharged, namely (1) by agreement,(2) by performance, (3) by being excused by law from performing it and (4) by breach. In this case clause 15 of thecontract provides how the payment of the price is to be made. In short the contract itself, by that clause,prescribes the manner and the time for performance by the Government of its part of the contract and as theGovernment made the payments in the prescribed manner, i.e., by cheques, it fulﬁlled its engagement and suchpayment would under section 50 of the Indian Contract Act, operate as a discharge of the contract.It should also be remembered that the assessee sent his formal stamped receipts only after the receipt of thecheques and not along with the bills submitted by it.Therefore, the receipts cannot be regarded as having been sent in advance. The status of the drawer and thedrawee of the cheques is also a material consideration. Finally there is no suggestion that any of the cheques wasdishonoured on presentation. We, therefore, agree with Sri Kolah that (1) [ 1829] EngR 472; (1829) 9 B. & C. 449. (2)(1852) 21 L.J.C.P. (N. S.) 150.195 the several facts relied on by him and alluded to above, taken cumulatively, must lead us to the conclusion thatthe cheques were received in complete discharge of the claim for the price of the goods.Learned Solicitor-General, however, contends, on the' authority of the decision in Kodarmal v. Sagormal (1), thatthe request by the creditor to send a cheque does not imply any variation of the rule that payment by a negotiableinstrument is conditional on its being honoured on presentation within due time. Even if we accept his contentionthat the facts referred to above are not suﬃcient to raise the implication that the cheques were accepted aspayment and even if the sending of the cheques in terms of clause 15 or at the special request of the assessee didnot operate as an unconditional discharge of the Government's liability even then the assessee's position will be nobetter. When it is said that a payment by negotiable instrument is a conditional payment what is meant is thatsuch payment is subject to a condition subsequent that if the negotiable instrument is dishonoured on present-ation the creditor may consider it as waste paper and resort to his original demand: Stedman v. Gooch (2). It is saidin Benjamin on Sale, 8th Edition, page 788:- The payment takes eﬀect from the delivery of the bill, but is defeatedby the happening of the condition, i.e., non- payment at maturity."" In Byles on Bills, 20th Edition, page 23, theposition is summarised pithily as follows:' A cheque, unless dishonoured, is payment."" To the same eﬀect are thepassages to be found in Hart on Banking, 4th Edition, Volume I, page 342. In Felix Hadley & Co. v. Hadley (3), ByrneJ. expressed the same idea in the following passage in his judgment at page 682:"" In this case I think what took place amounted to a conditional payment of the debt; the condition (1) (1907) 9Bom. L.R. 903 at p. 911. (3) L. R. (I 898) 2 Ch. D. 680.(2) (1793) 1 ESP. 5.196 being that the cheque or bill should be duly met or honoured at the proper date. If that be the true view, then Ithink the position is exactly as if an agreement had been expressly made that the bill or cheque should operate aspayment unless defeated by dishonour or by not being met;and I think that that agreement is implied from giving and taking the cheques and bills in question."" The followingobservations of Lord Maugham in Bhokana Corporation v. Inland Revenue, Commissioners (1) are also apposite:www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/47 .html611A/ 9/12/2020THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY SOUTH, BOMBAY V . MESSRS OGALE GLASS WORKS LTD., OGALE WDI […"" Apart from the express terms of section 33, sub-section 1, a similar conclusion might be founded on the wellknown common law rules as to the eﬀect of the sending of a cheque in payment of a debt, and in the fact thatthough the payment is subject to the condition subsequent that the cheque must be met on presentation, the dateof payment, if the cheque is duly met, is the date when the cheque was posted."" In the case before us none of thecheques has been dishonoured on presentation and payment cannot, therefore, be said to have been defeated bythe happening of the condition subsequent, namely dishonour by non-payment and that being so there can be noquestion, therefore, that the assessee did not receive payment by the receipt of the cheques. The position,therefore, is that in one view of the matter there was, in the circumstances of this case, an implied agreementunder which the cheques were accepted unconditionally as payment and on another view, even if the chequeswere taken conditionally, the cheques not having been dishonoured but having been cashed, the payment related2back to the dates of the receipt of the cheques and in law the dates of payments were the dates of the delivery ofthe cheques On the footing, then, that the assessee received payment as soon as the cheques were delivered to itthe question still remains as to when and where the assessee received such payment. The (1) L. R. [ 1938] A.C 380at p. 399.197 answer is obvious, says the assessee, namely that it received Payment in Aundh where the cheques weredelivered to it. The learned Solicitor-General, however, contests that argument. According to. him the chequeswere delivered to the assessee as soon as they were posted. The rejoinder of the assessee is two-fold. In the ﬁrstplace it is said that this is an entirely new ,question of law which was never raised or argued before the Tribunal andwas not dealt with by it and, therefore, cannot be said to arise out of the Tribunal's Order and consequently theCourt has no jurisdiction, while exercising its advisory jurisdiction under section 66 of the Indian Income-tax Act, topermit such anew question of law to be raised at this stage.Learned Counsel for the assessee relies on the cases Of Commissioner Excess Proﬁts Tax, West Bengal v. JeewanlalLtd. Chainrup Sampatram v. C. I. T., West Bengal (2), Alla- habad Bank Ltd. v. C..I. T. West Bengal (3), MohanlalHiralal v. C. I. T., C. P. & Berar (4), and Hira Mills Ltd., Cawnpore v. Income-tax Oﬃcer, Cawnpore(5), while thelearned Solicitor-General refers us to the decisions in Madanlal Dharnidharka v. Commissioner of Income-tax,Bombay City(6), and Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi v. Punjab National Bank Ltd. (7). In the view we havetaken it is not necessary for us, on this occasion, to express any opinion on the larger question as to the scope,meaning and import of the words ""any question of law arising out of"" the Tribunal's order on the interpretation ofwhich there exists a wide divergence of judicial opinion. It should be noted that this is not a base where theTribunal having refused to refer a question of law an application was made to the High Court to, exercise itsjurisdiction under sub-section (2) of section 66. Here the Tribunal in exercise of its powers under sub-section (1) ofthat section did refer a question of law to the High Court. Nobody at any time contended (1) [ 1951] 20 I.T.R. 39 at P.47.(2) [ 1951] 20 I.T.R- 484 at PP. 493, 496.(3) [ 1952] 21 I.T.R. 169.(4) [ 1952] 22 I.T.R. 448.(5) [ 1946], 14 I.T.R. 417.(6) [ 1948] 16 I.T.R. 227 at P. 232.(7) [ 1952] 21 I.T.R. 526.198 and even now it is not suggested before us that the question of law referred to the High Court did not arise outof the Tribunal's order or had not been properly referred to the High Court. A question of law arising out of its orderhaving thus been properly referred by the Tribunal under sub-section (1) the High Court had to deal with andanswer it in exercise of its jurisdiction under sub-section (5).In support of its contention that the question should be answered in the aﬃrmative the Revenue advanced theargument, based on certain facts, that the cheques had been accepted only. conditionally and, therefore, therewas no payment until the cheques had been cashed and the cheques having been cashed in Bombay the paymentmust be regarded as having been received in Bombay. That argument did not ﬁnd favour with the High Court andthat being the position the Revenue sought to raise before the High Court, as it does before us, an alternativeargument, also based on facts, that the cheques having, at the request of the assessee, been posted at Delhi, themere posting of the cheques in such circumstances operated as payment in Delhi. Here no new question of law iswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/47 .html711A/ 9/12/2020THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY SOUTH, BOMBAY V . MESSRS OGALE GLASS WORKS LTD., OGALE WDI […sought to be raised. The question of law still is, whether on the facts of this case, income, proﬁts and gains inrespect of sales made to the Government of India was received in British India within the meaning of section 4(1)(a) of the Act. The argument is that as the cheques were posted at Delhi at the request of the assessee paymentwas received by it in British India. It is said that although the language in which the question has been framed iswide enough to include this branch of the argument, the question should, nevertheless, be read as circumscribedby the facts on which the Tribunal's decision was made and should not be regarded as at large. This suggestionmeans that the question must be read as limited only to those facts on which alone reliance was placed in supportof the argument actually advanced before the Tribunal and on which then Tribunal's decision was founded, leavingout all other facts appearing on the record and even referred to in the Tribunal's order and the statements of thecase. There is no warrant for such suggestion.199 The language of the question clearly indicates that the question of law has to be determined "" on the facts ofthis case."" To accede to the contention of the assessee, will Involve the undue cutting down of the scope of thequestion by altering its language. Seeing that the High Court permitted this argument to be advanced beforethem we are not prepared to shut it out.Sri Kolah then contends that the requisite facts, on which this branch of the argument may be based, are not to befound in the order of the Tribunal and the statements of the case and, therefore, this argument should not beentertained. There would have been considerable force in this contention if the facts necessary to support the newargument advanced by the Revenue were not on the record.But such is not the cases here as will be presently shown.The High Court conceded that if t he assessee had requested the Government to send the cheques by post then itwould have made the post-oﬃce its agent and in that event the posting of the cheques by the Government atDelhi would have been delivery of the cheques to the assessee in Delhi. The High Court, however, held that therewas no ﬁnding by the Tribunal that it point of fact the assessee had ever requested the Government to send thecheques by post and that that being the position it could not be said that the cheques had been delivered to theassessee in Delhi. In our opinion, for reasons to be presently stated, this part of the decision of the High Courtcannot be supported on facts and its conclusion cannot be sustained in law.Turning to the order of the Tribunal we ﬁnd the following passages:"" All payments for the goods supplied were made by cheques drawn by the Government department at Delhi onthe Reserve Bank of India, Bombay Branch. The cheques were received by the assessee Company in its oﬃce inAundh State."" The ﬁnding of fact recorded in the ﬁrst statement of the case also comprises the following (interalia):"" These cheques were received by the assessee Company at its oﬃce in Aundh State by post,"" 200 The ﬁnding offact in paragraph 3 of the Supplementary Statement of the case is thus recorded:"" 3. The assessee company used to submit the bills and on the form of the bill it used to write ""Kindly remit theamount by a cheque in our favour on any bank in Bombay.The question for our consideration is as to what, on the legal principles laid down in judicial decisions, theseﬁndings of fact amount to.In Norman v. Rickets(1), the creditor carrying on business as milliner in Bond Street wrote to one of the customerswho resided in Suﬀolk saying the favour of a cheque within a week will oblige."" The customer upon such requestsent a cheque for the amount by post. The cheque was stolen in the transit and was paid by the Bank to the thief. Itwill be noted that there was no express request to send the cheque by the post, but nevertheless it was held thatthe sending of the cheque by post was payment.On appeal the Court of Appeal upheld the trial Court and observed:"" An express request to send through the post was not necessary. If what the plaintiﬀs said amounted to a requestto send the cheque by the post, then there was payment. To answer that question the existing circumstances mustbe looked at. A milliner in London wrote to a lady in Suﬀolk asking for a cheque. Did that letter reasonably lead thelady to suppose, and did she suppose that she might send the cheque by post? She could not suppose that she wasto send a messenger with it or come up to London herself.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/47 .html811A/ 9/12/2020THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY SOUTH, BOMBAY V . MESSRS OGALE GLASS WORKS LTD., OGALE WDI […The only reasonable and proper meaning to be attached to it, whatever Madame phillipe might have intended wasthat she was to send the cheque by post. She, therefore, reasonably believed that she was invited to send hercheque by post, and she did what she was asked to do. Consequently what she did amounted to payment."" InThairlwal v. The Great Northern Railway Co.,(2) the directors by their report recommended (a) the declaration ofdividend at certain rates, and (b) the (1) (1886) 3 T.L.R. 182.(2) [ 1910] UKLawRpKQB 112; L.R. (1910) 2 K.B, 509.despatch of dividend warrants by post. At the half yearly general meeting the shareholders passed a resolutionthat dividends be declared at certain altered rates but said nothing about sending the same by post. Dividendwarrants were sent to a stock-holder by post but it was lost in the post. Bray J., held that in the circumstancesthere was a request by the stock-holder to the company to pay the amount due to him by means of a warrant sentby post. The case of Badische Anilin Und Soda Fabrik v. Basle Chemical Works(1), was concerned with a Swissseller who was asked to send the goods by post to England which he did. The goods were, manufactured accordingto an invention protected by an English Patent. The question was as to who brought the goods to England so as tobe liable to an action for infringement. It was held that the post-oﬃce was the agent of the English buyer and,therefore, the Swiss seller could not be sued. After stating that the seller had sent the goods in pursuance of theorder from the buyer to a particular named carrier namely the post-oﬃce which, is after all only a carrier of parcelslike any other carrier Lord Halsbury at p. 204 said:It is not necessary that the carrier should have been named.If, according to the ordinary course of delivery, the carrier would be the person who would receive it, that would bejust as good, for the purpose of the argument, as if the carrier had been actually named; but we have not toconsider that question here, because the carrier is named. Then, for what reason am I to depart from the well-known and recog- nised principle of law that, under these circumstances, when goods are delivered by the order ofthe buyer to a named' carrier, from that moment the goods vest in the buyer ?"" The decision in Comber v.Leyland(2), is very important for our purpose in that it explains the meaning and implication of the word "" remit ""which is the word used by the assessee when it requested the Government Department to "" remit "" the amount bycheque. There (1) [ 1897] UKLawRpAC 52; L.R. [ 1898] A.C. 200.26 (2) [ 1898] UKLawRpAC 29; L.R. [ 1898] A.C. 524.202 was in that case no express reference to the post-oﬃce at all. Said Lord Herschell, at p. 530:""I cannot doubt that the word ""remit "" there means this and nothing beyond this-that the bank post bills, whenobtained in favour of the plaintiﬀs, should be sent in the ordinary course and the ordinary manner in which suchdocuments are sent by commercial men, namely, by mail, and that as soon as that had been done all obligationand all liability of the defendant ceased. I think it is impossible on these words to maintain that there was anobligation and a liability incumbent upon him until those bank post bills had reached the hands of the plaintiﬀs inEngland.In Mitchell Henry v. Norwich Union Life Insurance Society Ltd.(1), the defendants sent a written notice. to theplaintiﬀ stating that the sum of pound 48-5-8d which would shortly become due should be paid at their oﬃce andasking the plaintiﬀ "" when remitting "" to return the notice.There was no express request to send the amount by post.Bailhache J. held that by the use of the word"" remitting"" the defendants had impliedly authorised the plaintiﬀ topay them by sending the money through the post in the ordinary way in which money was remitted by post, butthat it was not usual to send so large a sum in Treasury notes by post.Apart from the impropriety of sending a large amount in Treasury notes by post, this case does support the viewthat the request by the creditor "" to remit "" the amount due, without more, is tantamount to a request to send theamount by post. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal.On the other hand if there be no express or implied request by the creditor to send the amount by post the mereposting of a hundi duly endorsed in favour of the addressee does not operate as delivery of the hundi to theaddressee so as to pass the title in the hundi to the addressee, for the post- oﬃce in such circumstances does notwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/47 .html911A/ 9/12/2020THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY SOUTH, BOMBAY V . MESSRS OGALE GLASS WORKS LTD., OGALE WDI […become the agent of the addressee. The case of Thorappa v. Umedmalji (2) is an instance on this point. In the caseof ex parte Cote (3) also there was no request by the addressee to (1) L.R. [ 1918] 2 K.B. 67.(2) (1923) 25 Bom. L.R. 604.(3) L.R. (I873) [ 1873] UKLawRpCh 104; 9 Ch. App. 27.203 send the bills by post. The result of the various judicial decisions are summarised in Benjamin on Sale, 8thEdition, pp. 769-77 1, and in Chalmer's Bills of Exchange, 12th Edition, pp. 51-52.A good deal of stress is laid by Sri Kolah on what he says is the basic diﬀerence between the postal regulations inEngland and those in India and he insists that the English decisions laying down the eﬀect of sending cheques bypost should not be rigidly 'followed here. He points out that in England the sender of the cheques has no right toreclaim the same after it is posted, and that, accordingly, immediately upon the posting of the cheques the postoﬃce becomes irrevocably the agent of the addressee and that, therefore, the delivery of the cheque to the post-oﬃce is, in English law, delivery to the addressee. But that, Sri Kolah maintains, is not the position under the IndianPost Oﬃce Act, 1898. We have been taken through the diﬀerent sections of that Act and the rules madethereunder and Sri Kolah contends that under the Indian law the sender has the right to reclaim the letter until it isactually delivered to the addressee and, therefore, until that time the post- oﬃce remains the agent of the senderand consequently the posting of a cheque cannot in India be regarded as delivery of the cheque to the addressee.We may, however, point out that this right of the sender, on which so much stress and importance are laid by thelearned advocate, is by no means an absolute right, for it is left entirely to the authorities to decide whether aletter once posted should be returned to the sender. This very narrow and qualiﬁed right can hardly be regarded asbringing about a position so diﬀerent from that prevailing in England as to make the English decisions whollyinapplicable. It may also be mentioned that in spite of such contention the English decisions have been adopted bythe Courts in India, e.g., Thorappa v. Umedmalji (supra) and the Indian Cotton Company Ltd. v. Hari Poonjoo (1). Itis, however, not necessary to pursue this line of reasoning any further for the principles underlying the Englishdecisions are clearly consonant with the provisions of (1) I.L,R. 1937 Bom. 763.204 the Indian law. There can be no doubt that as between the sender and the addressee it is the request of the'addressee that the cheque be sent by post that makes the post-oﬃce the agent of the, addressee. After 'suchrequest the addressee cannot be heard to say that the post-oﬃce was not his agent and, therefore, the loss of thecheque in transit must fall on the sender on the specious plea that the sender having the very limited right toreclaim the cheque 'Under the Post-Oﬃce Act, 1898, the post-oﬃce was his agent, when in fact there was no suchreclamation. Of course if there be no such request, express or implied, then the delivery of the letter or the chequeto the. post-oﬃce is delivery to the agent of the sender himself. Apart from this principle of agency there isanother principle which makes the delivery of the cheque to the post-oﬃce at the request of the addressee adelivery to him and that is that by posting the cheque in pursuance of the request of the creditor the debtorperforms his obligation in the manner prescribed and sanctioned by the creditor and thereby discharges thecontract by such performance (see section 50 of the Indian Contract Act and illustration (d) thereto).Sri Kolah points out that when the Indian Contract Act, 1872, was passed, the Indian Post-Oﬃce Act, 1866, was inforce. He has taken us through the relevant provisions of that old Act and he points out that those provisions werequite diﬀerent from those of the present Act. According to him illustration (d) to section 50 of the Indian ContractAct must, after the passing of the Act of 1898, be taken to have become inappropriate, obsolete and incorrect. Wedo not think, that there is any basic diﬀerence between the two Acts in respect of the matter under discussion. It.does not appear to us that the Act of 1898 enlarges the right of the sender to reclaim the postal article to sub anextent as to nullify illustration (d) or otherwise to aﬀect the well known general principle that a contractualobligation is discharged by the performance of the engagement or promise in the manner prescribed or,sanctioned by the promisee.205 Applying the above principles to the facts found by the Tribunal the position appears to be this. Theengagement of the Government was to make payment by cheques. The cheques were drawn in Delhi and receivedby the assessee in Aundh by post. According to the course of business usage in general to which, as part of thesurrounding circumstances, attention has to be paid under the authorities cited above, the parties must haveintended that the cheques should be sent by post which is the usual and normal agency for trans- mission of sucharticles and according to the Tribunal's ﬁndings they -were in fact received by the assessee by post. Apart from theimplication of an agreement arising from such business usage the assessee expressly. requested the Governmentwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1954/47 .html1011A/ 9/12/2020THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY SOUTH, BOMBAY V .

This, on the authorities cited above, clearly amounted in eﬀect toan express request by the assessee to send the cheques by post. The Government did act according to suchrequest and posted the cheques in Delhi. It can scarcely be suggested with-any semblance of reasonableplausibility that cheques drawn in Delhi and actually received by post in Aundh would in the normal course ofbusiness be posted in some place outside British India.This posting in Delhi, in law, amounted to payment in Delhi.In this view of the matter the referred question should, with respect, have been answered by the High Court in theaﬃrmative. We, therefore, allow the appeal and answer the question accordingly. In view of the fact that theappellant has failed in the main argument but has succeeded on a new one we think no order should be made as tocosts except that each party should bear and pay his or its own costs before us as well as before the High Court.Appeal allowed."

I to 16, who are the contesting defendants, pleaded in defence thatthe plaintiﬀs along with the pro-forma defendants Nos. 17 to 19 were recorded in revenue 62 papers as owners of1/5th share in the land in dispute, while the contesting defendants were recorded as owners of the remaining 4/5thshare and as such they were entitled to claim partition. The defendants denied that any agreement or condition inthe Wajib-ul-arz restricting their right to partition was binding after the expiry of the term of the Settlement andcontended that it could not operate as a bar to their claim to partition. The Assistant Collector trying the suit as aCivil, Court under section 117 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act (Act XVII of 1887) decreed the claim. He held thatthe contesting defendants were entitled only to get produce of 140 Bighas and 19 Biswas of land in theirpossession without payment of land revenue and had no interest in the remaining land. This decree was reversedon appeal, the High Court holding that the defendants are entitled to 4/5th share as proprietors, that the originalagreement repeated in subsequent Settlements was binding on the parties so long as the Settlements were inforce, that it ceased to have any eﬀect after the expiry of the Settlements and that the renewal of its terms in theSettlement of 1938-39 was not binding as they were not agreed to by the contesting defendants. The learnedJudges held that the judgment (D. 4) dated June 15, 1893 of the Chief Court of Punjab inter-parties, which held thatthe prohibition of partition contained in the Wajib-ul-arz did not survive the expiry of the period of the Settlement,was binding upon them. They took the view that the contesting defendants being. proprietors, the right ofpartition was inherent in their right of ownership. As a result of these ﬁndings the suit was dismissed.We have heard Dr. Tek Chand, learned counsel for the appellants, in support of the appeal at length but we are ofopinion that there is no force in the appeal.The parties are Meos and the land in dispute is situate in village Manota in Tehsil Ferozepore Jhirka in GurgaonDistrict. According to the Gazetteer of Gurgaon District (1910) the Meos owned nearly the whole of theFerozepore Tehsil and various other villages in Gurgaon. They are divided into several sub-tribes, and these sub-tribes possess a strong feeling of unity and the 63 power of corporate action. It was stated that "" in the mutiny themembers of each sub-division generally acted together; and district oﬃcers are advised to keep themselvesinformed of the names and characters of the men, who from time to time possess considerable inﬂuence overtheir fellow-tribesmen."" (P. 60).The documentary evidence regarding the title to the property in dispute ranges over a period of four Settlements,each Settlement being for a period of thirty years. The ﬁrst Settlement was made in 1839-42, the second in 1872-1879, the third in 1903-08 and the last in 1938-39 which is the current Settlement. The village was assessed toannual revenue of Rs. 323 for the, period of 30 years from 1246 to 1275 Fasli (corresponding to 1839-1862 A.D.)which was made payable by Dalmir Lamberdar who is described as sole owner.The Settlement papers were, however, lost during the mutiny and after taking fresh measurements the settle-:ment papers were completed. Alif Khan, Dalmir and Dilmor signed what is called an agreement binding them byall conditions, provisions and declarations made at the time of the Settlement (P. 12).It is common ground that the property was originally, granted in 1822 A. D. to Dalmir by Nawab Ahmad BakhshKhan Rais of Ferozepore Jhirka. The grant is not in writing and there is no contemporaneous record which couldthrow any light on its terms. Dalmir claimed to be the sole grantee with full proprietary rights. A number ofdocuments are attached to the Settlement record of 1863. They are important as showing how the property wasdealt with by the Settlement authorities from time to time and the state of the revenue records. The earliestdocument on record appe- ars to be an agreement dated September 28, 186 1, which is incorporated in paragraph18 of the Wajib-ul-arz of village Manota. It says that the tenure of the village is zamindari. Dalmir is entitled toproﬁt and liable for loss in respect of the entire village. The other biswadars are owners of the produce of the landcultivated by them but they pay no revenue. This, it is stated, is the beneﬁt they enjoy (P. 35 = D . II). This documentis signed in token of veriﬁcation by Dalmir Lamberdar, 64 Dilmor, Alif Khan Biswadar and Phusa Biswadar, who ,iredescribed as proprietors. Phusa, we are told, is the alias of Chhinga. There is a report of Mr. John Lawrence (laterLord Lawrence), Settlement Oﬃcer referred to in the Gazetteer, which says that the arrange ment then in voguewas that a few owners shared the proﬁt and loss of the land revenue and the others were exempted fromresponsibility.Manota was one of the few villages which continued to follow the system (P. 179).Paragraph 2 of the Wajib-ul-arz which relates to the mode of partition, after stating the area of the village as 837Bighas and 9 Biswas, says ""When we, the co-sharers want to partition it, we ourselves will do so of our accord inaccordance with our shares shown in the Khewat papers or through the village Patwari in the,presence of.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/49. h/0209595795i95wwwiiase95tml25 9/12/2CHHOTE KHAN V.

One biswdar is not competent to make a new abadi"". D. 10).P. 4 is a statement showing apportionment of Jama, (i.e., Khewat money) in the village. After stating that theSettlement of the village was made in the name, of Dalmir, sole owner, and that he alone was entitled, to proﬁtand liable for loss, it goes on to say that Alif Khan son of Amir and Phusa son of Chhinga and Dilmor havingcultivated a speciﬁed area of land be. came owners of the produce of the land without payment of rent and alsobecame entitled to proﬁt and liable for loss.Paragraph 10 of the Wajibul-arz contains an agreement about trees. It shows that the trees standing in the houseor ﬁeld of the owner belong to him, and he is competent to plant and cut them. So far as the occupancy tenantsare concerned, the trees standing in their houses also belong to them as they cultivate -land but Dalmir alone hadthe right to cut or sell them. These are all the material documents pertaining to the Settlement record of 1863.We now come to the Settlement record of 1877, 65 P. 17 is an important document. Paragraph I which deals withthe history of the village is reproduced below:-' ""Fifty-two years ago in Sambat 1880, Dalmir, Caste Meo, GotSogan, along with Dilmor and Chhinga, his real brothers, took possession of the area of this village, with thepermission of Nawab Ahmed Bakhshi Khan Sahib. Rais of Ferozepore, who granted him a Biswadari estatewithout payment of any Nazrana in lieu of the services rendered by him and made this desolate, tract abad. Healong with his brothers jointly remained in possession thereof and enjoyed proﬁt and bore loss. After him AmirKhan became abad in the village and along with us, proprietors, remained in possession. Accordingly, we theproprietors got his name, entered as a Biswadar at the time of the Revised Settlement.After him Sharif Khan, son of Ghariba, who was also a collateral, came to this village in Sambat 1916 and remainedin possession along with us proprietors. Accordingly we got his name also recorded along with ours on the 14thSeptember, 1863. We have up to this day been joint owners.This village has never been partitioned. Shares are given in the Khewat papers.,"" This document shows thatalthough the name of Dalmir is mentioned as being the sole grantee by virtue of the services rendered by him tothe Nawab, his two brothers also were in joint possession with him. Not only this but Amir Khan and Sharif Khan,who are both collaterals, also had joint possession of the village. They are all described as proprietors and theirnames are recorded as joint owners.The authenticity of this documentisbeyondquestion. It out sat the root of the theory of Dalmir being the soleowner.It is true that Dalmir was mentioned as the sole owner in D.4 but the grant was treated by Dalmir himself as being the joint property of his two brothers and the twocouaterals whether or not it was originally intended for the beneﬁt of the family as understood in its widest sense.Paragraph 5 of the Wajib-ul-arz relating to the tenure of the village and the mode of payment of revenue 9 66 saysthat the village is bilijmal (joint) and that the sons of Dalmir shall continue to pay the Government revenue inrespect of their own shares as well as the shares of the sons of his two brothers and the shares of the collaterals.The reason given is that no money is taken from the said co- sharers on account of relationship. (P. 15). Thisstatement is consistent only with joint ownership.Paragraph 7 of the Wajib-ul-arz also describes the tenure as Zamindari bilijmal and Repeats the statement that theother co-sharers of Dalmir do not pay any rent or Jama in respect of the land cultivated by them on account oftheir relationship. No single sharer has the right to reclaim the Banjar area without the consent of all theproprietors (P.19). This Wajib-ul-arz is veriﬁed by the proprietors, tenants, Bhandadars (a village servant to whom cultivation isallotted rent free), Kamins (menials) and the inhabitants of the village. It is admittedly signed by the ancestors ofthe parties (P. 22).The Khewat and the Khatauni (P. 31) prepared during the Settlement both record the ﬁve branches of the family asbeing in possession of a 1/5th share each. A similar entry is to be found in the Khatauni (D. 18)..liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/49. h/0209595795i95wwwiiase95tml35 9/12/2CHHOTE KHAN V. MAL KHAN & ORS [14] INSC 49; AIR 14 SC 55; 15 SCR 60 (21 Ap rl 14)It appears that during the currency of this Settlement two suits for partition were ﬁled in the Revenue Court butthe partition was not allowed (P. 5).Coming to the Settlement of 1903-08 we ﬁnd a Statement in clause 3 of the Wajib-ul-arz (D. 13) that thedescendants of Dalmir alone could get the land partitioned in ﬁve equal shares but the descendants of the otherfour co-sharers, who were, cultivating land without payment of revenue, owing to non-rendition of account inrespect of proﬁt and loss of their respective shares, could not have the land partitioned. , Lastly we come to theJamabandi of 1937-38 (P. 1). This shows that all the ﬁve branches were entered as being in possession of equalshares.Mehrab, grandson of Dalmir and one of the plaintiﬀs, who gave evidence as P. W. 5 admitted that defendants 67Nos. I to 16 were shown as proprietors in the Jamabandi but he never raised any objection to it. He also admittedthat Mehar Singh, grandson of Sharif Khan, sold his half share to Chhote Khan and Bhola, his coplaintiﬀs and thatthey did not challenge the same.We may now refer to the civil litigation which started in 1891. It arose upon the rejection of the applications forpartition made by Alif Khan and Sharif Khan on September 24, 1890, by the Assistant Collector. Alif Khan ﬁled asuit against the descendants of the three brothers and the descendants of Sharif Khan. In the plaint (D. 1) heclaimed a declaration of 1/5th share of the entire village. The sons of Dalmir denied the claim. In their writtenstatement (B. 2) they alleged that in previous proceedings they had deniedthe plaintiﬀs' right to partition and thatthe defendants had been in adverse possession of the land and that the plaintiﬀs and others had been cultivatingland as Bhandadars (village servants). The Subordinate Judge decreed the claim (D. 3). This decree was upheld bythe Divisional Judge, but the judgment is not on record. In second appeal the Chief Court amended the decree bydeclaring that the plaintiﬀ was entitled to 1/5th share in the village to be enjoyed subject to the qualiﬁcations andrestrictions set forth in the Khewat and the Wajib-ul-arz which do not permit of his obtaining partition while thepresent Wajib-ul-arz was in force. This decree was made upon the admission made by the defendants in the courseof the arguments. Paragraph 8 of the Wajib-ul-arz of 1877 (D.12=p . 16) which was the subject of conﬂicting interpretation by the parties was interpreted by the Chief Court tomean that its eﬀect was to prohibit general division among the co-sharers while the Wajibul-arz was still in force.They held that the ﬁve sons of Dalmir could separate their shares inter se but not the other co- sharers. We are ofopinion that this judgment which is inter-partes ﬁnally set at rest the controversy between them by declaring thatthe parties were joint owners holding equal shares and constitutes res judicata. The judgment is also in conformitywith the true eﬀect of the documentary evidence on the 68 record. No doubt the name of Dalmir was entered. insome documents as the sole owner but that entry by itself is not conclusive and must be read in conjunction withthe other entries in the Settlement record. Dalmir may have been the original grantee but his own conduct showsthat he did not regard himself as absolute owner to the exclusion of his own brothers. Indeed according to theentry he even treated his collaterals on an equal footing. His description as sole owner in the circumstances carriesno value. Whatever may have been the position at the time of the original grant, the subsequent conduct of theparties unmistakably shows that all the ﬁve branches were treated as owners in equal shares. Dalmir as thelamberdar was made responsible for the payment of the entire landrevenue. He was -entitled to proﬁt and wasresponsible for loss. The others were given less land and were exempted from payment of rent or revenue onaccount of relationship. This arrangement appears to have been fairly general in those days as appears from thereport of Mr. (later Lord) Lawrence, Settlement Oﬃcer, re- ferred to above. The arrangement was that' a fewowners shared the proﬁt and loss of the land revenue assessment while the others were exempted. TheGovernment was primarily interested in the payment of the revenue and they apparently found it more convenientto hold the head or the most inﬂuential member of the family as responsible for payment of the entire revenueleaving it to him to make such arrangement among his co-sharers as he thought ﬁt. In later Settlements theowners accepting responsibility for the payment of the land revenue did not ﬁnd it proﬁtable and the systemgradually disappeared. Lord Lawrence remarks that at the third Settlement the number of villages which stillcontinued the system was reduced to three and one of these was Manota in Ferozepore Tehsil (page 179). Thisaccounts for Dalmir being called the sole owner and being made responsible for payment of Government revenue.By section 44 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act an entry made in the record of rights or in an annual record shall bepresumed to be, true until the contrary 69 is proved. That entries in the Jamabandies fall within the purview of therecord of rights under section 31 of the Act admits of no doubt. Section, 16 of the old Act (XXIII of 1871) laid downthat entries in the record of rights made or authenticated at a regular Settlement shall be presumed to be true. Weare satisﬁed that the materials on the record taken as a whole justify the view which has been taken by the HighCourt that the contesting defendants are joint owners and not mere cultivators who are not entitled to claim.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/49. h/0209595795i95wwwiiase95tml45 9/12/2CHHOTE KHAN V.

The judgment of the Chief Court also recognized the proprietary right of the defendantsbut qualiﬁed it by the declaration that so long as the Settlement was in force, they were not entitled to partition byreason of their agreement recorded in the Settlement papers. The Settlements of 1877 and 1908-09 have ceasedto operate and the entry in the current Settlement of 1938-39 having been made under the orders of the Collectorhas no value when the contesting defendants did not agree to its being incorporated. The previous agreement wasnot one for perpetuity but for a limited period only and there is no reason in law why the prohibition againstpartition should be now enforced against the contesting defend. ants. It has been held in a number of cases thatthe entry regarding agreement in a Wajib-ul-arz holds good during the period of the Settlement in which it is madeand becomes inoperative when the Settlement has come to an end: Hira and others v.Muhamadi and Other8 (1); Allah Bakhsh and Others. Mirza Bashir-uddin and Others (2) and Lieut. ChaudhriChattar Singh v. Mt. Shugni and Another (3).We agree with the High Court in holding that partition is a right incident to the ownership of property and once thedefendants are held. as co-owners, their right to partition cannot be resisted.It was contended by Dr. Tek Chand that the appellants had acquired title by adverse possession over thedefendants' share for more than 56 years. This plea was raised in the plaint but evidently it w as not pressed (1)16P.R. 1915 (P. 89).(2)1932 LIT.Rn. 56.(3) A.I.R. 194 Lah. 239.70 for no issue was framed, nor any ﬁnding recorded by the trial Court. This point is not taken even in the groundsof appeal to this Court. The plea has no substance and was rightly rejected by the High Court on the ground thatpossession was under an arrangement between the co-sharers.and no question of adverse possession could arise under the circumstances.We hold that there is no force in this appeal and dismiss it with costs.Appeal dismissed."

ST A TE OF WEST BENGAL [14] INSC 51; AIR 14 SC 45; 15 S CR 28 (22 Aprl 14)so far as they are material, may be brieﬂy stated. The appellant, S. K. Dutt, carried on business as a buildingcontractor under the name and style of British India Construction Company. This ﬁrm had a branch at Asansolwhich was, at the material dates, in charge of the appellant J. K. Bose. In May, 1942, the military took upconstruction of dumps and roads in this area, and the appellant, R. W. Mathams, who was the Garrison Engineer atAsansol, was put in charge of it, and the appellant, P. C. Ghose, was functioning as overseer under him. On orabout 10th May, 1942, an order was placed with S. K. Dutt for the construction of dumps at a place called Burnpurnear Asansol. The works were executed in June and July 1942, and sums amounting to Rs. 1,74,000 were paid to S.K. Dutt on account there for. The case for the prosecution is that this amount was in excess of what was due to himfor works actually done, by about Rs. 56,000, and that with a view to avoid the refund of this excess, the appellantsentered into a conspiracy, under which S. K. Dutt was to prefer a claim for construction of roads purported to havebeen carried out in execution of an order which R. W.Mathams was to issue; P. C. Ghose was to measure the road so claimed to have been constructed, and the bill wasto be passed for an amount exceeding what had actually been paid.In accordance with this scheme, S. K. Dutt wrote Exhibit 19 on 28th January, 1943, claiming payment for ""additional work within the store dump area ""; R. W. Mathams passed an order bearing date 7th July, 1942, Exhibit10, placing an order with S. K. Dutt for the construction of roads; P. C.Ghose prepared the ﬁnal bill,, Exhibit 6, for Rs. 1,89,458- 14-0 on 15th March, 1943, and the same was passed by R.W.Mathams. It is stated for the prosecution that the roads alleged to have been constructed by the appellant, S. K.Dutt, were, in fact, 28 218 constructed by the military, and that the order of R. W.Mathams bearing date 7th July, 1942, was, in fact, brought into existence sometime in March, 1943. It is furtherstated for the prosecution that as consideration for passing the above bill, a bribe of Rs. 30,000 was agreed to bepaid to R. W. Mathams and to P. C. Ghose, that S. K. Dutt sent that amount by cheque to J. K. Bose on 16th March,1943, and that on 17th March, 1943, R. W. Mathams was paid Rs. 18,000 and P. C. Ghose Rs. 12,000 as illegalgratiﬁcation. The appellants were accordingly charged with conspiracy to cheat the Government and bribery.The appellants denied the conspiracy. They stated that the roads had, in fact, been constructed by S. K. Dutt. Withreference to the cheque for Rs. 30,000, the case of S. K.Dutt and P. C. Ghose was that the amount was required for payment to sub-contractors, who had constructed theroads under S. K. Dutt, and that it was, in fact, utilised for that purpose. They produced Exhibit 27 series, which arereceipts purporting to have been signed by the several sub contractors.The Special Tribunal which tried the case, delivered its judgment on 9th May, 1946, acquitting the appellants onthe charge of conspiracy but convicting them for the oﬀence of bribery. Appeals against this judgment were takento the High Court of Calcutta by the appellants against their conviction on the charge of bribery and by theGovernment against the acquittal on the charge of conspiracy. By their judgment dated 14th July, 1947, thelearned Judges (Clough and Ellis JJ.) dismissed the appeals of the appellants, and allowed that of the Government.'In the result, the appellants stood convicted on the charges both of conspiracy and bribery.R. W. Mathams applied to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal, and by an order dated 13th November,1947, the appeal was admitted only on the question whether the prosecution was bad for want of sanction undersection 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The appellants, S. K. Dutt, J. K. Bose and P. C. Ghose, appealed to theFederal Court under a certiﬁcate Under section 205 of the Government of 219 India Act, and as the order passed intheir appeal forms the foundation of the argument in the present appeals, it becomes necessary to refer to it insome detail.One of the grounds argued by the appellants in the Federal Court was that the requirements of section 257 of theCriminal Procedure Code had not been complied with, and that there was accordingly no fair trial. The facts onwhich this objection was based are these: The complaint was instituted on 7th June, 1945. The examination ofwitnesses on the side of the prosecution commenced on 6th September, 1945, and it was concluded afterundergoing several adjournments on 29th March, 1946. On 27th March, 1946, the appellant, J. K. Bose, ﬁled a listof 15 witnesses to be examined for the defence. Most of them were persons who are alleged to have given thereceipts, Exhibit 27 series, acknowledging payment of money for construction of works done by them.

ST A TE OF WEST BENGAL [14] INSC 51; AIR 14 SC 45; 15 S CR 28 (22 Aprl 14)order was passed on 29th March, 1946, in the absence of the appellants and their lawyers, that summons mightissue for 8th April, 1946, reserving the decision on the question whether the witnesses were necessary for thatdate. Summons was not sent in the manner prescribed by sections 68 and 69 of the Code but by ordinary post.When the case was taken up on 8th April, 1946, it was found that two of the envelopes had returned from theDead Letter Oﬃce, and as to the rest, there was nothing to show what had happened to them. In this situation,the Tribunal passed an order that no further process would issue, and the case was then decided on the evidenceon record, and the appellants convicted on the charge of bribery.On these facts, it was contended before the Federal Court that the procedure adopted by the Tribunal was incontravention of section 257 of the Code, and amounted to a serious irregularity. In upholding this objection, theCourt observed that section 257 was imperative in its terms, that process could, not be refused except for thereasons mentioned therein, that no such reasons existed, and that the order of the Tribunal, dated 8th April, 1946,refusing to issue process was accordingly illegal. It was further observed that 220 the witnesses cited would bematerial because their evidence, if accepted, would establish that Exhibit 27 series were genuine, and that thiswould militate against the case of the prosecution in respect of both the charges of conspiracy and bribery. TheCourt accordingly set aside the convictions, and directed that the appeal should be re- heard ""after giving areasonable opportunity to the appellant No. 2 (J. K. Bose) to take such steps as he may be entitled to take in lawfor enforcing the attendance of the witnesses mentioned in the list of the 27th March, and after considering theevidence of such of these witnesses as may appear before the Court."" This judgment was passed on 23rd April,1948. When the matter went back to the High Court of Calcutta in pursuance of this judgment, an order waspassed by that Court on 2nd August, 1948, adjourning the hearing of the appeals till the disposal of the appeal ofR. W. Mathams by the Privy Council. Then came the Independence of India, and the appeal of R. W. Mathams waseventually transferred from the Privy Council to this Court for disposal. As information concerning the exactposition of the appeal of R. W. Mathams was for sometime lacking, and as the prospect of that appeal being heardappeared distant, the High Court passed an order on 9th April, 1951, that the remanded appeals would be taken upfor hearing on 11th June, 1951, that the appellants should take the necessary steps for examination of thewitnesses mentioned in the list, dated 27th March, 1946, and that the oﬃce should take steps to secure theattendance of those witnesses, except one who was in East Pakistan.The list was accordingly ﬁled on 8th May, 1951. Therein, it was stated that out of the 15 persons whose nameswere mentioned in the list, dated 27th March, 1946, it was possible to get the address of only six persons, and thatas for the rest, it was not possible to trace their whereabouts, as they had mostly migrated to Asansol at the timewhen the works were being executed and had since left that place. Out of the six persons whose addresses weregiven, B. C. Mukherjee and R. K. Paul, were served and examined in Court.221 A third witness was given up, as he was a handwriting expert. The fourth witness Liakat Hossain, had migratedto East Pakistan, and no process could be issued against him.Another witness, Sanichar Mistry, had died in the hospital.As regards the sixth witness, Sashinath De, the endorsement on the summons was that he had left the place, andthat it was not known to which place he had gone. The learned Judges who heard the appeal on remand held bytheir judgment, dated 6th September, 1951, that on the evidence both the charges of conspiracy and bribery hadbeen estab- lished, and convicted the appellants, S. K. Dutt, J. K. Bose and P. C. Ghose, under the appropriatesections. The matter comes before us on special leave under a certiﬁcate of the High Court under article 134(c) ofthe Constitution.The argument in support of these appeals is that the trial of the appellants had been vitiated by reason of the factthat they had no reasonable opportunity to examine their witnesses, and that their convictions were accordinglybad.We think that this complaint is well-founded. By its judgment, dated 23rd April, 1948, the Federal Court decidedthat the order of the Tribunal, dated 8th April, 1946, declining to issue process for the witnesses mentioned in thelist, dated 27th March, 1946, was in contravention of section 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code, that the evidenceof those witnesses would be material for refutation of the charges of both conspiracy and bribery, and thataccordingly the appellants should be granted an oppor- tunity to examine those witnesses. On this order, the onlyquestion that has to be decided is whether the appellants got such an opportunity when the appeal was re-heardin pursuance of the order of remand. The important point to be noted is that by reason of the order of the HighCourt, dated 2nd August, 1948, the appeal was not taken up for hearing immediately as it ought to have been, andiofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/5/95955953i95www.liiaase951.html35 9/12/ 2020RONALD WOOD MATHAMS V . ST A TE OF WEST BENGAL [14] INSC 51; AIR 14 SC 45; 15 S CR 28 (22 Aprl 14)that it was only on 8th May, 1951, that it was possible for the appellants to take steps in the matter. But by thattime, the situation had undergone a radical change. In their application, the appellants stated that thewhereabouts of most of 222 the witnesses could not be traced, and this is not to be wondered at Burnpur, wherethe works had to be executed, is a petty township situated in a corner of the State, and it sprang into prominenceonly owing to military activities.Contractors and sub-contractors ﬂocked to that place from all sides for executing the military works, and there isnothing improbable in their having left the place when the situation changed, as it did on the conclusion of the warby the end of 1945. And there arose a further complication.In 1947, two Dominions came into being as a result of the Indian Independence Act, and there was a partition ofBengal. It is not unlikely that some of these contractors belonged to East Pakistan or bad settled there.That the list of witnesses given on 27th March, 1946, was not all ﬁctitious is borne out by the fact that two of themactually gave evidence at the re-hearing and a third had died in the hospital. When some of the witnessesmentioned in the list are proved to be real persons, there are no materials on which it can be aﬃrmed that theothers are ﬁctitious persons. Indeed, the evidence of the two witnesses,. Mukherjee and Paul, is that they bad seensome of those sub-contractors whose names appear in Exhibit 27 series, actually at work there. The learned Judgeshave rejected their evidence on the ground that they are not men of status; but on the question whether theappellants had made payments to the sub-contractors under Exhibit 27 series, the best evidence can only be ofthose persons. It may be that the two witnesses are not speaking the truth when they say that they saw the otherpersons mentioned in the list working on the roads, and it is possible that those persons are ﬁctitious. But it isequally possible that they are real persons, whose whereabouts could not be traced in the exceptionalcircumstances which had intervened. As admittedly three of them are real, it would be unsafe to act on the viewthat the others must be ﬁctitious, and if they are real persons who could not be examined for no fault of theappellants, grave injustice would result in the accused being condemned without the evidence of these witnesseshaving been taken. For this situation; the 223 appellants are not to blame. That was the result of the erroneousorder passed by the Tribunal on 8th April, 1946, refusing to issue process and the order of the High Court, dated2nd August, 1948, adjourning the appeal, till the disposal of the appeal of R. W. Mathams.In coming to the conclusion that the guilt of the appellants had been established, the learned Judges were greatlyinﬂuenced by the correspondence relating to the passing of the bill, in Particular the letter of S. K. Dutt, dated 23rdJanuary, 1943, Exhibit 18, by the long interval between the completion of the work which was in July, 1942, and thealleged payments under Exhibit 27 series which were after 17th March, 1943, and by various other circumstances,which probabilised the case for the prosecution. It must be conceded that the evidence on record tends toestablish a strong case against the appellants. But then, that is a case which they are entitled to rebut, and if, aswas held by the Federal Court, Exhibit 27 series would furnish good material for rebutting that case, the Court, bydeclining to issue process for the examination of the witnesses connected with those documents, has deprived theappellants of an opportunity of rebutting it. Whatever one may think of the merits of the appellants' contention,they cannot be convicted without an opportunity being given to them to present their evidence, and that havingbeen denied to them, there has been no fair trial, and the conviction of the appellants, S. K. Dutt, J. K. Bose and P.C. Ghose, cannot stand. The result may be unfortunate. Bat it is essential that rules of procedure designed toensure justice, should be scrupulously followed, and Courts should be jealous' in seeing that there is no breach ofthem. The, appeals will be allowed, and the appellants acquitted.Then there 'remains the appeal of R. W. Mathams. It has been already stated that by an order dated 13thNovember, 1947, the Privy Council gave him special leave to appear, limited to the question whether theproceedings were bad for want of sanction under section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code. By a further 224order dated 5th August, 1948, the Privy Council enlarged the scope of the appeal by permitting the appellant toraise the contention that there had been a contravention of section 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code. These arethe two points that arise for determination in his appeal. The question whether sanction under section 197 wasnecessary for instituting proceedings against the appellant on charges of conspiracy and of bribery, is nowconcluded by the decisions of the Judicial Committee in H. H. B. Gill 'V.The King (1) and Phanindra Chandra Neogy v. The King (1), and must be answered in the negative. The questionwhether there was contravention of section 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code and a denial or fair trial must, forthe reasons already given, be answered in the aﬃrmative, and the conviction of the appellant set aside on thatground.iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/14/5/95955953i95www.liiaase951.html45 9/12/ 2020RONALD WOOD MATHAMS V .

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKERJEA, J.-The plaintiﬀ, who is the appellantbefore us, commenced the suit, out of which this appeal arises, in the Court of the Civil Judge at Banaras (beingOriginal Suit No.79 of 1941) for enforcement of his right of pre-emption in respect of an enclosed plot of land with certainstructures upon it, situated within Moballa Baradeo in the city of Banaras and bearing Municipal No. D 37/48. Thepremises in suit admitted by belonged to defendants Nos. 2 to 5, who are residents of Calcutta and they sold. it bya conveyance executed on the 29th March, 1941, and registered on the 3rd of April following, to defendant No. 1,also a resident of Calcutta, for the price of Rs. 7,000. The plaintiﬀ is the owner of the two premises to wit, premisesNos. D 37/85 and D 37 /44, within the same Mohalla of the city of Banaras, which are in close proximity to theproperty in dispute and adjoin it on the northern and eastern sides respectively.It is averred by the plaintiﬀ that there is from very early, time a custom prevalent in the city of Banaras accordingto which the plaintiﬀ was entitled to claim pre- emption of the property in dispute on the ground of vicinage. It issaid that as soon as the plaintiﬀ received news of the sale, he made an immediate assertion or demand of hisrights and repeated the same in the presence of the witnesses as required by Muhammadan Law and he furthersent a registered notice to defendant No. I on the 21st May, 1941, askine the latter to transfer the property to theplaintiﬀ on receipt of the price which he had actually paid to the vendors. As the defendant No. 1 did not complywith this demand the present suit was brought, 72 The defendant No. 1 alone contested the suit and the pleastaken by him in his written statement can be classiﬁed under four heads. In the ﬁrst place, he denied that therewas any custom of pre-emption amongst nonMuslims in the city of Banaras as alleged by the plaintiﬀ. The secondplea taken was that even if there was any custom of pre-emption it could not be availed of in a case like this whereneither the vendors nor the vendee were natives of or domiciled in Banaras but were residents of a diﬀerentprovince. The third contention raised was that the plaintiﬀ had not made the two demands in the proper manneras required by Muhammadan Law and by reason of non-compliance with the essential pre-requisites to a claim forpreemption, the suit -was bound to fail. Lastly, it was contended that as the plaintiﬀ himself was the landlord ofthe property in suit and the, vendors were his tenants, he could not, under any law or custom, eject his owntenants by exercise of the right of pre-emption.The Civil Judge who tried the suit held, on the evidence adduced in the case, that there was in fact a custom of pre-emption in the city of Banaras, the incidents of which were the same as in Muhammadan Law. He held howeverthat the custom being a local custom it could not be enforced against either the vendors or the vendee in thepresent case, as none of them were natives of or domiciled in Banaras. The trial judge also found that the 'plaintiﬀdid not make the requisite demands which are -mandatory under Muhammadan Law.The result was that the plaintiﬀ 's suit was dismissed and in view of the ﬁndings arrived at by him, the Civil Judgedid not consider it necessary to decide the question as to whether the plaintiﬀ being himself a landlord couldassert any claim for pre-emption against his tenants on the basis of a custom.Against this decision the plaintiﬀ took an appeal to the High Court of Allahabad which was heard by a DivisionBench consisting of Mulla and Yorke JJ. The learned Judges agreed with the trial Court in holding that althoughthere was a custom of pre-emption in the city of Banaras, -yet the necessary condition for enforcing the custom inthat locality was that the vendor 73 and the vendee must be natives of or domiciled in the city.As this condition was not fulﬁlled in this case the plaintiﬀ 's claim could not succeed. In the result the High Courtaﬃrmed the decision of the trial judge and dismissed the appeal. The other questions as to whether the plaintiﬀhad made thedem'ands in strict compliance with the rules of Muhammadan Law and whether he could claim pre-emption against his own tenants on the basis of a right by custom were left undecided. The judgment of the HighCourt is dated the 29th August, 1944. After this, the plaintiﬀ applied for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee.This application was refused by the High Court but he got special leave under an order of the Judicial Committee,dated the 11th December, 1945. After the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee the appeal stoodtransferred to this Court for disposal.The contentions that have been raised before us by the parties to this appeal practically centre round one point.It is not disputed by either side that there is a custom of pre-emption in the entire city of Banaras; but whereas therespondents contend that the custom obtains exclusively amongst persons who are inhabitants of the city 'or-aredomiciled therein, the case of the appellant is that the custom admits of no such restriction or limitation and all.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/52. h/0209595195i95wwwiiase95tml28 9/12/2SHRI AUDH BEHARI SINGH V.

Before we examine the arguments that have been placedbefore us by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, it may be necessary to make a few general observationsregarding the law or laws which govern the exercise of the right of pre-emption in India at the present day.10 74 The Privy Council has said in more cases than one(1), that the law of pre-emption was introduced in thiscountry by the Muhammadans. There is no indication of any such conception in the Hindu Law and the subject hasnot been noticed or discussed either in the writings of the Smriti writers or in those of later commentators. SirWilliam Macnaghten in his Principles and Precedents of Mahomedan Law (2 ) has referred to a passage in theMakanirvana Tantra which, according to the learned author, implies that pre-emption was recognised as a legalprovision according to the notions of the Hindus.But the treatise itself is one on mythology, not on law and is admittedly a recent production. No value can beattached to a stray passage of this character the authenticity of which is not beyond doubt.During the period of the Mughal emperors the law of pre- emption was administered as a rule of common law ofthe land in those parts of the country which came under the domination of the Muhammadan rulers, and it wasapplied alike to Muhammadans and Zimmees (within which Christians and Hindus were included), no distinctionbeing made in this respect between persons of diﬀerent races and creeds(3).In course of time the Hindus came to adopt pre-emption as a custom for reasons of convenience and the custom islargely to be found in provinces like Bihar and Gujerat which had once been integral parts of the Muhammadanempire.Opinions diﬀer as to whether the custom of preemption amongst village communities in Punjab and other parts ofIndia was borrowed from the Muhammadans or arose independently of the Muhammadan Law, having its origin inthe doctrine of ""limited right"" which has always been the characteristic feature of village communities(4). Possiblymuch could be said in support of either view, and there is reason to think that even where the Muhammadan Lawwas borrowed (1)Vide Jadulat v, Janki Koer, 39 I.A. 101, 106; Digambar Singh v. Ahmad, 42 I.A. 10, 18.(2) Vide, page 14.(3) Vide Hamilton's Hedaya, Vol. III, P. 592.(4) Vide P.R. 98 of 1894.75 it was not always borrowed in its entirety. It would be useful to refer in this connection to the followingobservations of the Judicial Committee in Digambar v.Ahmad(1):"" In some cases the sharers in a village adopted or followed the rules of the Mahomedan Law of pre-emption, andin such cases the custom of the village follows the rules of the Mahomedan Law of pre-emption. In other cases,where a custom of pre-emption exists, each village community has a custom of pre-emption which varies from theMahomedan Law of pre-emption and is peculiar to the village in its provisions and its incidents. A custom of pre-emption was doubtless in all cases the result of agreement amongst the shareholders of the particular village, andmay have been adopted in modern times and in villages which were ﬁrst constituted in modern times."" It is notnecessary for our present purpose to pursue this discussion any further.Since the establishment of British rule in India the Muhammadan Law ceased to be the general law of the land andas pre-emption is not one of the matters respecting which Muhammadan Law is expressly declared to be the ruleof decision where the parties to a suit are Muhammadans, the Courts in British India administered theMuhammadan Law of pre-emption as between Muhammadans entirely on grounds of justice, equity and goodconscience' Here again there was no uniformity of views expressed by the diﬀerent High Courts in India and theHigh Court of Madras deﬁnitely held that the law of pre-emption, by reason of its placing restrictions upon the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/52. h/0209595195i95wwwiiase95tml38 9/12/2SHRI AUDH BEHARI SINGH V. GAJA DHAR JAIPURIA & ORS [ 14] INSC 52; AIR 14 SC 47; 15 SCR 70 (23 Aprl 14)liberty of transfer of property, could not be regarded to be in consonance with the principles of justice, equity andgood conscience(2). Hence the right of pre-emption is not recognised in the Madras Presidency at all evenamongst Muhammadans except on the footing of a custom. Rights of preemption have in some provinces likePunjab, Agra and Oudh been embodied in statutes passed by the Indian Legislature and where the law has beenthus codiﬁed (1) 42 I.A. 10, 18.(2) Vide Krishna Menon v. Keshavan, 20 Mad. 305.76 it undoubtedly becomes the territorial law of the place and is applicable to persons other than Muhammadansby reason of their property being situated therein. In other parts of India its operation depends upon custom andwhen the law is customary the right is enforceable irrespective of the religious persuasion of the partiesconcerned. Where the law is neither territorial nor customary, it is applicable only between Muhammadans as partof their personal law provided the judiciary of the place where the property is;situated does not consider such law to be opposed to the principles of justice, equity and good conscience. Apartfrom these a right of pre-emption can be created by contract and as has been observed by the Judicial Committeein the case referred to above, such contracts are usually found amongst sharers in a village. It is against thisbackground that we propose to examine the contentions that have been raised in the present case.The ﬁrst question that has been mooted before us is, whether the burden and beneﬁt of a right of pre-emption areincidents annexed to the lands belonging respectively to the vendor and the Pre-emptor or is the right merely oneof re- purchase, which a neighbour or co-sharer enjoys under Muhammadan Law, and which he can enforcepersonally against the vendee in whom the title to the property has already vested by sale. The learned counsel forthe appellant has pressed for acceptance of the ﬁrst view while the Solicitor-General appearing for therespondents has contended, that by no accepted principles of jurisprudence can the preemptor be said to have aninterest in the property of the vendor. It is pointed out that the right of preemption arises for the ﬁrst time whenthere is a com- pleted sale and the title of the purchaser is perfected and if the right was one attached to theproperty, it must have existed prior to the sale and should have been available not merely in case of sale but in allother kinds of transfer like gift and lease.This latter line of reasoning found favour with the majority of a Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court in the case ofSheikh Kudratulla v. Mahini Mohan(1), (1) Beng. L.R. (Full Bench Rulings) page 134.77 where the question arose whether, when a Muhammadan sold his property to a Hindu purchaser the cosharer ofthe former could enforce a right of pre-emption against the Hindu vendee under the Muhammadan Law. Thequestion was answered in the negative by the majority of the Full Bench and Mitter J. who delivered the leadingjudgment, while discussing the nature of the right of pre-emption observed as follows:"" If that right is founded on an antecedent defect in the title of the vendor, that is to say on a legal disability on hispart to sell his property to a stranger, without giving an opportunity to his coparceners and neighbours to purchaseit in the ﬁrst instance, those coparceners and neighbours are fully entitled to ask the Hindu purchaser to surrenderthe property, for although as a Hindu, he is not necessarily bound by the Mahomedan Law, he was at any ratebound by the rule of justice, equity and good conscience to inquire into the title of his vendor; and that very rulealso requires that we should not permit him to retain a property which his vendor had no power to sell. If, on thecontrary, it can be shown, that there was no such defect in the title of the vendor, or in other words that he wasunder no such disability, even under the Mahomedan Law itself, it would follow as a matter of course, that therewas no-defect in the title of the purchaser, at the time of its creation........... Now, so far as I can judge of theMahomedan Law of pre-emption from the materials within my reach, it appears to me to be perfectly clear that aright of pre-emption is nothing more than a mere right of re- purchase, not from the vendor but from the vendee,who is treated, for all intents and purposes, as the full legal owner of the property which is the subject-matter ofthat right."" The minority judges consisting of Norman and Macpherson JJ.took a diﬀerent view and held that the law of pre-emption was to be treated as a real law, that is a law aﬀectingand attaching to the property itself. The liability to the claim of pre-emption is a quality impressed upon andinherent in the property which is subjected to it; or in other words an incident of that property.78 The identical point came up for consideration before a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court(1), where also thequestion for decision was whether a Muhammadan pre-emptor could enforce his right against a Hindu vendeefrom a Muhammadan vendor. The learned Judges took a view contrary to that taken by the majority of the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/52. h/0209595195i95wwwiiase95tml48 9/12/2SHRI AUDH BEHARI SINGH V. GAJA DHAR JAIPURIA & ORS [ 14] INSC 52; AIR 14 SC 47; 15 SCR 70 (23 Aprl 14)Calcutta Full Bench and answered the question in the aﬃrmative. It was held that the right of pre-emption was notone of re-purchase from the vendee. It -was a right inherent in the property and hence could be followed in thehands of the purchaser whoever he might be. Mr. Justice Mahmood elaborately reviewed all the originalauthorities of Muhammadan Law on the point and expressed the opinion that the right of pre-emption underMuhammadan Law partakes strongly of the nature of an easement right, the dominant tenement "" and the""servient tenement of the law of easement being analogous to what the learned Judge described respectively asthe "" pre-emptive tenement "" and "" preemptional tenement."" in other words the right of pre-emption is a sort oflegal servitude running with the land. The right exists, as the learned Judge said, in the owner of the pre-emptivetenement for the time being which entitles him to have an oﬀer of sale made to him, whenever the owner of thepre-emptional property desires to sell it. But the right could not be a right of re-purchase either from the vendor orthe vendee involving a new contract of sale. "" It is simply a right of substitution entitling the pre-emptor, by reasonof a legal incident to which the sale itself was subject, to stand in the shoes of the vendee in respect of all the rightsand obligations arising from the sale under which he has derived his title.It is in eﬀect, as if in a sale deed the vendee's name was rubbed out and the pre-emptor's name was substituted inits place. The learned Judge pointed out that the decision of the Calcutta Full Bench was based upon a mis-translation of the Arabic word "" Tajibo "" in Hamilton's Hedaya. Hamilton translated the word as meaning""established"" but it really means "" becomes obligatory, necessary or (1) Vide Govinda Dayal v. Inayatulla, 7 All. 775.79 enforceable."" The right has not got to be established at all. It is attached and continues to be attached to thetenement concerned and can under certain circumstances be enforced forthwith against the adjoining tenementssold.This decision was followed by the Patna High Court in Achyutananda v. Biki (1). A Division Bench of the BombayHigh Court in a case decided in 1928 (2) accepted the view taken by the majority of the Calcutta Full Bench but thereasons given in that decision were held to be unsupportable by a later Fall Bench (3) of the same High Court whichheld the right of preemption to be an incident of property and agreed substantially with the view taken byMahmood J. in the Allahabad Full Bench.In our opinion it would not be 'correct to say that the right of pre-emption under Muhammadan Law is a personalright on the part of the pre-emptor to get a re-transfer of the property from the vendee who has already becomeowner of the same. We prefer to accept the meaning of the word "" Tajibo "" used in the Hedaya in the sense inwhich Mr.Justice Mahmod construes it to mean and it was really a mis- translation of that word by Hamilton that accountedto a great extent for the view taken by the Calcutta High Court.It is true that the right becomes enforceable only when there is a sale but the right exists antecedently to the sale,the foundation of the right being the avoidance of the inconveniences and disturbances which would arise fromthe introduction of a stranger into the land. We agree with Mr.Justice Mahmood that the sale is a condition precedent not to the existence of the right but to its enforceability.We do not however desire to ex-press any opinion on the view taken by the learned Judge that the right of pre-emption partakes strongly of the character of an easement in law.Analogies are not always helpful and even if there is resemblance between the two rights, the diﬀerences betweenthem are no less material. The correct legal position seems (1) 1 Pat. 578.(2) Vide Hamed Miya v. Benjamin, 53 BOm. 525.(3) Vide Dasharathilal v. Bai Dhondu Bai, I.L.R. 1941 Bom.460.80 to be that the law of pre-emption imposes a limitation or disability upon the ownership of a property to theextent that it restricts the owner's unfettered right of sale and compels him to sell the property to his cosharer orneighbour as the case may be. The person who is a co-sharer in the land or owns lands in the vicinity consequentlygets an advantage or beneﬁt corresponding to the burden with which the owner of the property is saddled; eventhough it does not amount to an actual interest in the property sold..liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/52. h/0209595195i95wwwiiase95tml58 9/12/2SHRI AUDH BEHARI SINGH V. GAJA DHAR JAIPURIA & ORS [ 14] INSC 52; AIR 14 SC 47; 15 SCR 70 (23 Aprl 14)The crux of the whole thing is that the beneﬁt as well as the burden of the right of pre-emption run with the landand can be enforced by or against the owner of the land for the time being although the right of the pre-emptordoes not amount to an interest in the land itself. It may be stated here that if the right of preemption had beenonly a personal right enforceable against the vendee and there was no inﬁrmity in the title of the owner restrictinghis right of sale in a certain manner, a bona ﬁde purchaser without notice would certainly obtain an absolute titleto the property, unhampered by any right of the pre-emptor and in such circumstances there could be nojustiﬁcation for enforcing the right of pre-emption against the purchaser on grounds of justice, equity and goodconscience on which grounds alone the right could be enforced at the present day. In our opinion the law of pre-emption creates a right which attaches to the property and on that footing only it can be enforced against thepurchaser.The question now arises as to what is the legal position when the right is claimed not under Muhammadan Law buton the footing of a custom. It cannot be and is not disputed that if the right of pre-emption is set, up by non-Muslims on the basis of a custom, the existence of the custom is a matter to be established by proper evidence.But as has been laid down by the Judicial Committee (1) following the decision of the Calcutta High Court in FakirRawat v. Emman (2), that when the existence of a custom under which the Hindus (1) Vide Jadutal v. Janki Koer, 39.I. A. 101, (2) 1863 B.L.R. Sup. VOl. 35.81 claim to have the same rights of pre-emption as Muhammadans, in any district, is generally known andjudicially recognised, it is not necessary to prove it by further evidence. A long course of decisions has esta- blishedthe existence of such custom in Bihar, Sylhet and certain parts of Gujerat.So far as the present case is concerned, a large number of judgments have been put in evidence by the plaintiﬀ inproof of the existence of a custom of preemption in -the entire city of Banaras. There are at least three reportedcases (1) in which the High Court of Allahabad has aﬃrmed the existence of such rights in Banaras. The defendantsin the present case do not dispute the existence of the custom and the whole dispute is as regards the incidents ofthe same, the defendants' case being that the custom is available as between persons who are natives of ordomiciled in the place and cannot be extended to an outsider even though he owns property in the city which isthe subject- matter of the claim.The Privy Council in Jadhulal v. Janki Koer expressly laid down that when a custom of pre-emption is establishedby evidence to prevail amongst non-Muslims in a particular locality ""it must be presumed to be founded on and co-extensive with the Muhammadan Law on that subject unless the contrary is shown; that the Court may asbetween Hindus ad- minister a modiﬁcation of the law as to the circumstances under which the right may beclaimed when it is shown that the custom in that respect does not go to the whole length of the MuhammadanLaw of preemption, but that the assertion of right by suit must always be preceded by an observance of thepreliminary forms prescribed in the Muhammadan Law which forms appear to have been invariably observed andinsisted on through the whole of the cases from the earliest times of which we have record."" In the case before usno attempt was made by the defendants to show that the custom of pre-emption set up (i) Vide Chakauri Devi v.Sundari DeVi, 28 All- 590; Ram Chandra v. Goswami Ram Puri, 45 All. 501 ; Gouri Sankar v, Sitaram, 54 All. 76.(2) 39 I.A. 101.11 82 and proved by the plaintiﬀ was of a character diﬀerent from that which is contemplated by MuhammadanLaw. The only diﬀerence that is noticed in one of the decided authorities (1) is that the custom of pre-emptionprevalent in the city of Banaras is conﬁned to house properties only and does not extend to vacant lands; but thisview again has been modiﬁed in a subsequent decision(2) which held that building sites and small parcels of landeven though vacant are not excluded from the ambit of the custom. The various judgments which have been madeexhibits in this case do not give any indication whatsoever that under the custom, as it prevails in the city ofBanaras, pre-emption could be claimed only against persons who are the inhabitants of the place or are domiciledtherein and that it could not be enforced in respect of a property situated in the city, the owner of which is not anative of that place. In fact no such question was raised or discussed in any of these cases.The ambit or extent of a custom is a matter of proof and the defendants were certainly competent to adduceevidence to show that the custom of pre-emption prevailing in the city of Banaras was available not against allpersons who held lands within it, but only against a particular class of persons. But this they did not attempt to doat any stage of the litigation. Their contention, which has been accepted by both the Courts below is, that, as amatter of law, a local custom of pre-emption does not aﬀect or bind persons who are not the natives of ordomiciled in that area. In support of this proposition the Courts below have relied primarily upon the statement of.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/52. h/0209595195i95wwwiiase95tml68 9/12/2SHRI AUDH BEHARI SINGH V. GAJA DHAR JAIPURIA & ORS [ 14] INSC 52; AIR 14 SC 47; 15 SCR 70 (23 Aprl 14)law made by Roland Wilson and other text book writers on Muhammadan Law which purport to be based uponcertain decided authorities.At page 391 of his book on Anglo-Mahammadan Law(3) Roland Wilson states the law in the following manner:""Where the custom is judicially noticed as prevailing, amongst non-Muhammadans in a certain local area, (1) VideRam Chandra v. Goswami, 45 All. 501.(2) Vide Goari Sankar v. Sitallam, 54 All. 76.(3) Vide 6th edition, paragraph 352.83 it does not govern non-Muhammadans who, though holding land therein for the time being, are neither nativesof, nor domiciled in, the district."" Two cases have been referred to in support of this proposition, one of which isByjnath Pershad v. Kapilmon Singh(1) and the other Parsashth Nath Tewari v. Dhanai(2).Mulla repeats the law almost, in the same terms in his Muhammadan Law. In Tyabji the rule is thus laid down(3):""The law of pre-emption is personal. It is not territorial, nor an incident of property. A person who is not a native ofor domiciled within a locality where pre-emption is enforced by law or custom but who owns lands within the samelocality will not necessarily be subject to the law of pre- emption."" This statement clearly indicates the foundationof the whole doctrine. The law of pre-emption is stated to be a purely personal law even when it rests on custom. Itis no incident of property and the right which it creates is enforceable only against persons who belong to aparticular religious community or fulﬁl the description of being natives of a particular district. In the case ofByjnath Pershad v. Kapilmon Singh(1), which can be said to be the leading pronouncement on the subject, thevendor of a house situated in the town of Arah, in the province of Bihar, was one Rajani Kanta Banerjee who was anative of lower Bengal but resided at Arah where he carried on the profession of a lawyer. Rajani Kanta sold theproperty to the defendant, and the plaintiﬀ brought a suit claiming pre-emption on the ground of vicinage. It wasadmitted that the custom of pre- emption did prevail amongst non-Muslims in Bihar, but still the suit wasdismissed on the ground that the vendor, who was not a native of the district, was not bound by it. The right ofpre-emption, it was held, arises from a rule of law by which the owner of the land is bound and it no longer exists ifhe ceases to be an owner, who is bound by the law either as a Muhammadan or by custom.(1) 2 4 W. R., 95.(2) 32 Cal. 988 (3) Tyabji's Muhammadan Law, page 670, paragraph 523(e).84 In our opinion the decision proceeds upon a wrong assumption. The right of pre-emption, as we have alreadystated, is an incident of property and attaches to the land itself. As between Muhammadans the right undoubtedlyarises out of their personal law; but that is because the law of pre-emption is no part of the general law in India.Muhammadans live scattered all over our country and unless the right of pre-emption is regarded as part of theirpersonal law they would lose the beneﬁt of it altogether.Hence if a Muhammadan owns land in any local area and has co-sharers or neighbouring proprietors who are alsoMuhammadans, a right of pre-emption would accrue to the latter under the personal law of the Muhammadans,which is enforced in this country since the British days on grounds of equity, justice and good conscience. Butthough arising out of personal law the right of pre-emption is not a personal right; it is a real right attaching to theland itself. When the right is created by custom it would, be, as the Privy Council, has said, co-extensive with theright under Muhammadan Law unless the contrary is proved. This means that the nature and incidents of the rightare the same in both cases. In both it creates a right in the property and not a mere personal claim against thevendor or the vendee and the essential pre-requisites to the exercise of the right and the terms of enforcement areidentical in both But this does not mean that the customary right must be personal to the inhabitants of aparticular locality. It may be so, if that is the incident of the custom itself as established by evidence, but nototherwise. Under Muhammadan Law the right is conﬁned to persons of a particular religious persuasion because ithas its origin in the Muhammadan Law which is no longer a law of the land.But when it is the creature of a custom the religious persuasion of the parties or the community' to which theybelong are. altogether immaterial. All that is necessary to prove in such cases is that the right of pre-emption isrecognised in a particular locality and once this is established, the land belonging to every person in the locality.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/52. h/0209595195i95wwwiiase95tml78 9/12/2SHRI AUDH BEHARI SINGH V. GAJA DHAR JAIPURIA & ORS [ 14] INSC 52; AIR 14 SC 47; 15 SCR 70 (23 Aprl 14)would be subject to the custom, irrespective of his being a member of a particular 85 community or group. Thewhole doctrine, as enunciated above, is based upon the fallacious assumption that the right of pre-emption is apersonal right arising out of certain personal conditions of the parties like religion, nationality or domicile and thisfallacy crept into our law simply because the right of pre-emption as between Muhammadans is administered as apart of their personal law in our country.The correct legal position must be that when a right of pre- emption rests upon custom it becomes the lex loci orthe law of the place and aﬀects all lands situated in that place irrespective of the religion or nationality or domicileof the owners of the lands except where such incidents are proved to be a part of the custom itself.it appears that the decision in Byjnath. Kapilmon(1), which was quite in accordance with the view then taken bythe High Court of Calcutta about the nature of the right of pre- emption, was the basis of the statement of law inthe form set out above in an earlier edition of Roland Wilson's book.The decision in Parslashth Nath v. Dhanai(2), which is the other authority referred to, is based entirely upon thestatement of law in that earlier edition, and does not carry the matter any further. In our opinion these decisionscannot be held to be correct and the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant should be given eﬀect to.We accordingly hold that a local custom of preemption exists in the city of Banaras and the right attaches at leastto all house properties situated within it and no incident of such custom is proved which would make the rightavailable only between persons who are either natives of Banaras or -are domiciled therein. The result is that theappeal is allowed and the judgments of both the Courts below are set aside. The case shall go back to the HighCourt for consideration of the two questions left undecided by it, namely, whether the plaintiﬀ has made thedemands in due compliance with the forms prescribed by the Muhammadan Law and secondly whether theplaintiﬀ, being a landlord, (1) 24 W.R. 95.(2) 32 Cal 988.86 could eject his own tenants in exercise of the right of pre- emption. The appellant will have the costs of thisappeal from respondent No. 1. Further costs will abide the result.Appeal allowed."

JADUMONI MANGARAJ & ORS [1954] INSC 53; AIR 1954 SC 411; 1955 SCR 140 (25 April 1954).pdf,"Held, that the Supreme Court does not, when hearing appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution, sit as a Courtof further appeal on facts, and does not interfere with ﬁndings given on a consideration of evidence, unless theyare perverse or based on no evidence and this is particularly so when the ﬁndings under challenge are those ofElection Tribunals.The rights under litigation in election proceedings are not common law rights but rights which owe their existenceto statutes and the extent of those rights must be determined by reference to the statutes which create them.The proviso to section 85 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, does not contemplate the ElectionCommission giving to the respondent notice of the petition for condonation of the delay, or the holding of anenquiry as to the suﬃciency of the grounds in his presence before passing an order under it. The policy underlyingthe provision is to treat the question of delay as one between the Election Commission and the petitioner, and tomake the decision of the Election Commission on the question ﬁnal and not open to question at any later stage ofthe proceedings.Under section 90(4) of the Act, when the petition does not comply with the requirements of section 81, section 83or section 117, the Election Tribunal has a discretion either to dismiss it or not, ""notwithstanding anythingcontained in section 85"". The scope of the power conferred on the Election Tribunal under section 90(4) is that itoverrides the power conferred on the Election Commission under section 86 to dismiss the petition. It does notextend further and include a power in the Election Tribunal to review any order passed by the Election Commissionunder section 85 of the Act. The words of section 90(4) are, ""notwithstanding anything contained in section 85""and not ""notwithstanding anything contained in section 85 or any order passed thereunder"". An order of theElection Commission under section 85 dismissing a petition as barred will, under the scheme of the Act, be ﬁnal,and the same result must follow under section 90(4) when the order is one excusing the delay. Section 90(4) will beattracted only when the Election Commission passes the petition on to the Tribunal 141 without passing any orderunder section 85. If the Election Commission can thus pass a ﬁnal order condoning delay without notice to therespondent, there is no reason why it should not pass such an order suo motu. In this respect, the position under.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/53. h/02095951954i95wwwiiase95tml15 9/12/2DINABANDHU SAHU V.

The ElectionCommission might therefore be trusted to pass the appropriate order when there is avoidable and unreasonabledelay. That a power might be liable to be abused is no ground for denying it, when the statute confers it, andwhere there is an abuse of power by statutory bodies the parties aggrieved are not without remedies under thelaw.While the proviso to section 85 requires that ""the person making the petition"" should satisfy the ElectionCommission that there was suﬃcient cause for delay, it does not require that he should do so in person.Jagan Nath v.

Patnaik and Ratnaparkhi Anant Govind, with him) for respondent No. 2.1954. April 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This is an appeal by specialleave against the order of the Election Tribunal, Cuttack, setting aside the election of the appellant to theLegislative Assembly, Orissa, from the Kendrapara 142 Constituency. Four persons, the appellant and respondentsNos. 1 to 3, were duly nominated for election to the seat.One of them, Loknath Das (the third respondent herein), withdrew his candidature, leaving the contest to theother three. At the election which was held between 9th and 15th January, 1952, the appellant secured the largestnumber of votes and was declared elected. The respondent Jadumoni Mangaraj, then presented a petition undersection 81 of the Representation of the people (Act No. XLIII of 1951) alleging various corrupt practices on the partof the appellant, and praying that at the election might be set aside. The last date for presenting the petition was4th April, 1952. It was delivered at the post oﬃce at Cuttack on 3rd April, 1952, for being sent by registered post,and actually reached the Election Commission at Delhi on 5th April, 1952, a day beyond the period prescribed. Itwas also defective in its veriﬁcation. Section 83(1) of the Act enacts that the petition should be veriﬁed in themanner laid down in the Civil Procedure Code for the veriﬁcation of the pleadings. Order VI, rule 15, sub- clause(2), of the Civil Procedure Code provides that ""the person verifying shall specify by reference to the numberedparagraphs of the pleading what he veriﬁes on his own knowledge and what he veriﬁes upon information receivedand believed to be true."" The veriﬁcation in the petition did not specify which of the paragraphs were veriﬁed onpersonal knowledge and which on information received and believed to be true. On 2nd July, 1952, the ElectionCommission passed an order condoning the delay in the presentation of the petition. By another communication,dated 3rd July, 1952, it drew the attention of the peti- tioner to the defect in the veriﬁcation, and suggested that hemight apply to the Tribunal for amending it. On 15th July, 1952 an order was passed under section 86 of the Actappointing the Election Tribunal, Cuttack, for the hearing of the petition. The petitioner then applied to theElection Tribunal for amending the veriﬁcation. That was ordered, and the veriﬁcation was amended on 24th July,1952, so as to conform to the prescriptions laid down in Order VI, rule 15(2), of the Civil Procedure Code.143 In the written statement ﬁled by the appellant, he raised the contention that as the petition was presented outof time and as the veriﬁcation was defective, it was liable to be dismissed by the Election Commission undersection 85 of the Act, and that, in consequence, the Election Tribunal ought to dismiss it as not maintainable.Disagreeing with this contention, the Election Tribunal proceeded to hear the petition on the merits, and by itsjudgment dated 16th November, 1953, it held by a majority that three of the corrupt practices set out in the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/53. h/02095951954i95wwwiiase95tml25 9/12/2DINABANDHU SAHU V. JADUMONI MANGARAJ & ORS [14] INSC 53; AIR 14 SC 41; 15 SCR 10 (25 Aprl 14)petition had been established against the appellant. They were (1) that the appellant had, in violation of section123(1) of the Act, induced the third respondent to withdraw from the election on a promise to get himemployment; (2) that he had, in breach of section 123(6) of the Act, used Bus No. O.R.C.1545 for convoying the electors to polling booths; and (3) that he had, in contravention of section 123(8) of the Act,obtained the assistance of Extra Departmental Agents in branch post oﬃces and of Presidents of Choukidari Unionin canvassing for him in the election, they being in the view of the 'Election Tribunal, Government servants asdeﬁned in that provision. On these ﬁndings, the Election Tribunal passed an order setting aside the election of theappellant.The matter now comes before us on special leave under article 136 of the Constitution.It is obvious that any one of these ﬁndings, if accepted, would be suﬃcient to support the order of the ElectionTribunal. With reference to the last of the ﬁndings, it is possible to urge with some force that Extra DepartmentalAgents and Presidents of Chaukidari Union are not, having regard to their functions, Government servants, andthat accordingly there was no contravention of section 123(8).But the position is diﬀerent as regards the other two ﬁndings. They are pure questions of fact, depending onappreciation of evidence. Mr. Krishnaswami Ayyangar, learned counsel for the appellant, argued that theconclusion of the majority were not justiﬁed by the evidence or record, and that the ﬁndings of the third memberin his dissentient opinion were the right ones to come to 144 But this Court does not, when hearing appeals underarticle 136, sit as a Court of further appeal on facts, and does not interfere with ﬁndings given on a consideration ofthe evidence, unless they are perverse or based on no evidence.This is particularly so, when the ﬁndings under challenge are those of Election Tribunals. the ﬁndings in this casethat the appellant got the third respondent to withdraw on a promise to get him employment, and had used BusNo. O.R.C.1545 for conveying voters to the polling booths, are supported by the evidence, and cannot be characterised asperverse, and are therefore not open to attack in this appeal.in this view, counsel for the appellant concentrated on the issues relating to the maintainability of the petition. Hecontended that as the petition was not presented within the time as required by section 81 of the Act, it was liableto be dismissed under the mandatory provision in section 85, and that when the matter came before the ElectionTribunal, its jurisdiction was only to pass the order which the Election Commission ought to have passed, and thatthe petition should accordingly have been dismissed in limine us not maintainable. The proviso to section 85 of theAct runs as follows:""Provided that if a person making the petition satisﬁes the Election Commission that suﬃcient cause existed forhis failure to present the petition within the period prescribed therefor, the Election Commission may in itsdiscretion condone such failure."" It was in exercise of the discretion vested in it under this provision that theElection Commission condoned the delay by its order dated 2nd July, 1952. It is not disputed that if this order isvalid, there can be no question of dismissing the petition on the ground of delay. The contention of Mr.Krishnaswami Ayyangar is that the order is not valid, because it was passed not on any application of the partypraying that the delay might be excused but suo motu; and such an application, it is contended, is a condition tothe exercise of jurisdiction under that proviso, Support for this 145 contention was sought in the decisions undersection 5 of the Limitation Act, holding that it was incumbent, on the party praying that delay might be excusedunder that section to clearly allege and strictly prove the grounds therefor, We are not impressed by thiscontention. As was pointed, out by this Court in Jagan Nath v. Jaswant Singh(1), the rights under litigation in theseproceedings are not common law rights but rights which owe their existence to statutes, and the extent of thoserights must be determined by reference to the statutes which create them. The proviso to section 85 does notcontemplate the Election Commission giving to the respondent notice of the petition for con- donation of thedelay, or the holding of an enquiry as to the suﬃciency of the grounds in his presence before passing an orderunder it. The policy underlying the provision is to treat the question of delay as 'one between the ElectionCommission and the petitioner, and to make the decision of the Election Commission on the question ﬁnal and notopen to question at any later stage of the proceedings. Under section 90(4) of the Act, when the petition does notcomply with the requirements of section 81, section 83 or section 117, the Election Tribunal has a discretion eitherto dismiss it or not, "" notwithstanding anything contained in section 85."" The scope of the power conferred on the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/53. h/02095951954i95wwwiiase95tml35 9/12/2DINABANDHU SAHU V. JADUMONI MANGARAJ & ORS [14] INSC 53; AIR 14 SC 41; 15 SCR 10 (25 Aprl 14)Election Tribunal under section 90(4) is that it overrides the power conferred on the Election Commission undersection 85 to dismiss the petition. It does not extend further and include a power in the Election Tribunal to reviewany order passed by the Election Commission under section 85 of the Act. The words of section 90(4) are, it shouldbe marked, ""notwithstanding anything contained is section 85 "" and not ""notwithstanding anything contained insection 85 or any order passed thereunder."" An order of the Election Commission under section 85 dismissing apetition as barred will-,, under the scheme of the Act, be ﬁnal, and the same result must follow under section 90(4)when the order is one excusing the delay. Section 90(4) will be attracted only when the Election Commissionpasses the petition (1) [ 1954] INSC 5; A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 210 19 146 on to the Tribunal without passing any orderunder section85. If the Election Commission can thus pass a ﬁnal order condoning delay without notice to the respondent, thereis no reason why it should not pass such an order suo motu. In this respect, the position under the proviso tosection 85 is materially diﬀerent from that under section 5 of the Limitation Act, under which an order excusingdelay is not ﬁnal, and is liable to be questioned by the respondent at a later stage. [ Vide the decision of the PrivyCouncil in Krishnasami Panikondar v. Ramasami Chettiar(1)].It was argued that in this view the respondent would be without remedy even if the Election Commission shouldchoose to condone delays-it might be of years-, and that that would result in great hardship. But the provisoadvisedly confers on the Election Commission wide discretion in the matter, and the obvious intention of theLegislature was that it should be exercised with a view to do justice to all the parties. The Election Commissionmight therefore be trusted to pass the appropriate order when there is avoidable and unreasonable delay. That apower might be liable to be abused is no ground for denying it, when the statute confers it, and where there is anabuse of power by statutory bodies, the parties aggrieved are not without ample remedies under the law. Withparticular reference to the order dated 2nd July, 1952, it is diﬃcult to come to any conclusion other than that inpassing that order the discretion under the proviso to section 85 has been properly exercised. The petition hadbeen presented at the post oﬃce one day earlier, and reached the Election Commission one day later than the duedate. Even if the matter had to be judged under section 5 of the Limitation Act, it would have been a properexercise of the power under that section to have excused the delay. As was observed in the Full Bench ,decision inKrishna v. Chathappan(2), in a passage which has become classic, the words ""Suﬃcient cause"" should receive ""aliberal construction so as to advance substantial justice when no negligence nor inaction nor want of bona ﬁdes isimputable to the appellant."" We (1) 45 I.A. 25.(2) I.L.R. 13 Mad. 269, 147 have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the order dated 2nd July, 1952, is on thefacts a proper one to pass under the proviso to section 85.It wag also argued for the appellant that the power conferred by the proviso to section 85 could, on its trueconstruction, be exercised only when the petitioner moved the matter in person, and as the Election Tribunal hadfound that that was not done, there was no jurisdiction in the Election Commission to pass the order which it did.We do not see anything in the language of the section to support this contention. While the proviso requires that""the person making the petition "" should satisfy the Election Commission that there was suﬃcient cause for delay,it does not require that he should do so in person. And there is. nothing in the character of the proceedingsrequiring that the petitioner should make the representations under that proviso in person. It is only a question ofsatisfying the Election Commission that there was suﬃcient ground for excusing the delay, and that could be doneotherwise than by the personal appearance of the petitioner. None of the objections advanced against the validityof the order dated 2nd July, 1952, being tenable, the contention that the petition was liable to be dismissed undersection 85 as presented out of time must be rejected.There is another ground on which also the contention of the appellant that the petition is not maintainable shouldfail.When the election petition came before the Election Tribunal by virtue of the order under section 86 of the Act,the appellant moved for its dismissal under section 90(4) on the grounds, ﬁrstly that it was not presented withinthe time prescribed by section 81, and secondly, that it was not veriﬁed in accordance with section 83; but theElection Tribunal declined to do so. If it was within the competence of the Election Tribunal to pass such an order,that would itself furnish a complete answer to the contention of the appellant that the petition was notmaintainable. Mr.Krishnaswami Ayyangar sought to get over this diﬃculty by contending that the order of the Election Commissionsending the petition for hearing by the 148 Election Tribunal under section 86 of the Act, was without jurisdiction,.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/14/53. h/02095951954i95wwwiiase95tml45 9/12/2DINABANDHU SAHU V. JADUMONI MANGARAJ & ORS [14] INSC 53; AIR 14 SC 41; 15 SCR 10 (25 Aprl 14)because an order under that section could be passed only when the petition is not liable to be dismissed undersection 85 as when the requirements of sections 81, 83 or 117 are complied with ; but that when those provisionsare not complied with, its only power under that Act was to dismiss it under section 85; that, in consequence, theElection Tribunal acquired no jurisdiction to hear the petition by virtue of that order, and that all the proceedingstaken under it culminating in the order now under appeal were a nullity. This contention is, in our judgment, whollyuntenable. The jurisdiction to pass an order under section 86 arises ""if the petition is not dismissed under section85."" That has reference to the factual position whether the the petition was, in fact, dismissed under section 85and not to the legal position whether it was liable to be dismissed. That is the plain meaning of the words of thesection, and that is made plainer by section 90(4) which provides that, Not withstanding anything contained insection 85, the Tribunal may dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of section 81,section 83 or section 117."" This provision clearly contemplates that petitions which are liable to be dismissed fornon-compliance with sections 81, 83 or 117 might not have been so dismissed, and provides that when suchpetitions come before the Election Tribunal, it is a matter of discretion with it to dismiss them or not.The power of the Election Tribunal to condone delay in presentation or defective veriﬁcation is thus unaﬀected bythe consideration whether that petition was liable to be dismissed by the Election Commission under section 85.The eﬀect of an order under section 90(4) declining to dismiss the petition on the ground of delay or defectiveveriﬁcation is clearly to condone those defects.In the instant case, with reference to the, plea of limi- tation the position stands thus: The delay was condoned bythe Election Commission under the proviso to section 85, and by reason of, that order, the question 149 is,asalready held no longer open to consideration at any later stage. Even assuming for the sake of argument that theElection Commission had no jurisdiction to pass an order of condonation suo motu, and further accepting theﬁnding of the Election Commission that the order dated 2nd July, 1952, was so made, and that it was therefore anullity, when the matter came before the Election Tribunal by transfer under section 86, it had jurisdiction to passappropriate orders under section 90(4), and its order declining to dismiss the petition is suﬃcient to condone thedefect.The position as regards veriﬁcation is slightly diﬀerent.There is no provision corresponding to the proviso to section 85 conferring express power on the ElectionCommission to permit amendment of the veriﬁcation. Whether it has inherent power to permit such amendment,it is not necessary to decide, because when it did not, in fact, dismiss the petition under section 85 for notcomplying with section 83 and passed an order under section 86 appointing an Election Tribunal for the hearing ofthe petition, the matter is thereafter governed by section 90(4) of the Act, and it is a matter of discretion with theElection Tribunal either to dismiss the petition for defective veriﬁcation or not. In the present case, the ElectionTribunal directed the veriﬁcation to be amended on 24 July, 1952, and further declined to dismiss the petitionunder section 90(4) for defective veriﬁcation. These are not orders with which this Court will interfere in appealunder article 136 of the Constitution.The objection to the maintainability of the petition on the ground of delay in presentation and of defectiveveriﬁcation must therefore be overruled, and this appeal dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed."

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BAAGWATI J.-This is an appeal against the judgmentand decree of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta reversing the order of the Third Subordinate Judge, Alipore,dismissing the respondents applications for re-restoration of certain immovable properties.One Romesh Chandra Acharji Choudhury (deceased) predecessor- in-interest of the appellants borrowed on the16th August, 1918, Rs. 1,60,000 and Rs, 73,000 from the predecessors-in- interest of the respondents under twodeeds of mortgage.There being default in payment of the mortgage amounts a suit to realise the mortgage securities was ﬁled on the10th March, 1926, 152 in the Third Subordinate Judge's Court, Alipore. A preliminary mortgage decree for Rs.4,21,851.1-6 was passed on the 4th April, 1929, and a decree absolute for sale was passed on the 13th September,1929. The mortgaged properties were put up for sale in execution proceedings in 1930 and the decree-holderspurchased the properties at auction sales on the 29th February, 1932, and the 23rd April, 1935, for an aggregateamount of Rs. 2,35,200. These sales were duly conﬁrmed and the auction-purchasers took delivery of possessionof diﬀerent items of property on diﬀerent dates between the 25th June, 1933, and the 9th March, 1936. Theaecree-holders obtained on the 13th December, 1937, a personal decree under Order XXXIV, rule 6, of the CivilProcedure Code for the balance due to them, viz., Rs, 3,30,903. This personal decree was also executed and someproperties of the mortgagors were purchased by the decree-holders on the 8th August, 1939, for Rs. 3,899 anddelivery of possession of these properties was duly given to them on the 6th July, 1940.Kshitish Chandra Acharji Choudhury, since deceased, the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants Nos. 1 to 3 andJyotish Chandra Acharya Choudhury, the appellant No. 4, sons of the mortgagor ﬁled on the 9th December, 1940,a petition under section 36 of the Bengal Money Lenders Act (Act X of 1940) for reopening the mortgage decreeand the personal decree. By an order dated the 25th August, 1941, the learned Subordinate Judge reopened thedecrees and on the 10th May, 1943, passed a new decree for a sum of Rs.3,76,324-12-4. The said sum was directed to be paid by the judgment-debtors to the decree-holders in ﬁfteenequal annual instalments. He also directed the restoration of the properties purchased by the decree-holders.The present respondents preferred, on the 19th June, 1943, an appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Calcuttaand cross-objections were ﬁled by the said Kshitish Chandra Acharji Choudhury and appellant No. 4. By theirjudgment and decree dated the 29th June, 1944, the High Court aﬃrmed the decree of the Court below with somesubstantial variations and 153 passed a new decree in favour of the mortgagors. The mortgagees were ordered toput the mortgagors in possession of all the properties they had purchased in' execution of the reopened decreesand render to them an account of the mesne proﬁts of those properties from the 15th September, 1941, till theyrestored or relinquished possession to the mortgagors of the collection papers of those properties.The sum of Rs. 3,76,324-12-6 was declared to be due by the mortgagors to the mortgagees and the mortgagorswere to pay the same in twenty equal annual instalments the ﬁrst of such instalments to be paid on or before theﬁrst anniversary of the date on which the mortgagees restored or relinquished possession of all the properties.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/54.html/0209595095595www9525 9/12/2SRIMA TI ASHALATA DEBI & ORS V.

The mortgagors were to pay to the mortgageesthe successive annual instalments on or before the same date of the succeeding years on which the ﬁrst instalmentbecame payable and they were also to pay the annual revenue of the aforesaid properties that would becomepayable after they were restored to possession kist by kist, as they fell due, at least three days before the kist datesand ﬁle the challans in the Court below in proof of payment within ten days of the payments. The road, publicworks and education cesses and rent due to the superior landlords were also to be paid similarly by the mortgagorsand in default of payment of any one instalment or cesses or rent within the time prescribed, the mortgagors wereentitled to get back possession of the said properties from the mortgagors and in that event the sum of Rs.2,39,099 at which the mortgagees had purchased those properties would be balanced against the amount thendue to them under the decree. If thereafter any amount still remained due to the mortgagees under the decreethey were entitled to apply in the Court below for a decree for the balance under Order XXXIV, rule 6, of the CivilProcedure Code. An enquiry was ordered into the mesne proﬁts for the period between the 15th September, 1941,till the restoration of possession to the mortgagors and 20 154 the mortgagors were at liberty to set oﬀ theamount that might be decreed in their favour for mesne proﬁts towards the instalment that fell due in the year inwhich the amount was declared by the Court below and the next succeeding years till the said amount was wipedoﬀ.Possession was delivered to the mortgagors on the 5th October, 1944. The delivery of the collection papers washowever given on the 28th March, 1945. The mortgagors were alleged to have committed default in the paymentof the second instalment which was due in any event on the 28th March, 1947, and also in the payment of therevenue kist and the cesses which were due on or about that date. The mortgagees therefore made applications inthe Court of the Third Subordinate Judge at Alipore on the 6th September, 1946, and the 18th April, 1947, askingfor re-restoration of the properties. Several defaults were alleged but only two defaults were pressed, one inregard to the payment of the second instalment which was due on the 28th March, 1947, and the other in regardto the payment of the revenue and the cesses of the Noakhali properties due also on the same date.The learned Subordinate Judge rejected these applications by his order dated the 27th September, 1947, holdingthat there was no default in the payment of revenue and cess and that the default in payment of the secondinstalment though it had accrued was due to the wrongful acts of the decree- holders themselves and that the,decree-holders were not entitled to take advantage of their own wrong. An appeal was preferred to the High Courtof Judicature at Calcutta.The appeal was allowed on the 27th April, 1950. The High Court held that a default had been committed by themortgagors and ordered rerestoration of the properties.This appeal has been ﬁled against that order of the High Court with certiﬁcate under article 133(1)(a) of theConstitution.Shri S. Ghosh appearing for the appellants before us urged that the bulk of the properties which were the subject-matter of the new decree had gone to Pakistan after the 26th January, 1950, being situated in East Pakistan andthe High Court at Calcutta had 155 after the 26th January., 1950, no jurisdiction and power to determine the appealand to pass an order relating to the immovable properties situated in foreign territories. He further urged that theorder of rerestoration of the properties was not appealable and that in any event no default had been committedby the mortgagors.In support of his ﬁrst contention reliance was placed on paragraph 4(2) of the Indian Independence (LegalProceedings) Order, 1947, which ran as under:--- ""4. Notwithstanding the creation of certain new Provinces andthe transfer of certain territories from the Province of Assam to the Province of East Bengal by the IndianIndependence Act, 1947...................(2) Any appeal or application for revision in respect of any proceedings so pending in any such Court shall lie in theCourt which would have appellate, or as the case may be revisional jurisdiction over that Court if the proceedingswere instituted in that Court after the appointed day;......... "" The applications for re-restoration of the propertieswere pending before the Third Subordinate Judge at Alipore on the 15th August., 1947, and they were saved by theprovisions of paragraph 4(1) which provided for the continuance in the same Court of these proceedings as if thesaid Act that is, Indian Independence Act, 1947, had not been passed. But he contended that paragraph 4(2) didnot save the appeal which had been ﬁled by the mortgagees after the 15th August, 1947. We cannot accept thiscontention of the appellant..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/54.html/0209595095595www9535 9/12/2SRIMA TI ASHALATA DEBI & ORS V.

This certainly couldnot be the meaning, because by reason of the transfer of the territories no proceedings in respect of the propertieswhich had gone to Pakistan' could ever have been maintained after the 15th August, 1947, in the Courtsconcerned. The only construction which could be put upon this provision was that the Court having appellate orrevisional jurisdiction over that Court would have such jurisdiction as if the proceedings had been instituted in thatCourt after the 15th August, 1947. For the purpose of the appellate or the revisional jurisdiction that Court had tobe treated as the Court in which the proceedings could and should have been instituted and it goes without sayingthat if the pro- ceedings could be treated as -having been properly instituted in that Court the only Court to whichthe appeal or the application for revision could lie was the Court which then had appellate or revisional jurisdictionover that Court. In the case before us no proceedings could have been instituted in the Third Subordinate Judge'sCourt at Alipore in respect of the properties which had gone to East Pakistan after the 15th August, 1947. But byreason of the fact that these proceedings were pending in that Court on the 15th August, 1947, the High Court ofCalcutta which had appellate or revisional jurisdiction over that Court was prescribed to be the Court in which theappeal or the application for revision in respect of such procedings would lie, because that Court, that is the ThirdSubordinate Judge's Court at Alipore, was treated as the Court in which such proceedings could and should havebeen instituted after the 15th August, 1947.Learned counsel for the respondents drew our attention to the case of Tirlok Nath v. Moti Ram and Others(1). Inthat case a suit for possession of land at place X was ﬁled in Court at B in 1943. On the 15th August, 1947, the suitwas pending before the Court at B which dismissed the suit in 1948. An appeal from the decision was ﬁled in theEast Punjab High Court as the place B was included in the East Punjab. On (1) A.I.R. 1050 East Punjab I49.157 objection regarding jurisdiction of the High Court being taken on the -around that the land in suit was at A,now included in Pakistan, the High,Court held that the suit being pending at place B on 15th August, 1947, appealfrom the decision of that Court lay to the East Punjab High Court and not to Lahore High Court under paragraph4(2) of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947. This decision is on all fours with the case beforeus and we are of the opinion that the contention urged on behalf of the appellants is untenable.The next contention of the appellants is equally untenable.The Calcutta High Court considered these applications as applications in the suit for a special remedy given undera special law and held that the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure applied and an appeal lay against the ordersbecause they were decrees within the deﬁnition of section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. We cannot accept thisreasoning. These applications were in truth and in substance applications for execution of the new decrees whichhad been passed in favour of the mortgagors by the High, Court on the 29th June, 1944. The only thing competentto the mortgagees under the terms of the new decree was to apply for execution of the decrees on defaultcommitted by the mortgagors and the applications made by the mortgagees in the Court of the Third SubordinateJudge at Alipore were really applications for execution of the decree though not couched in the proper form andcould be treated as such. If they were treated as such it is clear that the orders passed on such applications forexecution were appealable and no objection could be sustained on the ground that no appeals law against theseorders. Treating these applications therefore as applications for execution we see no substance in this contentionof the appellants.if the matter is approached in this way no objection could be urged by the appellants against the decision of theHigh Court. The executing Court could not go behind the decree and it is clear on the facts that default wascommitted by the mortgagors both in 158 regard to the payment of the revenue and the cess as also the secondinstalment under the new decree.The contention which was therefore urged on behalf of the appellants that there was no default committed by themortgagors also could not be sustained.The High Court of Judicature at Calcutta was therefore rightly seized of the appeal and it had jurisdiction to decidewhether the mortgagors had committed default in carrying out the terms of the new decree. The appeal being a.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/54.html/0209595095595www9545 9/12/2SRIMA TI ASHALATA DEBI & ORS V.

The question whether he would be able to obtainpossession of the immovable properties in fact was foreign to such an enquiry. By appropriate proceedings inanother jurisdiction he may be able to do so; but this diﬃculty could not be a deterrent to the High Court passingthe necessary orders for re-restoration of the properties.The appeal therefore fails and must stand dismissed.. There will be no order as to costs."
2267,"THE SALES TAX OFFICER, PILIBHIT V. MESSRS. BUDH PRAKASH JAI PRAKASH [1954] INSC 56; AIR 1954 SC 459; 1955 SCR 1133 (3 May 1954).pdf","Held, that there is a well-deﬁned and well-established distinction between a sale and an agreement to sell.The words ""Taxes on the sale of goods"" in entry No. 48, List II, Schedule VII of the Government of India Act, 1935,confer power on the Provincial Legislature to impose a tax only when there has been a completed sale and notwhen there is only an agreement to sell.Accordingly section 2(b) of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, XV of 1948, enlarging the deﬁnition of ""sale"" so as toinclude forward contracts must, to that extent, be declared ultra vires.For the same reason Explanation III to section 2(h) which provides that forward contracts ""shall be deemed to havebeen completed on the date originally agreed upon for delivery"" and section 3B of the Act must also be held to beultra vires.Colley v. Overseas Exporters ([ 1921] 3 K. B. 302 at 309, 310 referred to.","""Sale"" means within its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, any transfer of property -in goods forcash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration and includes forward contracts but does not include amortgage, hypothecation, charge or pledge."" It is the extended deﬁnition of sale as including forward contracts inthis section that is relied on as conferring authority on the appellant to make the orders in Exhibits A and B. Thepoint for decision in this appeal is whether the power to impose a tax on the sale of goods under entry 48 includesa power to impose a tax on forward contracts.245 Under the statute law of India which is based on English law on the subject, a sale of goods and an agreementfor the sale of goods are treated as two distinct and separate matters. Section 4 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act(Act III of 1930), runs as follows:(1) ""A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goodsto the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of sale between one part-owner and another.(2) A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.(3) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contractis called a sale, but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject tosome condition thereafter to be fulﬁlled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.(4) An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulﬁlled subject to which theproperty in the goods is to be transferred."" It will be noticed that though the section groups both sales andagreements to sell under the single generic name of ""contracts of sale"" following in this respect the scheme of theEnglish Sale of Goods Act, 1893, it treats them as separate categories, the vital point of distinction between thembeing that whereas in a sale there is a transfer of property in the goods from the seller to the buyer, there is none inan agreement to sell. When the contract is to sell future goods, and under section 6(3)of the Sale of Goods Acteven if ""the seller purports to eﬀect a present sale of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sellthe goods"", there can be no transfer 'of title to the goods until they actually' come into existence ; and even then,the conditions laid down in section 23 of the Act should be satisﬁed before the property in the goods can pass. Thatwas also the law under the repealed provisions in Chapter VII of the Indian Contract. Act, 1872. Section 77 of theContract Act deﬁned ""sale"" as follows:""Sale"" is the exchange of property for a price. It involves the transfer of the ownership of the thing sold from theseller to the buyer."" 246 Section 79 enacted that, ""Where there is a contract for the sale of a thing which has yet tobe ascertained, made or ﬁnished, the ownership of the thing is not transferred to the buyer, until it is ascertained,made or ﬁnished."" The corresponding provisions of the English Act are sections 1, 16 and rule 5 of section 18.Section I is as follows:(1)""A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goodsto the buyer for a money consideration, called the price.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 56.html/02095955959524 9/12/2THE SALES TAX OFFICER, PILIBHIT V. MESSRS. BUDH PRAKASH JAI PRAKASH [14] INSC 56; AIR 14 SC 49; 15 SCR…There may be a contract of sale between one part-owner and another.(2)A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.(3)Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer the contractis called a sale; but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject tosome condition thereafter to be fulﬁlled the contract is called an agreement to sell.(4)An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulﬁlled subject to which theproperty in the goods is to be transferred."" Section 16 enacts that, ""Where there is a contract for the sale ofunascertained goods no property -in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods areascertained."" Section 18, rule 5, provides for the passing of property is future goods after they are ascertained.The distinction between a sale and an agreement to sell under section 1 of the English Act is thus stated byBenjamin on Sale, Eighth Edition, 1950:""In order to constitute a sale there must be- (1)An agreement to sell, by which alone the property does not pass;and (2) an actual sale, by which the property passes. It will be observed that the deﬁnition of a contract of sale,above cited includes a mere agreement to sell as well as an actual sale."" 247 This distinction between sales andagreements to sell based upon the passing of the property in the goods is of great importance in determining therights of parties under a contract. The position is thus stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume 29, page 15,paragraph 13:""An agreement to sell, or, as it is often stated, an executory contract of sale, is a contract pure and simple, whereasa sale, or, as it is called for distinction, an executed contract of sale, is a contract plus a conveyance.Thus, by an agreement to sell a mere jus in personam is created, by a sale a jus in rem is transferred. Where goodshave been sold, and the buyer makes default in payment, the seller may sue for the contract price, but where anagreement to buy is broken, usually the seller's only remedy is an action for unliquidated damages. Similarly, if anagreement to sell be broken by the seller, the buyer has only a personal remedy against the seller. The goods arethe property of the seller and he can dispose of them. They may be taken in execution for his debts, and if hebecomes bankrupt they pass to his trustee in bankruptcy. But if there has been a sale, and the seller breaks hisengagement to deliver the goods, the buyer has not only a personal remedy against the seller, but also the usualproprietary remedies in respect of the goods them selves, such as the actions for conversion and detinue. Again, ifthere be an agreement for sale and the goods perish, the loss as a rule falls on the seller, while if there has been asale the loss as a rule falls upon the buyer."" Thus, there having existed at the time of the enactment of theGovernment of India Act, 1935, a welldeﬁned and well- established distinction between a sale and an agreement tosell it would be proper to interpret the expression sale of goods"" in entry 48 in the sense in which it was used inlegislation both in England and India and to hold that it authorises the imposition of a tax only when there is acompleted sale involving transfer of title.This conclusion is further strengthened, when regard is hood to the nature of the levy, Section 3 of the, Act 248provides for a tax being imposed at three pies in the rupee on the turnover of the assessee, and ""turnover"" isdeﬁned in section 2 (i) as ""the aggregate of the proceeds of sale by a dealer"", and that would consist of the priceand any charges paid at the time of the delivery of the goods, as provided in Explanation I. The substance of thematter is that the sales tax is a levy on the price of the goods, and the reason of the thing requires that such a levyshould not be made, unless the stage has been reached when the seller can recover the price under the contract. Itis well- settled that an action for price is maintainable only when there is a sale involving transfer of the property inthe goods to the purchaser. Where there is only an agreement to sell, then the remedy of the seller is to sue fordamages for breach of contract and not for the price of the goods.The law was thus stated in Colley v. Overseas Exporters(1):In former days an action for the price of goods would only lie upon one or other of two counts. First, upon theindebitatus count for goods sold and delivered, which was pleaded as follows: 'Money payable by the defendant tothe plaintiﬀ for goods sold and delivered by the plaintiﬀ to the defendants': Bullen and Leake, Precedents ofPleading, 3rd ed., p. 38. This count would not lie before delivery:Boulter v. Arnott(2). The count was applicable when upon a sale of goods the property has passed and the goodshad been delivered to the purchaser and the price was payable at the time of the action brought. Secondly, uponwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/ 56.html/02095955959534 9/12/2THE SALES TAX OFFICER, PILIBHIT V. MESSRS.

This count was applicable where upon a sale of 'goods the property had passed to thepurchaser and the contract had been completed in all respects except delivery, and the delivery was not a part ofthe consideration for the price or a condition precedent to its payment. If the property had not passed the countwould not lie: Atkinson v. Bell(3). In my view the law as to the (1) [ 1921] 3 K. B. 302 at 309 310, (2) (1833) 1 Cr, & M.333.(3) [ 1828] EngR 12; (1828) 8 B & C. 277, 249 circumstances under which an action will lie for the price of goods hasnot been changed by the Sale of Goods Act, 1893."" That is also the law in this country under section 55 of the Saleof Goods Act. The only exception to this rule is when, under an agreement between the parties, the price ispayable on a day certain irrespective of delivery, and that is not material for the purpose of the present discussion.The position therefore is that a liability to be assessed to sales tax can arise only if there is a completed sale underwhich price is paid or is payable and not when there is only an agreement to sell, which can only result in a claimfor damages. It would be contrary to all principles to hold that damages for breach of contract are liable to beassessed to sales tax on the ground that they are in the same position as sale price. The power conferred underentry 48 to impose a tax on the sale of goods can therefore be exercised only when there is a sale under whichthere is a transfer of property in the goods, and not when there is a mere agreement to sell. The State Legislaturecannot, by enlarging the deﬁnition of "" sale "" as including forward contracts, arrogate to itself a power which is notconferred upon it by the Constitution Act, and the deﬁnition of ""sale"" in section 2(h) of Act XV of 1948 must, tothat extent, be declared ultra vires. For the same reason, Explanation III to section 2(h) which provides thatforward contracts ""shall be deemed to have been completed on the date originally agreed upon for delivery"", andsection 3-B which enacts that, ""Notwithstanding anything contained in section 3, the turnover of any dealer inrespect of transactions of forward contracts, in which goods are not actually delivered, shall be taxed at a rate notexceeding rupees two per unit as may be prescribed "" must also be held to be ultra vires.In the result, the decision of the High Court must be aﬃrmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.Civil Appeal No. 23 of 1954.Appeal under article 133(1) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Decree dated the 28th February,1952, of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ Application No. 7297 of 1951.C.

The respondent is a ﬁrm doing business in forward contracts, and was assessed in respect of suchcontracts to a tax of Rs. 1,082-8-0 for the year 1948-1949 by an order dated 27th February, 1950, Exhibit A, and to atax of Rs. 7,369 for the year 1949-1950 by an order dated 23rd May, 1950, Exhibit B. For the period, 1st April, 1950,to 31st January, 1951, the respondent paid a sum of Rs. 845-4-0 as tax. Assessment proceedings were also startedby the appellant in respect of certain forward contracts relating to gur and peas. The respondent challenged thelegality of these proceedings and of the assessment orders on the ground that the Act in so far as it imposed a taxon forward contracts was ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature. The learned Judges agreed with thiscontention, and issued a writ of certiorari quashing the orders of assessment, Exhibits A and B, and a writ ofprohibition in respect of the proceedings for assessment of tax on forward contracts in gur and peas. The matternow comes before us in appeal under a certiﬁcate of the' High Court under article 133(1) of the Constitution.Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the Pro- vincial Legislature derived its power to impose a tax on the saleof goods under entry 48 in List 11 of the Seventh Schedule, and the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, XV of 1948, wasenacted in exercise of this power.

P. Verma for the appellant.C. P. Lal for the respondent.1954. May 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-Twenty-four persons, among them the twoappellants, were tried for oﬀences under sections 148, 307/149 and 302/149, Indian Penal Code. Sixteen wereacquitted and the remainmg eight were convicted. On appeal to the High Court ﬁve more were acquitted and theonly ones whose convictions were upheld were the two appellants, Nar Singh and Roshan Singh, and one NanhuSingh.By a curious misreading of the evidence this Nanhu Singh was mixed up with Bechan Singh. What the High Courtreally meant to do was to convict Bechan Singh and acquit Nanhu Singh. Instead of that they acquitted BechanSingh and convicted Nanhu Singh. As soon as the learned High Court Judges realised their mistake theycommunicated with the State Government and an order was thereupon passed by that Government remitting thesentence mistakenly Passed on Nanhu and directing that he be released.240 This occasioned an application under article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution by Nanhu Singh and the twoappellants Nar Singh and Roshan Singh for a certiﬁcate. The High Court rightly considered that the certiﬁcateshould issue in the case of Nanhu Singh because, despite the remission of his sentence by the State Governmentand his release, his conviction on, among other things, a charge of murder still stood, and the High Court,understandably, thought that the stigma of that might aﬀect him adversely in the future. As regards the other twothere was nothing in their cases to warrant the issue of a certiﬁcate but the learned High Court Judges thought(wrongly in our opinion) that they were bound to do so because article 134(1) (c) speaks of a "" case "" and theyconsidered that the only CC case "" before them was the appeal as a whole. That, in our opinion, is wrong."" Case "" as used there means the case of each individual person. That would be so even if the trial had been by theHigh Court itself but it is even more so on appeal because, though several persons may join in presenting acommon memorandum of appeal (if the Rules of the Court in question so permit), the appeal of each forms aseparate "" case "" for those purposes. That is obvious from the fact that every person who is convicted need notappeal nor need several convicts appeal at the same time under a joint memorandum;and if it were necessary to send up the "" case "" as a whole in the sense which the learned High Court Judgescontemplate, it would be necessary to join even those who were acquitted so that the "" case "" (in that sense) couldbe reviewed in its entirety. We are clear that that is not the meaning of the word in the context of article 134(1) andthat the High Court was wrong in thinking that it was.Having obtained the certiﬁcate Nanhu did not appeal and the only ones who have come up here are the twoconvicts. Had they come up independently and presented a petition for special leave under article 136 theirpetition would at once have been dismissed because there is nothing special in their cases to justify an appealunder that article. The evidence against them is clear and it has been believed, accordingly, following our usualrule, we would have rejected the 241 petition in limine. But, it was contended on their behalf that having obtaineda certiﬁcate we have now become an ordinary Court of appeal and are bound to hear their case as an appellateCourt both on facts and on law. Reliance was placed on a decision of the Federal Court reported in SubhanandChowdhary v. Apurba Krishna Mitra(1).We do not think the judgment of the Federal Court can be applied to this case. It deals with section 205 of theGovernment of India Act, 1935, covering a diﬀerent subject and does not use the same or similar words.This Court has general powers of judicial superintendence over all Courts in India and is the ultimate interpreterand guardian of the Constitution. It has a duty to see that its provisions are faithfully observed and, where.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/14/58.h/0209595595495wwwiiofindirasee95tml23 9/12/2NAR SINGH & ANR V.

A certiﬁcate is, requiredunder article 133(1). in each of the four cases set out there but the mere grant of the certiﬁcate would not precludethis Court from determining whether it was rightly granted and whether the conditions prerequisite to the grantare satisﬁed. In the case of clause (c) both of article 133(1) and article 134(1), the only condition is the discretion ofthe High Court but the discretion is a judicial one and must be judicially exercised along the well established lineswhich govern these matters (see Banarsi Parshad v. Kashi Krishna (2); also the certiﬁcate must show on the face ofit that the discretion conferred was invoked and exercised:Radhakrishna Ayyar v. Swaminatha Ayyar (3) and Radha Krishn Das v. Rai Krishn Chand (4). If it is properlyexercised on well established and proper lines, then, as in all questions where an exercise of discretion is involved,there would be no interference except on very strong grounds: Swaminarayan Jethalal v. AcharyaDevendraprasadji (5) and Bhagbati Dei v.Muralidhar Sahu (6). But if, on the face of the order, it is apparent that the Court has misdirected itself andconsidered that its discretion was (1) (1940] F.C.R. 31. (4) 28 I.A. 182 at 183.(2) 28 I.A. 11 at 13.

Kanshi Ram (1).These are the well known lines on which questions of discretion are dealt with in the superior Courts and theyapply with as much force to certiﬁcates under article 134(1) (c) as elsewhere.In the present case, the learned High Court Judges thought they had no option. They misdirected themselvesabout the law and as a consequence did not exercise the discretion which is vested in them. They are quite clear asto what they would have done if, in their judgment, the law had left them scope for the exercise of any discretion,for they say- "" Ordinarily no certiﬁcate can be granted to them as there is nothing of an exceptional nature in theircases. "" We hold therefore that the certiﬁcate was wrongly granted to the appellants and will treat their case asone under article 136(1) for special leave.Regarded from that angle, this is not a proper case for special leave. The High Court gives a clear ﬁnding that therewere more than ﬁve persons and believes the eye- witnesses who identify the two appellants. The mere fact thatonly two out of the band of attackers were satisfactorily identiﬁed does not weaken the force of the ﬁnding thatmore than ﬁve were involved. The use of section 149, Indian Penal Code, was therefore justiﬁed and theconvictions are proper.We see no reason to interfere with the sentences. A number of persons joined in an attack at two in the morningon helpless persons who were asleep in bed. At least one of the assailants was armed either with a gun or a pistol.He shot one man dead and attempted to murder another, and the band looted their property. The sentences oftwo years, four years and transportation are therefore not severe and call for no review.The appeal fails and is dismissed.Appeal dismissed.I.L.R. 45 Cal. 94,107."

No doubt the object of section 233 is to save the accused from beingembarrassed in his defence if distinct oﬀences are lumped together in one charge or in separate charges and aretried together but the Legislature has engrafted certain exceptions upon this rule contained in sections 234, 2 35 ,236 and 239.Section 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that if in one series of acts so connected together as toform the same transaction, m ore oﬀences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with,and tried at one trial for every such oﬀence.The prosecution story showed that the oﬀence of extortion committed on a particular day was one of a series ofacts connected with the oﬀence of murder and attempt to murder committed on their previous day in such a wayas to form one transaction.The incidents related in the evidence left no doubt that from the moment the accused (a Reserve Inspector ofPolice) started from the Police State, he committed a series of acts involving killing, injuring people, unlawfullyconﬁ ning others and extorting money from one of them and therefore the series of acts attributed to himconstituted one transaction in the course of which two oﬀences which were alleged to be distinct were committed.Held, t hat under the circumstances the case fell within the purview of section 235 of the Code of CriminalProcedure and such joinder was permitted by the exception enacted in that section.Where the two Judges of the High Court on appeal are divided in their opinion as to the guilt of the accused andthe third Judge to whom reference is made agrees with one of them who is upholding the conviction and sentence,it is desirable as a matter of convention though not as a matter of strict law that ordinarily the extreme penaltyshould not be imposed.","Criminal Appeal No . 82 of 1953.Appeal under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated the 16th August,1953, of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in Criminal Appeal No . 1557/6 of 1950, a rising out of thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/5.html/959539589595915 9/12/ 2020AFT AB AHMAD KHAN V.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the two agreeing Judges.The occurrence which led to the prosecution of the appellant took place on September 13 ,1 948 , w hich was thebeginning of the ﬁ rst day of Police action in Hyderabad. The appellant, w ho was Reserve Inspector of Policestationed at Mahbubabad at the material time, a ccording to the prosecution story, v isited two villages Rajole andKorivi accompanied by a number of Razakars and the Police. He arrested Janaki Ramiah (P. W. 5) and NerellaRamulu (P. W. 9) at Rajole and took them to Korivi. Outside this village in the waste land he spotted four men goingto their ﬁ elds and shot at them with his gun. The deceased Mura Muthiah and Somanaboyanna Muthandu (P. W. 2)were injured in the knee, w hile the other two Kotta Ramiah (P. W. 3) and Kancham Latchiah (P. W. 4) wereuninjured. The latter two hid themselves behind the babul trees. P. W. 2 also ran away and hid himself in the bajraﬁ elds a few yards away but the deceased remained where he fell. The appellant searched for the three personswho had run away. He caught P. W. 3 and P. W. 4 and brought them to the spot where the deceased was lying but hecould not trace P. W. 2. The appellant seeing that Mora Muthiah was not dead , s hot him in the chest and killed him.The whole party 591 consisting of P. W. 3, P . W. 4, P . W. 5 and P. W. 9 then went to Korivi village . The appellant stayedat the house of one Maikaldari in the village and spent the night there.Maikaldari and one Berda Agiah (P. W. 8) both asked the appellant why he had arrested P. W. 3 and P. W. 4, for theywere not Congress men. Upon this the appellant released them. The prosecution story proceeds that the father(P. W.1) of the deceased saw the appellant in the night of the 13th September and asked him why he had killed his son.The appellant without saying more advised him to cremate the dead body. P. W. I borrowed wood from the peopleand cremated the body. Four months later the appellant went and ,s tayed at the Government bungalow Korivi, -sent for P. W. I and oﬀered him Rs. 200/- as hush- money for not disclosing the oﬀence. The oﬀer was refused. P. W. 3and P. W. 4 who had been released told the father of P. W. 2 next morning that his son was lying injured in the bajraﬁ eld. He went and had P. W. 2 removed to the hospital where his injuries were attended to. On the same morningthe appellant, w ho had detained P. W. 5 and P. W. 9 in custody, a sked them to pay Rs. when they would be released. P. W. 5 went with a constable to the house of P. W. 6 and P.

He stated that he was posted at Mahbubabad in order to stopthe subversive activities of the communists and that the witnesses being communists had falsely implicated him.He produced witnesses in defence.The First Information Report was lodged on April 14,1 949.This delay was due to the disturbed conditions prevailing at the time and does not aﬀect the truth of the story.appellant was prosecuted and the charge sheet submitted against him on October 30, 1 949.

THE ST A TE OF HYDERABAD [14] INSC 59; AIR 14 SC 46; 15 SCR 58 (6 May 14)It has been argued by Mr. Peerbhoy, le arned counsel on behalf of the appellant, t hat his client had no fair trial andhas detailed a number of circumstances as supporting his contention. We think it unnecessary to deal with eachand every one of these circumstances as in our opinion they do not aﬀect the substance of the matter and are tootriﬂ ing to justify the conclusion that the appellant suﬀered any prejudice or that any miscarriage of justice hadresulted.We shall conﬁ ne ourselves only to a few of them which need examination. It was complained that the appellantwas not furnished with copies of the statements of prosecution Witnesses recorded by the Police and thishampered the appellant in cross- examining the witnesses with reference to their previous statements. It appearsthat the appellant ﬁ led an application through counsel on August 28, 1950, a sking for copies of such statementsunder section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The corresponding section of the Hyderabad Penal Code is166 which is not the same as section 162. While under section 162 it is the duty of the Court to direct a copy of thestatement of a witness recorded by the Police in the course of investigation to be furnished to the accused with aview to enable him to cross- examine such a witness with reference to his previous statement, no such duty isimposed by section 166 and the matter is left entirely to the discretion of the Court.This application was made for re- cross- examination of witnesses which obviously refers to the last stage of theprosecution evidence. The order passed on the application as translated is unintelligible and does not convey thereal intention of the Court. The original which was shown to us, ho wever, leaves no doubt whatever that the Courtordered that the case diaries and the statements were in Court and the appellant's counsel could look into themwith a view to help him in the re- cross- examination of the witnesses but if the Court later felt the necessity offurnishing copies, t he matter would be considered. No complaint was made before the Special Judge about anyprejudice having been caused to the 593 appellant by this order, no r was this point taken before the High Court.Had the appellant any legitimate ground for grievance on this score, he would no doubt have raised it before theHigh Court. We think, t herefore, t hat there is no substance in this point.It was also contended that the prosecution should have produced the duty register of the appellant who was- aGovernment servant in order to put the matter beyond doubt whether,t he accused had left the Headquarters onthe crucial date. We do -lot think that it was any part of the duty of the prosecution to produce such evidence,particularly in view of the fact that direct evidence of the oﬀence was produced in the case. It appears, however,that the appellant himself summoned the Sub-Inspector of Police with the attendance register for 1358 Fasli,corresponding to October, 1948. The Deputy Superintendent of Police in his letter had stated that the entries forOctober were made in the register for 1357 Fasli and that register was destroyed during the Police action. Theappellant's counsel inspected the register and on noticing that the entry for October did not ﬁ nd a place thereinand had been made in the previous register for 1357 Fasli, w hich was destroyed during the Police action, hewithdrew the witness. The appellant satisﬁ ed himself from the inspection of this register that the desired entrieswere not to be found. Since the register containing the material entries was destroyed, it was impossible for theprosecution to discharge the alleged burden of proving the entries in the duty register on the material date.It was also faintly contended that there was no evidence to show that Mura Muthiah had actually died . The fatherof the deceased gave evidence that the dead body of his son was cremated by him and in this he was supported byother witnesses. There is no force in this point.Upon the whole we are satisﬁ ed that the appellant has not been able to substantiate his contention that he did nothave a fair trial.The next contention advanced by the appellant's learned counsel is that there was a misjoinder of 76 594 charges, that though the charges of murder and attempt to murder could be joined and tried together, t he charges ofextortion and wrongful conﬁ nement were distinct oﬀences for which the appellant should have been charged andtried separately as required by the mandatory provisions of section 233 of the Code. The ﬁ rst two oﬀences tookplace on September 13, 1948, in t he night, while the act of extortion took place next morning on the 14th and thelatter charge had nothing whatever to do with the oﬀences committed on the previous night. Learned counselcontends that where, as here, t here is disobedience to an express provision as to the mode of trial contained insection 233, t he trial is wholly vitiated and the accused is not bound to show that the misjoinder has caused anyprejudice to him.The contention is based on the case of Subramania Ayyar v.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/5.html/959539589595935.- 9/12/ 2020AFT AB AHMAD KHAN V. THE ST A TE OF HYDERABAD [14] INSC 59; AIR 14 SC 46; 15 SCR 58 (6 May 14)King- Emperor(1) showing that the misjoinder of distinct oﬀences being prohibited by the express provision of theCode renders the trial illegal and does not amount to a mere irregularity curable by section 537. This was a case inwhich the accused was charged with 41 acts extending over a period of two years which was plainly against theprovisions of section 234 which permitted trial only for three oﬀences of the same kind if committed within aperiod of twelve months. The decision of Lord Halsbury, L ord Chancellor, in this case was distinguished in the caseof Abdul Rahman v.The King- Emperor (1) by the Privy Council. That was a case of conviction on a charge of abetment of forgery inwhich the depositions of some witnesses were not read over to the witnesses but were handed over to them toread themselves.It was held that though the course pursued was in violation of the provisions of section 360, it was a mereirregularity within section 537 and that as no failure of justice had been occasioned, t he trial was not vitiated. Boththe above cases were referred to by the Privy Council in Babulal Chaukani v. King- Emperor(1). The question in thatcase arose as to the true eﬀect of section 239(d), which provides that persons who are (1) 28 I. A. 257.(2) 541. A. 96, (3) A.I. R. 1938 P. C. 130, 5 95 accused of diﬀerent oﬀences committed in the course of the sametransaction may be charged and tried together. The question was whether the correctness of the joinder whichdepends on the sameness of the transaction is to be determined by looking at the accusation or by looking at theresult of the trial. It was held that the relevant point of time is the time of accusation and not that of the eventualresult. The charges in this case were conspiracy to steal electricity and theft of electricity both under the ElectricityAct and under the Penal Code. The Privy Council referred to the fact that the parties had treated an infringementof section 239(d) as an illegality vitiating the trial under the rule stated in Subramania Ayyar v. King Emperor(1) ascontrasted with the result of irregularity as held in Abdul Rahman v. The King,, E mperor (2) . The Privy Councilmerely assumed it to be so without thinking it necessary to discuss the precise scope of the decision inSubramania's case, b ecause in their view the question did not arise. Again in Pulukuri Kottaya and Others v.Emperor (3) the Privy Council treated a breach of the provisions of section 162 of the Code as a mere irregularitycurable under section 537 and as no prejudice was caused in the particular circumstances of that case, t he trial washeld valid.Reference was made to Subramania Ayyar v. King- Emperor(1) as one dealing with the mode of trial in which noquestion of curing any irregularity arises but if there is some error or irregularity in the conduct of the trial, e venthough it may amount to a breach of one or more of the provisions of the Code, it was a mere irregularity and insupport of this reference was made to Abdul Rahman v. The King- Emperor(1).Several decisions of the High Courts were referred to in course of the arguments with a view to showing what isthe true state of the law in view of the Privy Council decisions referred to above but we do not think that thatquestion arises in the present case. We are of opinion that the present is not a case under section 233 of the Codeand it is, t herefore, unne cessary to consider whether the violation of its provisions amounts to an illegality vitiatingthe trial altogether (1) 28 I. A. 257.(2) 54 I. A. 96.(3) A.I. R. 1947 P. C. 67.596 or it is a mere irregularity which can be condoned under section 537. Section 233 embodies the general law asto the joinder of charges and lays down a rule that for every distinct oﬀence there should be a separate charge andevery: such charge should be tried separately. There is no doubt that the object of section 233 is to save theaccused from being embarrassed in his defence if distinct oﬀences are lumped together in one charge or inseparate charges and are tried together but the Legislature has engrafted certain exceptions upon this rulecontained in sections 234, 2 35, 2 36 and 239. Having regard to the facts and the circumstances of this case, w e areof opinion that the present case falls under section 235. It provides that if in one series of acts so connectedtogether as to form the same transaction, m ore oﬀences than one are committed by the same person, he may becharged with, a nd tried at one trial for, every such oﬀence. The prosecution story as disclosed in the evidenceclearly shows that the oﬀence of extortion committed on the 14th September was one of a series of actsconnected with the oﬀence of murder and attempt to murder committed on the previous day in such a way as toform the same transaction. The prosecution case was that when the appellant accompanied by his party came, hecaught hold of two persons (P. W. 5 and P. W. 9) at Rajole and proceeded to Korivi. He took them into custodywithout any rhyme or reason. Then outside the village seeing the deceased, P. W. 2, P . W. 3 and P. W. 4 he shot atwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/14/5.html/959539589595945. 9/12/ 2020AFT AB AHMAD KHAN V. THE ST A TE OF HYDERABAD [14] INSC 59; AIR 14 SC 46; 15 SCR 58 (6 May 14)them. The deceased fell down while the others ran away. He pursued them and brought two of them back to thespot where the deceased was lying but was yet alive. He shot him in the chest and killed him. Then he proceededto the village itself where he stayed for the night. He released P. W. 3 and P. W. 4 on the intercession of certainpersons but kept P. W. 5 and P. W. 9 in wrongful conﬁ nement and released them only next morning after extortingRs. 200 from P. W. 5.These incidents related in the evidence leave no manner of doubt that from the moment the appellant startedfrom the Police Station, he committed a series of acts involving killing, inj uring people, unla wfully conﬁ ning othersand 597 extorting money from one of them. We are satisﬁ ed that the series of acts attributed to the appellantconstitute one transaction in which the two oﬀences which are alleged to be distinct were committed. The casefalls squarely within the purview of section 235 of the Code and we are, t herefore, o f opinion that such misjoinderwas permitted by the exception. No question of contravention of any express provision of the Code such as section233 arises and in the circumstances it is not necessary for us to consider how far the violation of any expressprovisions of the Code relating to the mode of a trial or otherwise constitutes an illegality which vitiates the trial asdistinguished. from an irregularity which is curable under section 537. This conclusion in our opinion disposes ofthe contention about misjoinder of the charges. The fact that the oﬀence of extortion was committed at adiﬀerent place and at a diﬀerent time does not any the less make the act as one committed in the course of thesame transaction.Turning to the merits of the matter, w e are not satisﬁ ed that any prejudice was caused to the appellant in fact. It isnot possible to say that the Court being inﬂ uenced by the evidence on the question of extortion was easily led intothe error of believing the evidence on the question of murder. The witnesses on the point of extortion are P. W. 5and P. W. 9. These are the two persons who were taken away from village Rajole and were wrongfully conﬁ ned,P. W. 5 being released on payment of Rs. 200 and the other let oﬀ without payment. These two witnesses are alsowitnesses to the fact of murder, in addition to the other three witnesses, P . W. 2, P . W. 3 and P. W. 4. P. W. 5 wasinjured by the gun- shot but survived. The other two were scared on hearing the gun- shot and ran away takingprotection under the babul tree. It is not possible to contend that the Sessions Judge having believed the evidenceof extortion from P. W. 5 must have been persuaded into believing that the story of murder deposed to by himmust be correct, f or there is not only the evidence of P. W. 5, b ut three other inde- pendent witnesses.Lastly it was contended that the judgment of one of the agreeing Judges Manohar Pershad J. is purely 598mechanical and does not show that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case. No such complaint is madeabout the judgment of the other agreeing Judge Srinivasachari J . It is true that the learned Judge has madecopious quotations verbatim from the evidence of the witnesses and his comment upon the evidence is not as fulland detailed as might be expected but this practice of writing judgments in this way seems fairly general inHyderabad though we cannot help saying that it is not to be commended. It is the obvious duty of the Court togive a summary of the evidence of material witnesses and to appraise the evidence with a view to arriving at theconclusion whether the testimony of the witness should- be believed. We do not think, ho wever, t hat the criticismthat the judgment is mechanical and does not show a proper appreciation of the evidence is well-founded.The prosecution evidence was believed by the trial Judge and the defence evidence to the eﬀect that the deceasedwas killed by the Military and that the appellant was not present at the time of the occurrence was disbelieved.This ﬁ nding was accepted by both the learned agreeing - Judges.This Court cannot interfere with the ﬁ nding arrived at, on an appreciation of the evidence.there is no good ground for disturbing the conviction of the appellant. We are satisﬁ ed thatThe only question which remains for consideration is whether the sentence of death is the appropriate sentence inthe present case. No doubt there are no special circumstances which justify the imposition of any other but thenormal sentence for the oﬀence of murder. We think, ho wever, t hat where the two Judges of the High Court onappeal are divided in their opinion as to the guilt of the accused and the third Judge to whom reference is madeagrees with one of them who is upholding the conviction and sentence, it seems to us desirable as a matter ofconvention though ,no t as a matter of strict law that ordinarily the extreme penalty should not be imposed. Weaccordingly, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant, r educe his sentence to one of transportation forlife. In other respects the appeal stands dismissed. All the sentences will run concurrently."

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GOVINDA MENON, J.-This application under Art. 32 ofthe Constitution raises the question of the constitutionality of s. 178-A, inserted in the Sea Customs Act, (VIII of1878), by s. 14 of the Amending Act XXI of 1955, and the chief ground on which it is sought to be struck down isthat it oﬀends Art. 14 of the Constitution. From the aﬃdavits of both the parties to which there are annexures thefollowing facts emerge:The petitioner carries on business as a broker in diamonds and precious stones in Calcutta and, according to him,he enjoys credit and reputation in the market as a well-known and respectable broker of such goods. On May 4,1955, the Rummaging Inspector (Intelligence), Customs House, Calcutta, Respondent No. 3, armed with a searchg/in/cs/cn/IC/14/60./TEHTHOLLECTOUSTOMSCUTT95NSa95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS95html16 9/12/ 2020BABULAL A MHALAL MA V. TE CR OF C, CALA [14] IC 60 (8 My 14)warrant from the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta, Respondent No. 4, searched the residential room of thepetitioner, situated at No. 32, Sir Hariram Goenka Street, Calcutta, and after a minute search of the steel almirahin which according to the statement of the petitioner, he used to keep his stock in trade and ﬁnding none therequestioned him as to where he had secreted the diamonds to which the 1112 reply given by him was in thenegative. Thereupon a wall almirah, wherein washed clothes, and other articles were stored, was searched andtherein in an old jacket 475 pieces of diamonds were discovered along with one piece of synthetic stone. Astatement signed by him was taken from which we ﬁnd that his explanation for the possession was that Rs.10,000/- worth of diamonds were received by him from M/s. Ratilal Amritlal, of 89 Zaveri Bazar, Bombay, and therest were purchased locally in Calcutta. He did not remember the names and address of the parties from whom thelocal purchases were made, nor did he have in his possession any documents covering the purchase. Thereafterthe Rummaging Inspector escorted the petitioner to the Customs House where the Assistant Collector, Customs,asked him to produce evidence showing that the goods were not smuggled goods but were legally imported onpayment of duty. The Assistant Collector then permitted the petitioner to go and gave him time till May 7, 1955, toproduce evidence showing that the goods were imported on payment of customs duty and under a valid importlicence. On the same day, i.e., May 4, 1955, a notice was served on the petitioner by the Customs authoritiesstating that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the goods seized by the Rummaging Inspector hadbeen illegally imported into India and, therefore, before further action was taken under as. 167(8) and 167(39) ofthe Sea Customs Act, the petitioner should submit by May 7, 1955, any documents which might be in hispossession showing that the goods in question were legally imported into India on payment of proper Customsduty and on production of a valid import trade control licence. It is also stated that if the goods were not importedby the petitioner, but were bought from another party he should submit by the same date any evidence in hispossession showing the purchase of the goods. In answer to this, on behalf of the petitioner' Messrs. S. K. Sawdayand Company, a ﬁrm of Advocates, Calcutta, wrote to the Assistant Collector, Customs, on May 7, 1955, recitingthe circumstances under which the petitioner came to 1113 be in possession of the seized articles alleging that inthe circumstances the presumption of an oﬀence having been committed in contravention of s. 86 of the SeaCustoms Act attracting a punishment under s. 167(39) of the Sea Customs Act was unwarranted and requested tobe furnished with a statement of the reasons for the seizure as soon as possible. The letter went on to request forten days' time for procuring and producing certiﬁcates etc. from the Bombay trade and Calcutta trade about theauthenticity of the petitioner's business. and also how he came to be in possession of the goods. Another letterwas written by the same ﬁrm of Advocates on May 9, 1955, the details of which it is unnecessary to refer. On May16, 1955, a further letter was written enclosing two certiﬁcates and containing further particulars. This alsoreiterated the request for the supply of speciﬁc reasons for the seizure. On May 23, 1955, the Assistant Collectorreplied to the Advocates informing them that the diamonds in question were seized on reasonable suspicions thatthe same had been imported into India illegally and as such were liable to seizure under the Sea Customs Act.Further correspondence followed by a letter dated June 20, 1955, to which there was a reply on June 25, 1955,wherein there was a detailed reference to everything that had taken place till then and especially with regard tothe earlier denial of the petitioner about there being any diamonds with him and the discovery of the same lateron in a used jacket in a wall almirah. This is a comprehensive letter containing the justiﬁcation for the proceedingstaken by the search oﬃcers and ﬁnally the Assistant Collector observed that if the petitioner failed to submit awritten explanation in time or did not appear before him when the case was ﬁxed for hearing, the case would haveto be decided on the basis of the evidence on the record without any further notice; On July 1, 1955, Messrs.S. K. Sawday & Company wrote a further letter on behalf of the petitioner reiterating their objections and showingwhy action should not be taken. This was followed by letters dated July 4 and 20, 1955. A personal hearing wasgranted on July 21, 1955, followed by a letter from the Advocates 143 1114 dated July 22, 1955. It is unnecessary forthe present to elaborate the contents of these letters or to refer to the statement enclosed therewith from M/s.Ratilal Amritlal, Bombay.The Collector of Customs thereupon, after considering the entire matter placed before him, passed an order datedSeptember 12, 1955, which was dispatched on November 5, 1955, containing an elaborate discussion of thevarious facts and circumstances and ﬁnally concluding that since the petitioner had failed to discharge the onusunder s.178-A of the Sea Customs Act in respect of the diamonds seized on May 4, 1955, orders had been passedconﬁscating the same under ss. 167 (8) and 167 (39) of the Sea Customs Act and that the conﬁscation would beabsolute in terms of the provisions of ss. 3 (2) and 4 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947. The reasonsgiven in the above order were that the subsequent statements were contrary to what had been stated in the ﬁrstinstance, that at the time of the raid, an attempt was made to hide the diamonds in a suspicious manner and lastlyg/in/cs/cn/IC/14/60./TEHTHOLLECTOUSTOMSCUTT95NSa95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS95html26 9/12/ 2020BABULAL A MHALAL MA V. TE CR OF C, CALA [14] IC 60 (8 My 14)that the petitioner was making statements which were in the nature of an afterthought, and not supported byfacts. On account of these and other reasons the Collector was of the opinion that the presumption under s. 178-Ahad not been rebutted. The order stated that an appeal against it lay to the Central Board of Revenue within threemonths of the date of the dispatch and also contained information as to the court-fee stamps etc., which wouldhave to be aﬃxed. Without availing himself of that remedy the petitioner has come up to this Court by way of anapplication for a writ under Art. 32 of the Constitution.Though Mr. Chatterjee faintly argued that the provisions of Art. 19(1)(f) and (g) and Art. 31 of the Constitution hadbeen violated, he did not seriously press those contentions.The main point of the attack was centered on the contention that s. 178-A was violative of the principles of equalprotection of the laws guaranteed under Art. 14 of the Constitution.Before we discuss the validity of s. 178-A, it would be useful to consider the circumstances which led to 1115 theenactment of that statutory provision and for that purpose a brief outline of the relevant sections of the Act wouldbe necessary.Section 19 of the Sea Customs Act, 1878, enables the Central Government by notiﬁcation in the oﬃcial Gazette toprohibit or restrict importation or exportation of goods into or out of India, and s. 20 enumerates the dutiablegoods. When any person imports goods into India, the owner of such goods is required, after the delivery of themanifest by the master of the vessel in which they are imported, to make an entry of the goods for homeconsumption or warehousing by delivering to the Customs-collector a bill of entry containing particulars whichshall correspond with the particulars given of the same goods in the manifest of the ship (s. 86). This is intended togive an idea to the Customs collector as to whether what the owner claims is diﬀerent or the same as what themaster of the vessel has intimated by the delivery of the manifest. On the delivery of such a bill, if any duty ispayable on such goods, the same shall be assessed and it is only after payment of the duty so assessed that theowner may proceed to clear the same (s. 87). Clearance of the goods after the payment of such duty is provided ins. 89 and if everything has been done according to law, the owner can take away the goods.Chapter XVI deals with oﬀences and penalties and s. 167 of the same Chapter contains three columns in aschedule, the ﬁrst of which mentions the oﬀence, the ,second, which does not have the force of law, gives thesection of the Act to which the oﬀence has reference and the third lays down the penalty which may be imposed.With regard to the third column a distinction has to be made between the penalty to be imposed by the customsauthorities and the. punishment that can be imposed by a court of law for the infringement of certain provisions.Oﬀences mentioned in entries Nos.26, 72 and 74 to 76 (both inclusive) have reference to prosecution and conviction before a Magistrate, whereasmost of the others concern penalties imposed by the Customs authorities. This distinction will be important whenreferring to s. 182. We are in this 1116 case concerned with entries Nos. 8 and 39. The penalty of conﬁscation isprovided in the third column of entry No. 8, if any goods, the importation or exportation of which is prohibited orrestricted, are imported contrary to such prohibition or restriction. It lays down that in addition to the conﬁscationof the goods, the persons concerned shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding three times the value of the goods,or not exceeding one thousand rupees.This Court has held that the minimum is the alternative: see Maqbool Hussain v. The State of Bombay(1). EntryNo. 39 also provides for a penalty not exceeding Rs. 500 and the -conﬁscation of the goods if they are taken orpassed out of any custom-house or wharf without an entry duly made.Smuggled goods when traced and seized come under this category. Though the word 'smuggling' is not deﬁned inthe Act, it must be understood as having the ordinary dictionary meaning namely carrying of goods clandestinelyinto a country.Chapter XVII relates to searchers and recovery of smuggled goods, as well as oﬀences, appeals, etc. Section 169gives power to any customs oﬃcer, duly employed in the prevention of smuggling, to search any person on boardof any vessel in any part in (India) or any person who has landed from any vessel, provided that such oﬃcer hasreason to believe that such person has dutiable or prohibited goods secreted about his person. A safeguard isprovided under s. 170 by which any person about to be searched may require the said oﬃcer to take him, previousto search, before the nearest Magistrate or Customs- collector. The important factor in this case is that the personmaking the search or attempting to do it must have a reason to believe that such person has dutiable or prohibitedg/in/cs/cn/IC/14/60./TEHTHOLLECTOUSTOMSCUTT95NSa95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS95html36 9/12/ 2020BABULAL A MHALAL MA V. TE CR OF C, CALA [14] IC 60 (8 My 14)goods. These two sections refer to the time at which a person brings dutiable goods into India but the laterprovisions of the Chapter lay down the procedure to be followed where goods have been smuggled without beingdetected at the port or the wharf. Power to issue search warrants is given to any Magistrate under S. 172 which isto the following eﬀect:(1) [ 1953] INSC 36; [ 1953] S.C.R. 730,742.1117 "" Any Magistrate may, on application by a Customs-collector, stating his belief that dutiable or prohibitedgoods (or any documents relating to such goods) are secreted in any place within the local limits of the jurisdictionof such Magistrate, issue a warrant to search for such goods (or documents).Such warrant shall be executed in the same way, and shall have the same eﬀect, as a search-warrant issued underthe law relating to Criminal Procedure. "" The warrant, as will be noticed, may be issued only on the application of aCustoms-collector who is a responsible senior oﬃcer and that is certainly a safeguard against indiscriminate issueof search warrants.Section 178 speaks of the seizure of goods liable to conﬁscation in any place either upon land or water by anyoﬃcer of customs or any other person duly employed for the prevention of smuggling. The impugned s. 178-Acomes next which is quoted below:"" 178-A (1): Where any goods to which this section applies are seized under this Act in the reasonable belief thatthey are smuggled goods, the burden of proving that they are not smuggled goods shall be on the person fromwhose possession the goods were seized.(2)This section shall apply to gold, gold manufactures, diamonds and other precious stones, cigarettes andcosmetics and any other goods which the Central Government may, by notiﬁcation in the Oﬃcial Gazette, specifyin this behalf. "" The presumption under s. 178-A is equally applicable to seizure as a result of a search warrant unders. 172 or seizure made under s. 178. How the things seized are to be dealt with can be seen from s. 179, and s. 181lays down that when a seizure or arrest is made, a statement in writing of the reasons therefor should be given tothe person who is arrested or from whom goods are seized. When an article is seized under ss. 172 and 178, exceptin cases falling under entries Nos. 26, 72 and 74 to 76 of s. 167, the conﬁscation or penalty or duty may be adjudgedby the oﬃcer mentioned therein, i.e., the person from whom the articles are seized is entitled to an adjudication1118 regarding either conﬁscation or penalty or duty. This gives the valuable right of having the adjudication of theclaim made by a superior oﬃcer, and despite such adjudication if the conﬁscation is still made, under s. 188 anappeal lies from the subordinate to the Chief Customs- authority within three months from the date of such adecision. In the present case the conﬁscation was made by the Collector of Customs and an appeal lay from him tothe Central Board of Revenue.Section 191 enables the Central Government on the application of any person aggrieved by any decision or orderpassed under this Act by an oﬃcer of Customs or Chief Customs-authority and from which no appeal lies, toreverse or modify such decision or order. The outline of the various provisions above made shows that successiveremedies are provided to an aggrieved person from whom articles have been seized and conﬁscated and the Act isa complete Code in itself aﬀording redress and relief in case of illegal or unjustiﬁed orders.The genesis of s. 178-A may now be considered. The Central Government had appointed a commission known asthe Taxation Enquiry Commission which by its report recommended the adoption of the principles underlying s.178-A in order to minimize smuggling. In Vol. II of their report, Chapter VII deals with administrative problems inregard to customs and Excise duties. At pp. 320 and 321 the Committee recommends the amendment of the SeaCustoms Act, ﬁrstly to make smuggling a criminal oﬀence and secondly empowering Customs oﬃcers to searchpremises etc. and the third recommendation is the one with which we are concerned. It is in the following terms:""To transfer the onus of proof in respect of oﬀences relating to smuggling to the person in whose possession anydutiable, restricted or prohibited goods are found."" It is to implement this recommendation that s. 178-A has beenenacted.Section 178-A applies to diamonds and other precious stones and there has been no dispute about 1119 theapplication of this provision to the present case. On the facts mentioned above it is clear that the seizure has beenunder the Act in the reasonable belief of the Customs authorities that they are smuggled goods and, therefore, theburden of proving that they are not smuggled goods has been cast by this section on the persons from whosepossession the goods are seized. No doubt the content and import of the section are very wide. It applies not onlyg/in/cs/cn/IC/14/60./TEHTHOLLECTOUSTOMSCUTT95NSa95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS95html46 9/12/ 2020BABULAL A MHALAL MA V. TE CR OF C, CALA [14] IC 60 (8 My 14)to the actual smuggler from whose possession the goods are seized but also to those who came into possession ofthe goods after having purchased the same after the same has passed through many hands or agencies. Forexample, if the Customs authorities have a reasonable belief that certain goods in the possession of an innocentparty are smuggled goods and the same is seized under the provisions of this Act, then the person from whosepossession the goods were seized, however innocent he may be, has to prove that the goods are not smuggledarticles. This is no doubt a very heavy and onerous duty cast on an innocent possessor who, for aught one knows,may have bona ﬁde paid adequate consideration for the purchase of the articles without knowing that the samehas been smuggled. The only pre-requisite for the application of the section is the subjectivity of the Customs-oﬃcer in having a reasonable belief that the goods are smuggled.A careful examination of the contents of the somewhat lengthy petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution does notshow how the impugned section oﬀends Art. 14, and no distinct and separate ground is taken about itsunconstitutionality, but Mr. Chatterjee argues that the burden of proof enunciated therein is opposed tofundamental principles of natural justice, as it gives an unrestricted arbitrary and naked power to the customsauthorities without laying down any standard or norm to be followed for exercising powers under the section.What is urged is that whereas under the ordinary law the burden of proof in matters like this is on the party whosets up a particular case, under the section that process is inverted and the 1120 burden is cast on the possessor ofthe article to show that it was imported into India with a proper bill of entry and after paying the proper customduty due. As stated already, it is a heavy burden to be laid upon the shoulders of an innocent purchaser who mighthave come into possession after the article has changed many hands and this, it is alleged, invokes discriminationbetween him and other litigants and deprives him of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Art. 14 of theConstitution. A large number of cases have been cited at the Bar in support of the respective contentions of theparties.The true nature, scope and eﬀect of Art. 14 of the Constitution have been explained by diﬀerent constitutionalBenches of this Court in a number of cases, namely, Chiranjit Lal Chowdhury v. The Union of India and Others(1),The State of Bombay and Another v. F. N. Balsara(2), The State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar(3), KathiRaning Rawat v. The State of Saurashtra(4), Lachmandas-Kewalram Ahua and another v. The State of Bombay (5),Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad and Others(6) , Habeeb Mohammad v. The State of Hyderabad(6)and V. M. Syed Mohammed and Company v. The State of Andhra(7), but it will not be necessary for us to enterupon a lengthy discussion of the matter or to refer to passages in those judgments, for the principles underlyingthe provisions of the Article have been summarised by a Full Bench of this Court in Budhan Chaudhury and Othersv. The State of Bihar(9) in the following terms:""It is now well established that while Art. 14 forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classiﬁcation forthe purposes of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of per omissible classiﬁcation two conditions mustbe fulﬁlled, namely (1) that the classiﬁcation must be founded on an intelligible diﬀerential which distinguishespersons or things that (1) [ 1950] INSC 38; [ 1950] S.C.R. 869, (2) [ 1951] INSC 38; [ 1951] S.C.R. 682.(3) [ 1952] INSC 1; [ 1952] S.C.R. 284.(4) [ 1952] INSC 11; [ 1952] S.C.R. 435.(5) [ 1952] INSC 30; [ 1952] S.C.R. 710.(6) [ 1953] S.C.R. 591.(7) [ 1953] INSC 28; [ 1953] S.C.R. 661.(8) [ 1953] INSC 45; [ 1954] S.C.

What is necessary is that there must be a nexus between the basis of classiﬁcation and the object of theAct under consideration.

The principle thus enunciated hasbeen adopted and applied by this Court in Purshottam Govindji Halai v. Shri B. M.Desai (1) and in A. Thangal Kunju Musaliar v. M.Venkitachalam Potti and another (2). Mr. N. C. Chatterjee appearing for the petitioner has referred us to severaldecisions of the Supreme Court of America, such as William N. McFerland v. American Sugar Reﬁning Co. (3), W. D.Manley v. State of Georgia (4) and Tot v. United States(5).It appears to us that these decisions really turn upon the due process clause of the American Federal Constitutionand cannot help in the construction of the equal protection clause of our Constitution. The contentions urged byMr.Chatterjee as to the unconstitutionality of s. 178-A of the Sea, Customs Act, 1878, will, therefore, have to be testedin the light of the principles laid down by this Court in Budhan Chowdhury's case (supra).A cursory perusal of s. 178-A will at once disclose the well deﬁned classiﬁcation of goods based on an intelligiblediﬀerentia. It applies only to certain goods described in sub-s. (2) which are or can be easily smuggled. The, sectionapplies only to those goods of the speciﬁed kind which have been seized under the Act and in the reasonable beliefthat they are (1) [ 1955] 2 S.C.R. 889, 898-899.(2) [ 1955] 2 S-C.R. 1996, 1229.(3) [ 1916] USSC 126; (1916) 241 U.S. 79 ; 6o L.

It is only those goods which answer the threefold description that come under theoperation of the section. The object of the Act is to prevent smuggling.The diﬀerentia on the basis. of which the goods have been classiﬁed and the presumption raised by the sectionobviously have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. The presumption only attachesto goods of the description mentioned in the section and it directly furthers the object of the Act, namely, theprevention of smuggling, and that being the position the impugned section is clearly within the principleenunciated above, not hit by Art. 14. The impugned section cannot be struck down on the inﬁrmity either ofdiscrimination or illegal classiﬁcation. Conﬁning as it does to certain classes of goods seized by the customsauthorities on the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods, there is only a presumption which can berebutted.In these circumstances, there can be no doubt whatever that s. 178-A does not oﬀend Art. 14 of the Constitutionand this petition is, therefore, to be dismissed with costs.Petition dismissed."

Where, for instance, the Riwaj- iam lays down a custom in consonance with thegeneral agricultural custom of the province, very strong proof would be required to displace that presumption; butwhere, on the other hand, the custom as recorded in the Riwaj-i-am is opposed to the custom generally prevalent,the presumption will be considerably weakened, Likewise, 1192 where the Riwaj-i-am aﬀects adversely the rightsof the females who had no opportunity whatever of appearing before the Revenue authorities, the presumptionwill be weaker still and only a few instances would be suﬃcient to rebut it.If the Riwaj-i-am produced is a reliable and a trustworthy document, has been carefully prepared, and does notcontain within its four corners contradictory statements of custom, and in the opinion of the Settlement Oﬃcer isnot a record of the wishes of the persons appearing before him as to what the custom should be, it would be apresumptive piece of evidence in proof of the special custom setup, which if left unrebutted by the daughterswould lead to a result favourable to the collaterals.

L. Gosain (R. S. Narula and Naunit Lal, with him), for the respondent.1955. January 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This is an appeal by the plaintiﬀ in a suit for adeclaration of his title as collateral within' four degrees of Gurdial, who was a Sarswat Brahmin, resident ofPathankot in the district of Gurdaspur and the last male holder of the properties in suit.Gurdial died many years ago leaving certain lands in villages Bhadroya, Kingarian and Pathankot, Tehsil Pathankotin the district of Gurdaspur, and leaving him surviving his widow Musammat Melo and a daughter MusammatMaya Devi, the respondent before us. Some time in the year 1926, a portion of the land in village Bhadroya wasacquired for the Kangra Valley Railway and a sum of Rs. 1,539-7-0 was awarded to Musammat Melo. On ailobjection by the appellant this amount was deposited in the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Gurdaspur,with a direction to pay the interest on this amount to Musammat Melo.On the 28th September 1944 Musammat Melo died and the Revenue Courts ordered mutations in respect of thelands in the three villages in favour of the respondent as the daughter of Gurdial.On the 10th March 1945 the appellant ﬁled the suit out of which this appeal arises against the respondent for adeclaration that he was entitled to the lands mentioned in the plaint as well as to the sum of 1194 Rs. 1 539-7-0 inpreference to the respondent under the custom governing the parties *hereunder the collaterals of the last maleholder excluded the daughter.The respondent contested the suit mainly on the grounds- (i) that the suit for a mere declaration was notmaintainable (ii)that the parties were governed by Hindu Law and not by custom, (iii)that the appellant was not acollateral of Gurdial at all, (iv)that the properties in suit were not ancestral, and (v) that there was no customwhereunder the collaterals of the father who was the last male holder excluded the daughter from succession tothe selfacquired property of her father.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/1.html/959569519959526 9/12/ 2020MAHANT SALIG RAM V. MUSAMMA T MAYA DEVI [15] INSC 1; AIR 15 SC 26; 15 (5) SCR 11 (21 January 15)The Subordinate Judge in his judgment pronounced on the 31st October 1946 held- (i) that the lands in suit beingin possession of tenants, the suit for a declaration of title thereto was maintainable but the suit for a declaration inrespect of the sum of Rs.1,539-7-0 was not maintainable in view of the provisions of the Indian Succession Act relating to successioncertiﬁcates, (ii)that the parties were governed by custom and not by Hindu Law, (iii)that the appellant was acollateral of Gurdial within four degrees, (iv)that the land in Khata No. 2 of village Kingarian was ancestral whilethe rest of the lands in suit were non- ancestral, and (v) that there was a custom according to which daughter wasexcluded from inheritance by the collaterals up to the fourth degree with respect to ancestral as well as self-acquired property of the last male holder as laid down in the case of Buta Singh v. Mt. Harnamon(1).In the result, the Subordinate Judge decreed the suit in respect only of the lands in suit and ordered the parties tobear their own costs.(1) A.I.R. 1946 Lah. 306.1195 Against this judgment and decree the respondent preferred an appeal to the Lahore High Court. Theappellant preferred cross-objections against the order as to costs and against the ﬁnding that the lands in thethree villages except the land in Khata No. 2 of village Kingarian were non-ancestral.After the partition of India the appeal was transferred to the High Court of East Punjab.By its judgment dated the 28th July 1949 the East Punjab High Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the cross-objections on the following ﬁndings:- (i) that the suit for declaration of title to the lands was maintainable as all thelands in suit were in the possession of tenants,, (ii) that the lands in suit except the land in Khata No. 2 of villageKingarian were non-ancestral, and (iii) that according to the custom prevailing in the Gurdaspur district a daughterwas entitled to succeed to non-ancestral property in preference to collaterals even though they were within thefourth degree.The High Court accordingly modiﬁed the decree of the Subordinate Judge to the extent that the declaration in theappellant's favour was made to relate only to the land in Khata No. 2 of village Kingarian which was held to beancestral. On an application made by the appellant on the 26th August 1949 the High Court, by its order dated the5th June 1950, granted him a certiﬁcate of ﬁtness to appeal to the Federal Court. After the commencement of theCon- stitution of India the appeal has come before this Court for ﬁnal disposal.The ﬁrst question raised before us but not very seriously pressed is as to whether the lands in suit other than thosein Khata No. 2 in village Kingarian were ancestral or self- acquired. Our attention has not been drawn to anymaterial on the record which induces us to take a view diﬀerent from the view concurrently taken by the Courtsbelow. We, therefore, see no force or substance in this contention, 153 1196 The main ﬁght before us has been onthe question as to whether there is a custom in the Gurdaspur district governing the parties under which acollateral within the fourth degree excludes the daughter of the last male holder from succession to the self-acquired property of her father.The customary rights of succession of daughters as against the collaterals of the father with reference to ancestraland non-ancestral lands are stated in paragraph 23 of Rattigan's Digest of Customary Law. It is categorically statedin subparagraph (2) of that paragraph that the daughter succeeds to the self-acquired property of the father inpreference to the collaterals even though they are within the fourth degree. Rattigan's work has been accepted bythe Privy Council as ""a book of unquestioned authority in the Punjab"". Indeed,the correctness of this paragraphwas not disputed before this Court in Gopal Singh v. Ujagar Singh(1). The general custom of the Punjab being thata daughter excludes the collaterals from succession to the selfacquired property of her father the initial onus,there- fore, must, on principle, be on the collaterals to show that the general custom in favour of the daughter'ssuccession to the self-acquired property of her father has been varied by a special local custom excluding thedaughter which is binding on the parties. Indeed, it has been so held by the Judicial Committee in Mst. Subhani v.Nawab(2) and the matter is now well-settled.The appellant claims to have discharged this initial onus in two ways, namely (1) by producing the Riwaj-i-am ofthe Gurdaspur district prepared by Mr. Kennaway in 1913 and (2) by adducing evidence showing that the collateralsof one Harnam Singh, who was also a Sarswat Brahmin of the Gurdaspur district and indeed a member of this veryfamily of Gurdial succeeded in preference to his daughter. It is pointed out that no instance has been proved on thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/1.html/959569519959536 9/12/ 2020MAHANT SALIG RAM V. MUSAMMA T MAYA DEVI [15] INSC 1; AIR 15 SC 26; 15 (5) SCR 11 (21 January 15)part of the respondent showing that the daughter ever excluded the collaterals from succession to the self-acquired property of the father. The trial Court (1) [ 1954] INSC 37; [ 1955] 1 S.C R. 86.(2) I.L.R. [ 1940] Lah. 154.1197 as well as the High Court took the view that the evidence as to the succession to the property of HarnamSingh was of no assistance to the appellant for the reason that the evidence was extremely sketchy, that it did notappear whether the properties left by Harnam Singh were ancestral or self- acquired or whether the properties leftby him were of any substantial value at all as would have made it worth while for the daughter to claim the same inaddition to the properties gifted to her by her father during his lifetime.Further, the fact that the daughter did notcontest the succession of the collaterals to the properties left by Harnam Singh, even if they were self acquired,might well have been the result, as held by the High Court, of some family arrangement. We ﬁnd ourselves inagreement with the Courts below that the instance relied upon by the appellant is wholly insuﬃcient to dischargethe onus that was on him to displace the general custom recorded in paragraph 23(2) of Rattigan's Digest ofCustomary Law.The appellant contends that in any case he has fully discharged the onus that was on him by producing in evidencethe Riwaj-i-am recording the custom of the district of Gurdaspur which was compiled by Mr. Kennaway in 1913.Reference is also made to the earlier Riwaj-i-ams of the Gurdaspur District prepared in 1865 and 1893. Answer toquestion 16 as recorded in the Riwaj-i-am of 1913 shows that subject to certain exceptions, which are not materialfor our purpose, the general rule is that the daughters are excluded by the widow and male kindred of thedeceased., however remote. This answer goes much beyond the answers to the same question as recorded in theRiwaj-i-ams of 1865 and 1893 for those answers limit the exclusion in favour of the male kindred up to certainspeciﬁed degrees. The answer to question 17 of the 1913 Riwai-i-am like those to question 17 of the 1865 and 1893Riwaj-i-ams clearly indicates that except amongst the Gujjars of the Shakargarh tehsil all the remaining tribesconsulted by the Revenue authorities recognised no distinction as to the rights of the daughters to inherit (i) theimmovable or 1198 ancestral and (ii) the movable or self acquired property of their respective fathers. It is claimedthat these answers quite adequately displace the general custom and shift the onus to the respondent to disprovethe presumption arising on these Riwaj-i-ams by citing instances of succession contrary to these answers. Insupport of this contention reference is made to the observations of the Privy Council in Beg v. Allah Ditta(1) thatthe statements contained in a Riwaj-i-am form a strong piece of evidence in support of the custom therein enteredsubject to rebuttal. Reliance is also placed on the observations of the Privy Council in Mt.Vaishno Ditti v. Mt. Rameshri(2) to the eﬀect that the statements in the Riwaj-i-am might be accepted even ifunsupported by instances. The contention is that on production by the appellant of the Riwaj-i-am of theGurdaspur district the onus shifted to the respondent to prove instances rebutting the statements containedtherein.This, it is urged, the respondent has failed to do."" There is no doubt or dispute as to the value of the entries in the Riwaj-i-am. It is well_settled that though they areentitled to an initial presumption in favour of their correctness irrespective of the question whether or not thecustom, as recorded, is in accord with the general custom, the quantum of evidence necessary to rebut thatpresumption will, however, vary with the facts and.circumstances of each case. Where, for instance, the Riwaj-i-am lays down a custom in consonance with thegeneral agricultural custom of the province, very strong proof would be required to displace that presumption; butwhere, on the other hand, the custom as recorded in the Riwaj-i-am is opposed to the custom generally prevalent,the presumption will be considerably weakened. Likewise, where the Riwaj-i- am aﬀects adversely the rights of thefemales who had no opportunity whatever of appearing before the Revenue authorities, the presumption will beweaker still and only a few instances would be suﬃcient to rebut it. [ See Khan Beg v. Mt.(1) [ 1916] L.R. 44 I.A. 89.(2) [ 1928] I.L.R. 10 Lah. 186; L.R. 55 I.A. 407 1199 Fateh Khatun (1), Jagat Singh v. Mst.

Subhani's case supra.Learned counsel appearing for the appellant contends that even if the presumption as to the correctness of theRiwaj-i-am be weak, the respondent has not cited a single instance of a daughter having -excluded the collateralswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/1.html/959569519959546 9/12/ 2020MAHANT SALIG RAM V. MUSAMMA T MAYA DEVI [15] INSC 1; AIR 15 SC 26; 15 (5) SCR 11 (21 January 15)from succession to the selfacquired property of her father and has, therefore, failed to discharge the onus that wasthrown on her as a result of the production by the appellant of the Riwaj-i-am of 1913 and, consequently, theappellant must succeed. This argument overlooks the fact that in order to enable the appellant to displace thegeneral custom recorded in Rattigan's work and to shift the onus to the respondent the appellant must produce aRiwaj-i-am which is a reliable and trustworthy document. It has been held in Qamar-ud-Din v. Mt. Fateh Bano(3)that if the Riwaj-i-am produced is a reliable and a trustworthy document, has been carefully prepared and does notcontain within its four corners contradictory statements of custom and in the opinion of the Settlement Oﬃcer isnot a record of the wishes of the persons appearing before him as to what the custom should be, it would be apresumptive piece of evidence in proof of the special custom ,set up, which if left unrebutted by the daughterswould lead to a result favourable to the collaterals. If, on the other hand, it is not a document of the kind indicatedabove then such a Riwaj-i-am will have no value at all as a presumptive piece of evidence. This principle has beenfollowed by the East Punjab High Court in the later case of Mohammad Khalil v. Mohammad Bakhsh (4).This being the position in law, we have to scrutinise and ascertain whether the Riwaj-i-ams of the Gurdaspurdistrict in so far as they purport to record the local custom as to the right of succession of daughters to the selfacquired properties of their respective father are reliable and trustworthy documents.(1) [ 1931] I.L.R. 13, Lah. 276, 296, 297.

In paragraph 4 of the Preface Mr. Kennaway himself states thatmany of the questions related to matters on which there really existed no custom and the people had merelystated what the custom should be and not what it actually was. In Appendix 'C' are collected 56 instances ofmutuations in which the daughter inherited. In these there are four instances relating to Brahmins. Answer toquestion 16, as recorded in this Riwaj-i-am, has been discredited and shown to be incorrect in at least three cases,namely, Gurdit Singh v.Mt. Malan(1), Kesar Singh v. Achhar Singh(1) and Buta Singh v. Mt. Harnamon(3). The answer to question 16 asrecorded in the 1913 Riwaj-i-am, it was pointed out, went much beyond the answer given to the same question inthe Riwaj-i-ams of 1865 and 1893. The answer to question 17 of the 1913 Riwaj- i-am that no distinction is to bemade between ancestral and self-acquired property has not been accepted as correct in not less than six cases,namely, Bawa Singh v. Mt.Partap(4), Jagat Singh v. Mt. Jiwan(5), Kesar Singh v.Gurnam Singh(1), Najju v. Mt. Aimna Bibi (7) Gurdit Singh v. Mt. Man Kaur(8), and Labh v. Mt. Fateh Bibi(9). Thestatements in a Riwaj-i-am the truth of which is doubted by the compiler himself in the preface and which standcontradicted by the instances collected and set out in Appendix 'C' of the same Riwaj-i-am and which have beendiscredited in judicial proceedings and held to be incorrect cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as a reliable ortrustworthy document and cannot displace the initial presumption of the general custom recorded in Rattigan'sbook so as to shift the onus to the daughter who is the res- pondent.The appellant relies on the cases of Ramzan Shah v. Sohna Shah(""), Nanak Chand v.

The ﬁrst three cases are of no assistance tohim although the second and third relate to Brahmins of Gurdaspur, for the properties in dispute' in those caseswere ancestral and the respondent does not now dispute the appellant's right to succeed to her father's ancestralpropertie's. These cases, therefore, do not throw any light on the present case which is concerned with thequestion of succession to selfacquired property. Further, in the last case, the collaterals were beyond the fourthdegree and it was enough for the Court to say that irrespective of whether the properties in dispute were ancestralor selfacquired the collaterals in that case could not succeed. It is also to be noted that the earlier decisionswerenot cited or considered in that case.In our opinion the appellant has failed to discharge the onus that was initially on him and that being the positionno burden was cast on the respondent which she need have discharged by adducing evidence of particularinstances. In these circumstances, the general custom recorded in Rattigan's book must prevail and the decision ofthe High Court must be upheld. We accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.Applal dismissed."

THE STATE OF PUNJAB [1955] INSC 2; AIR 1955 SC 274; 1955 (1) SCR 1201 (25 January 1955).pdf,"Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code is merely explanatory.It does not create any speciﬁc oﬀence. Under this section several persons must be actuated by a commonintention and when in further- (1) A.I.R. 1936 Lah. 68.1202 ance of that common intention a criminal act is done by them, each of them is liable for that act as if the acthad been done by him alone.There is a clear distinction between the provisions of s. 34 and s. 149 of the Indian Penal Code and the two sectionsare not to be confused. The principal element in s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code is the common intention to commita crime. In furtherance of the common intention several acts may be done by several persons resulting in thecommission of that crime. In such a situation s. 34 provides that each one of them would be liable for that crime inthe same manner as if all the acts resulting in that crime had been done by him alone. There is no question ofcommon intention in s. 149 of the Indian Penal Code. An oﬀence may be committed by a member of an unlawfulassembly and the other members will be liable for that oﬀence although there was no common intention betweenthat person and the other members of the unlawful assembly to commit that oﬀence provided the conditions laiddown in the section are fulﬁlled. Thus if the oﬀence committed by that person is in prosecution of the commonobject of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed inprosecution of the common object, every member of the unlawful assembly would be guilty of that oﬀence,although there may have been no common intention and no participation by the other members in the actualcommission of that oﬀence.There is a diﬀerence between object and intention, for although the object may be common, the intentions of theseveral members of the unlawful assembly may diﬀer and indeed may be similar only in one respect namely thatthey are all -unlawful, while the element of participation in action, which is the leading feature of s. 34, is replacedin s. 149 by membership of the assembly at the time of the committing of the oﬀence.A charge for a substantive oﬀence under section 302, or section 325 of the Indian Penal Code, etc. is for a distinctand separate oﬀence from that under section 302, read with section 149 or section 325, read with section 149, etc.A person charged with an oﬀence read with s. 149 cannot be convicted of the substantive oﬀence without aspeciﬁc charge being framed as required by s. 233 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/2/9595795nuar95www.liiofindia.orasee95.html17 9/12/ 2020NANAK CHAND V.

Inthe present case there was no doubt about the facts and if the allegation against the appellant that he had causedthe injuries to the deceeased with takwa was established by evidence, then there could be no doubt that theoﬀence of murder had been committed, 1203 In the present case there was no question of any error, omission orirregularity, in the charge within the meaning of s. 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because no charge unders. 302 of the Indian Penal Code was in fact framed.There was an illegality in the present case and not an irregularity which was curable by the provisions of ss. 535 and537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Assuming however that there was merely an irregularity which was curable,the irregularity in the circumstances of the case was not curable because the appellant was misled in his defenceby the absence of a charge under s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code.By framing a charge under s. 302, read with s. 149, Indian Penal Code against the appellant, the Court indicatedthat it was not charging the appellant with the oﬀence of murder and to convict him for murder and sentence himunder s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code was to convict him of an oﬀence with which he had not been charged. Indefending himself the appellant was not called upon to meet such a charge and in his defence he may well haveconsidered it unnecessary to concentrate on that part of the prosecution ease.Barendra Kumar Ghosh v.

The appellant was convicted by the High Courtunder section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and the sentence of death passed on him by the Additional SessionsJudge of Jullundur was con- ﬁrmed.On the facts alleged by the prosecution there can be no doubt that Sadhu Ram was killed on the 5th of November,1953, at about 6-45 P.m. at the shop of Vas Dev P.

Numerous injuries were found on the person of Sadhu Ram.According to the doctor, who held the postmortem examination, injuries 1, 3 and 4 were due to a heavy sharpedged weapon and could be caused by a takwa. It was denied by the prosecution that the deceased was assaultedby any other person with a takwa.According to the Medical evidence, injuries 1, 3 and 4 individually, as well as collectively, were enough to cause:death in the ordinary course of nature.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/2/9595795nuar95www.liiofindia.orasee95.html27 9/12/ 2020NANAK CHAND V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJAB [15] INSC 2; AIR 15 SC 24; 15 (1) SCR 120 1 (25 Jay 15)In the Court of Sessions the appellant along with others was charged under section 148 and section 302, read withsection 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The Additional Sessions Judge, however, held, that the charge of rioting wasnot proved. He, accordingly found the appellant and three others guilty under section 302 read with section 34 ofthe Indian Penal Code. He acquitted the other three accussed There was an appeal by three convicted persons tothe High Court and the high court convicted the appellant alone under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code,conﬁrming the sentence of death but altered the conviction of the other accused 'from section 302/34 to section323, Indian Penal Code. it held that the provisions of section 34 of the Indian Penal Code did not apply.1205 On behalf of the appellant questions of law and questions of fact were urged. It will be unnecessary to dealwith the questions of fact if the argument on points of law is accepted.The principal question of law to be considered is as to whether the appellant could legally be convicted for murderand sentenced under section 302, Indian Penal Code when he was not charged with that oﬀence. It was urged thatas the appellant had been acquitted of the charge of rioting and the oﬀence under section 302/149 of the IndianPenal Code, he could not be convicted for the substantive oﬀence of murder under section 302, Indian Penal Code,without a charge having been framed against him under that section.Reliance has been placed on the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure relating to the framing of charges,the observations of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh v.Emperor(1) and certain decisions of the Calcutta High Court to which reference will be made later on. It was urgedthat for every distinct oﬀence of which a person is accused, there shall be a separate charge and every such chargeshall be tried separately except in cases mentioned under sections 234, 235, 236) 237 and 239 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure. Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code creates a speciﬁc oﬀence and it is a separate oﬀencefrom the oﬀence of murder punishable under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The provisions of sections 236,237 and 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not apply to the facts and circumstances of the present case. Oﬀbehalf of the Prosecution, however, it was urged that section 149 did not create any oﬀence at all and therefore noseparate charge was obligatory under section 233 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that in any event theprovisions of sections 236 and 237 of the Code of Criminal Procedure did apply and the appellant could have beenconvicted and sentenced, under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, although no charge for the substantiveoﬀence of murder had been framed against him.(1) [ 1925] I.L.R. 52 Cal, 197, 1206 It is necessary, therefore, to examine the provisions of section 149 of the IndianPenal Code and consider as to whether this section creates a speciﬁc oﬀence. Section 149 of the Indian Penal Codeis to be found in Chapter VIII of that Code which deals with oﬀences against the public tranquillity. Section 149 ofthe Indian Penal Code reads:- ""If an oﬀence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecutionof the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to becommitted in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that oﬀence, is amember of the same assembly, is guilty of that oﬀence"".This section postulates that an oﬀence is committed by a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of thecommon object of that assembly or such as a member of the assembly knew to be likely to be committed inprosecution of that object and declares that in such circumstances every person, who was a member of the sameassembly at the time of the commission of the oﬀence, was guilty of that oﬀence.Under this section a person, who is a member of an unlawful assembly is made guilty of the oﬀence committed byanother member of the same assembly, in the circumstances mentioned in the section, although he had nointention to commit that oﬀence and had done no overt act except his presence in the assembly and sharing thecommon object of that assembly.Without the provisions of this section a member of an unlawful assembly could not have been made liable for theoﬀence committed not by him but by another member of that assembly. Therefore when the accused areacquitted of riot and the charge for being members of an unlawful assembly fails, there can be no conviction ofany one of them for an oﬀence which he had not himself committed. Similarly under section 150 of the IndianPenal Code, a speciﬁc oﬀence is created. Under this section a person need not be a member of an unlawfulassembly and yet he would be guilty of being a member of an unlawful assembly and guilty of an oﬀence whichmay be committed by 1207 a member of the unlawful assembly in the circumstances mentioned in the section.Sections 149 and 150 of the Indian Penal Code are not the only sections in that Code which create a speciﬁcoﬀence. Section 471 of the Indian Penal Code makes it an oﬀence to fraudulently or dishonestly use as genuine anyg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/2/9595795nuar95www.liiofindia.orasee95.html37 9/12/ 2020NANAK CHAND V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJAB [15] INSC 2; AIR 15 SC 24; 15 (1) SCR 120 1 (25 Jay 15)document which a person knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document and it provides that such aperson shall be punished in the same manner as if he had forged such document. Abetment is an oﬀence underthe Indian Penal Code and is a separate crime to the principal oﬀence. The sentence to be inﬂicted may be thesame as for the principal oﬀence. In Chapter XI of the Indian Penal Code oﬀences of false evidence and againstpublic justice are mentioned. Section 193 prescribes the punishment for giving false evidence in any stage of ajudicial proceeding or fabricating false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding.Section 195 creates an oﬀence and the person convicted of this oﬀence is liable in certain circumstances to bepunished in the same manner as a person convicted of the principal oﬀence. Sections 196 and 197 to 200 of theIndian Penal Code also create oﬀences and a person convicted under any one of them would be liable to bepunished in the same manner as if he had given false evidence.It was, however, urged on behalf of the Prosecution that section 149 merely provides for constructive guilt similarto section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 34 reads:""When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of suchpersons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone"".This section is merely explanatory. Several persons must be actuated by a common intention and when infurtherance of that common intention a criminal act is done by them, each of them is liable for that act as if the actbad been done by him alone. This section does not create any speciﬁc oﬀence. As was pointed out by Lord Sumnerin Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. Emperor(1) ""'a criminal act' means that (1) [ 1925] I.L.R. 52 Cal. 197, 1208 unity ofcriminal behaviour which results in something, for which an individual would be punishable, if it were all done byhimself alone, that is, in a criminal oﬀence"". There is a clear distinction between the provisions of sections 34 and149 of the Indian Penal Code and the two sections are not to be confused. The principal element in section 34 ofthe Indian Penal Code is the common intention to commit a crime. In furtherance of the common intention severalacts may be done by several persons resulting in the commission of that crime. In such a situation section 34provides that each one of them would be liable for that crime in the same manner as if all the acts resulting in thatcrime had been done by him alone.' There is no question of common intention in section 149 of the Indian PenalCode. An oﬀence may be committed by a member of an unlawful assembly and the other members will be liablefor that oﬀence although there was no common intention between that person and other members of theunlawful assembly to commit that oﬀence provided the conditions laid down in the section are fulﬁlled. Thus if theoﬀence committed by that person is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such as themembers of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object, every memberof the unlawful assembly would be guilty of that oﬀence, although there may have been no common intention andno participation by the other members in the actual commission of that oﬀence. In Barendra Kumar Ghosh v.Emperor(1) Lord Sumner dealt with the argument that if section 34 of the Indian Penal Code bore the meaningadopted by the Calcutta High Court, then sections 114 and 149 of that Code would be otiose. In the opinion of LordSumner, however, section 149 is certainly not otiose,, for in any case it created a speciﬁc oﬀence. It postulated anassembly of ﬁve or more persons having a common object, as named in section 141 of the Indian Penal Code andthen the commission of an oﬀence by one member of it in prosecution of that object and he referred to Queen v.Sabid Ali and (1) [ 1925] I.L.R. 52 Cal, 197, 1209 Others(1). He pointed out that there was a diﬀerence betweenobject and intention, for although the object may be common, the intentions of the several members of theunlawful assembly may diﬀer and indeed may be similar only in respect that they are all unlawful, while theelement of participation in action, which is the leading feature of section 34, was replaced in section 149 bymembership of the assembly at the time of the committing of the oﬀence. It was argued, however, that theseobservations of Lord Sumner were obiter dicta. Assuming though not conceding that may be so, the observationsof a Judge of such eminence must carry weight particularly if the observations are in keeping with the provisions ofthe Indian Penal Code. It is, however, to be remembered that the observations of Lord Sumner did directly arise onthe argument made before the Privy Council, the Privy Council reviewing as a whole the provisions of sections 34,114 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code.On behalf of the appellant certain decisions of the Calcutta High Court were relied upon in support of thesubmission made, viz. Panchu Das v. Emperor(2), Reazuddi and Others v. King-Emperor(3) and Emperor v. MadanMandal and Others(' ). These decisions support the contention that it will be illegal to convict an accused of thesubstantive oﬀence under a section without a charge being framed if he was acquitted of the oﬀence under thatsection read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code., On the other hand, the prosecution relied upon a decisionof the. Full Bench of the Madras High Court in Theetkumalai Gounder and Others v. King-Emperor(5) and the caseQueen Empress v. Bisheshar and Others(6). The decision of the Madras High Court was given in April, 1924, andg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/2/9595795nuar95www.liiofindia.orasee95.html47 9/12/ 2020NANAK CHAND V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJAB [15] INSC 2; AIR 15 SC 24; 15 (1) SCR 120 1 (25 Jay 15)reliance was placed upon the decision of the Allahabad High Court. The decision of -the Privy Council in BarendraKumar Ghosh's case was in October, 1924. The Madras High Court, therefore, did not have before it the decision ofthe - Privy Council. It is impossible to, say what view might have been expressed (1) [ 1873] 20 W.R. (Cr.) 5.(2) [ 1907]I.L.R. 34 Cal.698.(3) [ 1961] 6 O.W.N 98.(4) [ 1914] I.L.R. 41,Cal. 662.(5) [ 1924] I.L.R. 47 Mad. 746.(6) [ 1887] T.L.R. 9 All.645.1210 by that court if the Privy Council's judgment in the aforesaid case had been available to the court. The view ofthe Calcutta High Court had been noticed and it appears that a decision of the Madras High Court in TaikkottathilKunheen(1) was to the eﬀect that section 149 of the Indian Penal Code is a distinct oﬀence from section 325 of theIndian Penal Code. Because of this it was thought advisable to refer the matter. to a Full Bench. Two questionswere referred to the Full Bench: (1) When a charge omits section 149, Indian Penal Code, and the conviction isbased on the provisions of that section, is that conviction necessarily bad, or does it depend on whether theaccused has or has not been materially rejudiced by the omission? (2) When a charge has been framed undersections 326 and 149, Indian Penal Code, is a conviction under section 326, Indian Penal Code, necessarily bad, ordoes this also depend on whether the accused has or has not been materially prejudiced by the form of thecharge? -The Full Bench agreed with the view expressed by Sir John Edge in the Allahabad case that section 149created no oﬀence, but was, like section 34, merely declaratory of a principle of the common law, and its objectwas to make it clear that an accused who comes within that section cannot put forward as a defence that it wasnot his hand which inﬂicted the grievous hurt. It was observed by Spencer, J. that a person could not be tried andsentenced under section 149 alone, as no punishment is provided by the section. Therefore the omission of section149 from a charge does not create an illegality by reason of section 233 of the Code of Criminal Procedure whichprovides that for every distinct oﬀence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge. They didnot agree, with the general statement in Reazuddi's case(2) that it is, settled law that when a person is charged byimplication under section 149, he cannot be convicted of the substantive oﬀence.A charge for a substantive oﬀence under section 302, or section 325 of the Indian Penal Code, etc. is for a distinctand separate oﬀence from that under section (1) [ 1928 ] 18 L.W. 946.(2) (1901] 6 W.N. 98.1211 302, read with section 149 or section 325, read with section 149, etc. and to that extent the Madras view isincorrect.It was urged by reference to section 40 of the Indian Penal Code that section 149 cannot be regarded as creating an'oﬀence' because it does not itself provide for a punishment. Section 149 creates an oﬀence but the punishmentmust depend on the oﬀence of which the oﬀender is by that section made guilty. Therefore the appropriatepunishment section must be read with it. It was neither desirable nor possible to prescribe one uniformpunishment for all cases which may fall within it. The ﬁnding that all the members of an unlawful assembly areguilty of the oﬀence committed by one of them in the prosecution of the common object at once subjects all themembers to the punishment prescribed for that oﬀence and the relative sentence. Reliance was also placed uponthe decision of the Patna High Court in Ramasray Ahir v. King-Emperor(1) as well as the decision of the AllahabadHigh Court in Sheo Ram and Others v. Emperor(1). In the former case the decision of the Privy Council in BarendraKumar Ghosh's case was not considered and the decision followed the Full Bench of the Madras High Court andthe opinion of Sir John Edge. In the latter case the Allahabad High Court deﬁnitely declined to answer the questionas to whether the accused charged with an oﬀence read with section 149, Indian Penal Code, or with an oﬀenceread with section 34, Indian Penal Code, could be convicted of the substantive oﬀence only.After an examination of the cases referred to on behalf of the appellant and the prosecution we are of the opinionthat the view taken by the Calcutta High Court is the correct view namely, that a person charged with an oﬀenceread with section 149 cannot be convicted of the substantive oﬀence without a speciﬁc charge being framed 'asrequired by section 233 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/2/9595795nuar95www.liiofindia.orasee95.html57 9/12/ 2020NANAK CHAND V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJAB [15] INSC 2; AIR 15 SC 24; 15 (1) SCR 120 1 (25 Jay 15)It was urged that in view of the decision of this Court in Karnail Singh and another v. State of Punjab(1) aconviction under section 302, read with see- (1) [ 1928] I.L.R. 7 Patna 484. (2) A.I.R. 1948 All. 162, (3) 1954 S.C.R.904, 155 1212 tion 149, could be converted into a conviction under section 302/34 which the trial Court did. Therecould be no valid objection, therefore, to converting a conviction under section 302/34 into one under section 302which the High Court did.' This argument is unacceptable. The High Court clearly found that section 34 was notapplicable to the facts of the case and acquitted the other accused under section 302/34, that is to say the otheraccused were wrongly convicted by the trial court in that way but the appellant should have been convicted undersection 302. The High Court could not do what the trial court itself could not do, namely, convict under section 302,as no separate charge had been framed under that section.It was urged by the Prosecution that under the provisions of section 236 and section 237 of the Code of CriminalProcedure a person could be convicted of an oﬀence which he is shown to have committed although he was notcharged with it. Section 237 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is entirely dependent on the provisions of section236 of that Code. The provisions of section 236 can apply only in cases where there is no doubt about the factswhich can be proved but a doubt arises as to which of several oﬀences have been committed on the proved facts inwhich case any number of charges can be framed and tried or alternative charges can be framed. In thesecircumstances if there had been an omission to frame a charge, then under section 237, a conviction could bearrived at on the evidence although no charge had been framed. In the present case there is no doubt about thefacts and if the allegations against the ap- pellant that he bad caused the injuries to the deceased with takwa wasestablished by evidence, then there could be no doubt that the oﬀence of murder bad been committed. There wasno room for the application of section 236 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.It had been argued on behalf of the prosecution that no ﬁnding or sentence pronounced shall be deemed invalidmerely on the ground that no charge was framed. Reliance was placed on the provisions of section 535 of the codeof criminal procedure 1213 Reference was also made to the provisions of section 537 of that Code. Section 535 doespermit. a court of appeal or revision to set aside the ﬁnding or sentence if in its opinion the non-framing of acharge has resulted in a failure of justice. Section 537 also permits a court of appeal or revision to set aside aﬁnding or sentence if any error, omission or irregularity in the charge has, in fact, occasioned a failure of justice.The explanation to the section no doubt directs that the court shall have regard to the fact that the objection couldand should have been raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings. In the present case, however, there is noquestion of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge because no charge under section 302 of the IndianPenal Code was in fact framed.. Section 232 of the Code of Criminal Proce. dure permits an appellate court or acourt of revision, if satisﬁed that any person convicted of an oﬀence was misled in his defence in the absence of acharge or by an error in the charge, to direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in whatever manner itthinks ﬁt. In the present case we are of the opinion that there was an illegality and not an irregularity curable bythe provisions of sections 535 and 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Assuming, however, for a moment thatthere was merely an irregularity which was curable we are satisﬁed that, in the circum- stances of the present case,the irregularity is not curable because the appellant was misled in his defence by the absence of a charge undersection 302 of the Indian Penal Code.By framing a charge under section 302, read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code against the appellant, theCourt indicated that it was not charging the appellant with the oﬀence of murder and to convict him for murderand sentence him under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was to convict him of an oﬀence with which he hadnot been charged. In defending himself the appellant was not called upon to meet such a charge and in his defencehe may well have considered it unnecessary to concentrate on that part of the prosecution ease, Attention hasbeen 1214 drawn to the Medical -evidence. With reference to injury No. I the doctor stated that the wounds - werenot very clean-cut. It is further pointed out that the other incised injuries on the head were bone deep. The bone,however, had not been out. Injuries on the head although inﬂicted by a blunt weapon may sometimes assume thecharacteristics of an incised wound. Reference was made to Glasgow on Medical Jurisprudence, 9th Ed., at page241, where it is stated that under certain circumstances, and in certain situations on the body, wounds producedby a blunt instrument may stimulate the appearance of an incised wound.

But for othernon-Madhya Bharat students the capitation fee should be retained as at present at Rs. 1,300 for nominees and atRs.1,500 for others"".Bona ﬁde resident' for the purpose of this rule was deﬁned as: one who is- (a) a citizen of India whose originaldomicile is in Madhya Bharat,provided he has not acquired a domicile elsewhere, or (b) a citizen of India, whoseoriginal domicile is not in Madhya Bharat but who has acquired a domicile in Madhya Bharat and has resided therefor not less than 5 years at the date, on which he applies for admission, or (c)a person who migrated from Pakistanbefore September 30, 1948 intends to reside in Madhya Bharat permanently, or (d) a person or class of persons orcitizens of an area or territory adjacent to Madhya -Bharat or to India in respect of whom or which a Declaration ofEligibility has been made by the Madhya Bharat Government"".The question for determination was whether the rule infringed the fundamental rights guaranteed by Arts. 14 and15(1) of the Constitution.Held, per VFNKATARAMA AYYAR J. (MUKHERJEA C.J., VIVIAN BosE and SINHA JJ. concurring,JAGANNADHADAS J. dissenting) that the rule did not infringe the fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 15(1)because residence and place of birth are two distinct conceptions with diﬀerent connotations both in law and infact, and when Art. 15(1) prohibits discrimination based on the place of birth, it cannot be read as prohibitingdiscrimination based on residence.156 1216 Domicile of a person means big permanent home and is some- times used in the sense of residence.Held further, that the imposition of capitation fee on some of the students and not on others was notdiscriminatory as being in contravention of Art. 14 of the Constitution, because the classiﬁcation was based on aground which had a reasonable relation to the subject matter of the legislation as the object of the classiﬁcationwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595112 9/12/2D.

A classiﬁcation made on a geographical basis would be eminently just and reasonable when it relates toeducation which is the concern primarily of the State.Per JAGANNADHADAS J.-There is no place for regional domicile in the existing Indian Law. In the circumstancesthe phrase original domicile in Madhya Bharat"" is meant to convey the ""Place of birth (of the applicant) in MadhyaBharat"". It is true that ""domicile of origin"" and ""place of birth"" are two diﬀerent, matters. But that is so only wherethe use of the phrase ""domicile of origin"" conveys a deﬁnite legal meaning. In the present case however, thephrase ""domicile of origin in Madhya Bharat"" conveys no legal meaning, and if any meaning has to be attached toit, then it could only have reference to the,""places of birth"".Therefore, the rule in question has reference to place of birth in Madhya Bharat primarily, and oﬀends Art. 15 ofthe Constitution. Even in the view that the rule has reference to the juristic concept of regional domicile and forthat reason does not fall within the scope of the inhibition of Art. 15, a distinction based on such domicile cannot,in any way, be considered reasonable with reference to Art. 14 of the Constitution.Bitstam Mody v.

There is at Indore a Medical-College known as the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College run by the State of Madhya Bharat. Thepetitioner who is a resident of Delhi was admitted as a student of this College in July. 1952, and is now studying inthe third year class, M.B.B.S. Course. His complaint is that the rules in force in this institution discriminate in thematter of fees bet- ween students who are residents of Madhya Bharat and those who are not, and that the latterhave to pay in addition to the tuition fees and charges payable by all the students a sum of Rs. 1,500 per annum ascapitation fee, and that this is in contravention of articles 14 and 15(1) of the Constitution. The petitioneraccordingly prays that an appropriate writ might be issued prohibiting the respondent from collecting from himcapitation fee for the current year, and directing a refund of Rs. 3,000 collected from him as capitation fee for theﬁrst two years.The respondent contests the petition. In the aﬃdavit ﬁled on its behalf, it is stated that the institution in questionhad its origin in private enterprise, and was under the management of a Committee; that it was the Committeethat had made the rule imposing capitation fee on students who did not belong to Madhya Bharat, that the Statetook over the College subject to the conditions relating to reservation of seats under which it was being run, andthat the requirement of a capitation fee from non-residents did not oﬀend either article 14 or article 15(1) of theCon- stitution.A brief narration of the history of the institution will be useful for a correct appreciation of the contentions oneither side. The beginnings of the institution go back to the year 1878, when a Dr. Beaumont started a MedicalSchool at Indore under the name of 1218 Indore Medical School, as an adjunct to a hospital called the IndoreCharity Dispensary. It received considerable ﬁnancial assistance from the rulers of Gwalior and other Indian States,and became well established; and it. is.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595212 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)claimed on its behalf that the medical practitioners of Central India, Rajasthan and neighbouring States werelargely recruited from its alumni. In 1910 the name of the school was changed to King Edward Memorial School,Indore, and it was thereafter under the management of a Committee.In 1940 the Committee decided to improve the status of the School, and started collecting funds for equipping ,itas a ﬁrst-class Medical College. The arrangements were completed in 1947, and in 1948 the institution wasaﬃliated to the University of Agra. It then came to be known as the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College.In 1950 the College Council resolved to request the Madhya Bharat Government to takeover -the running of theinstitution, subject to the arrangements entered into between the institution and certain States and donors forreservation of seats for their nominees. The proposal was accepted by the respondent, and by resolution dated 17-3- 1951 it took over the administration of the College.According to the rules relating to admission to the College which were in force at that time, the maximum numberof students who could be admitted in any year was 50, and they were classed into two groups, nominees andordinary students. The Committee had arranged to raise funds for the institution on a promise that those whocontributed Rs.7,000 would be entitled to nominate one student each for admission into the College, and that those studentscalled nominees should pay, in addition to the usual fees and charges, a capitation fee of Rs. 1,300 per annum.Excluding the seats which have thus to be reserved for the nominees, the remaining seats were thrown open to alleligible applicants who came to be called selfnominees, and the requisite number was selected from among themon the basis of merit. Then came the rule which is at the root of the present controversy. It provided that ""MadhyaBharat students are 1219 exempted from capitation fees"". (Vide 1952 Calendar, page 5 and Exhibit G). After theState took over the management, it introduced certain modiﬁcations in the rules, and it is with these new rulesthat the present petition is concerned, the petitioner having been admitted under them. In place of the rule that""Madhya Bharat students are exempted from capitation fees"" a Dew rule was substituted, which runs as follows:""For all students who are `bonaﬁde residents' of Madhya Bharat no capitation fee should be charged. But for othernon-Madhya Bharat students the capitation fee should be retained as at present at Rs. 1,300 for nominees and atRs.1,500 for others"". [ Vide Exhibit 6/1 quoted in Rustam Mody v. State: Sumitra Devi v. State(1)].'Bona ﬁde resident' for the purpose of this rule was deﬁned as:""one who is- (a)a citizen of India whose original domicile is in Madhya Bharat, provided be has not acquired adomicile elsewhere, or (b)a citizen of India, whose original domicile is not in Madhya Bharat but who has acquireda domicile in Madhya Bharat and has resided there for not less than 5 years at the date, on which he applies foradmission, or (c)a person who migrated from Pakistan before September 30, 1948 and intends to reside in MadhyaBharat permanently, or (d)a person or class of persons or citizens of an area or territory adjacent to Madhya Bharator to India in respect of whom or which a Declaration of Eligibility has been made by the Madhya BharatGovernment"".In brief, the change eﬀected by the new rule was that whereas previously exemption from capitation fee wasgranted in favour of all Madhya Bharat students whatever that might mean, under the revised rule it was limited tobona ﬁde residents of Madhya Bharat.Now the contention of Mr. N. C. Chatterjee for the (1) I.L.R. 1953 Madhya Bharat 87, 99, 1220 petitioner is that thisrule is in contravention of articles 14 and 15(1), and must therefore be struck down as unconstitutional and void.Article 15(1) enacts:""The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth orany of them"".The argument of the petitioner is that the rule under challenge in so far as it imposes a capitation fee on studentswho do not belong to Madhya Bharat while providing an exemption therefrom to students of Madhya Bharat,makes a discrimination based on the place of birth, and that it oﬀends article 15 (1). Whatever force there mighthave been in this contention if the question had arisen with reference to the rule as it stood when the State tookover the administration, the rule was modiﬁed in 1952, and that is what we are concerned with in this petition. Therule as modiﬁed is clearly not open to attack as infringing article 15(1). The ground for exemption from payment ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595312 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)capitation fee as laid down therein is bona ﬁde residence in the State of Madhya Bharat. Residence and place ofbirth are two distinct conceptions with diﬀerent connotations both in law and in fact, and when article 15(1)prohibits discrimination based on the place of birth, it cannot be read as prohibiting discrimination based onresidence. This is not seriously disputed. The argument that is pressed on us is that though the rule purports togrant. exemption based on residence within the State, the deﬁnition of bonaﬁde residence under the rule showsthat the exemption is really based on the place of birth. Considerable emphasis was laid on clauses (a) and (b) ofthe rule wherein 'residence' is deﬁned in terms of domicile, and it was argued that the original domicile, as it istermed in the rules, could in substance mean only place of birth, and that therefore the exemption based ondomicile was, in eﬀect, an exemption based on place of birth under an alia8. That, however, is not the true legalposition. Domicile of a person means his permanent home. ""Domicile meant permanent home, and if that was notunderstood by itself no illustration could help to make it 1221 intelligible"" observed Lord Cranworth in Whicker v.Hume(1).Domicile of origin of a person means ""the domicile received by him at his birth"". (Vide Dicey on Conﬂict of Laws,6th Edition, page 87). The learned author then proceeds to observe at page 88:""The domicile of origin, though received at birth, need not be either the country in which the infant is born, or thecountry in which his parents are residing, or the country to which his father belongs by race or allegiance, or thecountry of the infant's nationality"".In Somerville v. Somerville(2), Arden, Master of the Rolls, observed:""I speak of the domicile of origin rather than of birth. I ﬁnd no authority which gives for the purpose of successionany eﬀect to the place of birth. If the son of an Englishman is born upon a journey, his domicile will follow that ofhis father"".Mr. N. C. Chatterjee argued that domicile of origin was often called domicile of birth, and invited our attention tocertain observations of Lord Macnaghten in Winans v.Attorney-General(1). But then, the noble Lord went on to add that the use of the words ""domicile of birth"" wasperhaps not accurate. But that apart, what has to be noted is that whether the expression used is ""domicile oforigin"" or ""domicile of birth"", the concept involved in it is something diﬀerent from what the words ""place of birth""signify. And if ""domicile of birth"" and ""place of birth"" cannot be taken as synonymous, then the prohibition enactedin article 15(1) against discrimination based on place of birth cannot apply to a discrimination based on domicile.It was argued that -under the Constitution there -can be only a single citizenship for the whole of India, and that itwould run counter to that notion to hold that the State could make laws based on domicile within their territory,.But citizenship and domicile represent two diﬀerent conceptions. Citizenship has reference to the political statusof a person, and (1) [ 1859] 28 L.J. Ch. 396, 400.(2) [ 1801] EngR 161; [ 1801] 5 Ves. 750 at 786, 787; [ 1801] EngR 161; 31 E.R. 839, 858.(3) 1901 A.C. 287, 290.1222 domicile to his civil rights. A classic statement of the law on this subject is that of Lord Westbury in Udny v.Udny(1). He observes:""The law of England, and of almost all civilised countries, ascribes to each individual at his birth two distinct legalstatuses or conditions: one by virtue of which he becomes the subject of some particular co untry binding him bythe tie of national allegiance, and which may be called his political status, another by virtue of which be hasascribed to him the character of a citizen of some particular country and as such is possessed of certain municipalrights, and subject to certain obligations, which latter character is the civil status or condition of the individual, andmay be quite diﬀerent from his political status. The political status may depend on diﬀerent laws in diﬀerentcountries;whereas the civil status is governed universally by -one single principle, namely, that of domicil, which is thecriterion established by law for the purpose of determining civil status. For it is on this basis that the personalwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595412 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V .

He must, as it was said, 'intend quatenus in illo exuere patriam'. But this doctrine hasnow been pronounced erroneous by the highest authority"".Vide also the observations of Lord Lindley in Winans v.Attorney-General(1). In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. VI the law is thus stated at page 198, para 242:""English law determines all questions in which it admits the operation of a personal law by the test of domicile Forthis purpose it regards the organisa- (1) [ 1869] L.R. I Sc. & Div. 441, 457.(2) [ 1904] UKLawRpAC 21; 1904 A.C. 287, 299.1223 tion of the civilised world in civil societies, each of which consists of all those persons who live in any territorialarea which is subject to one system of law, and not its Organization in political societies or States, ,each of whichmay either be co-extensive with a single legal system or may unite several systems under its own sovereignty"".Under the Constitution, article 5, which deﬁnes citi- zenship, itself proceeds on the basis that it is diﬀerent fromdomicile, because under that article, domicile is not by itself suﬃcient to confer on a person the status of a citizenof this country.A more serious question is that as the law knows only of domicile of a country as a whole and not of any particularplace therein, whether there can be such a thing as Madhya Bharat domicile apart from Indian domicile. To answerthis question we must examine what the word ""domicile"" in law imports. When we speak of a person as having adomicile of a particular country, we mean that in certain matters such as succession minority and marriage he isgoverned by the law of that country. Domicile has reference to the system of law by which a person is governed,and when we speak of the domicile of a country, we assume that the same system of law prevails all over thatcountry. But it might well happen that laws relating to succession and marriage might not be the same all over thecountry, and that diﬀerent areas in the State might have diﬀerent laws in respect of those matters. In that case,each area having a distinct set of laws would itself be regarded as a country for the purpose of domicile. Theposition is thus stated by Dicey at page 83:""The area contemplated throughout the Rules relating to domicile is a 'country' or territory subject to one systemof law'. The reason for this is that the object of this treatise, in so far as it is concerned with domicile, is to showhow far a person's rights are aﬀected by his having his legal home or domicile within a territory governed by onesystem of law, i.e. within a given country, rather than within 157 1224 another. If, indeed, it happened that one partof a country, governed generally by one system of law, was in many respects subject to special rules of law, then itwould be essential to determine whether D was domiciled within such particular part, e.g. California in the UnitedStates;but in this case, such part would be pro tanto a separate country, in the sense in which that term is employed inthese Rules"".The following statement of the law in Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume VI, page 246, para 249 may also bequoted:law, a domicil is acquired in that part of the State where the individual resides"".An instructive decision bearing on this point is Somerville v. Somerville(1). There, the dispute related to thepersonal estate of Lord Somerville, who had died intestate in London, his domicile of origin being Scotch. Thecontest was between those who were entitled to inherit if his domicile was Scotch, and those who were entitled toinherit if his domicile was English. It was urged in support of the claim of the latter that by reason of the death ofLord Somerville at London, succession was governed by English domicile. In discussing this question the learnedMaster of the Rolls referred to the fact that the law of succession in the Province of York was diﬀerent from thatwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595512 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)prevailing in other parts of England, and was akin to Scotch law, and posed the question whether if a Yorkshireman died intestate in London, succession to his personal estate would be governed by the Law of the Province ofYork or of England.He observes:""It is surprising that questions of this sort have not arisen in this country when we consider that till a very lateperiod and even now for some purposes a diﬀerent succession prevails in the Province of York. The custom is veryanalogous to the law of Scotland. Till a very late period the inhabitants of York were restrained from disposing oftheir property by testament................ And the question then would have been (1) [ 1801] EngR 161; [ 1801] 31 E.R.839.1225 whether during the time the custom and the restraint of disposing by testament were in full force, agentleman of the county of York coming to London for the winter and dying there intestate, the disposition of hispersonal estate should be according to the custom or the general law"".The principle that was laid down was that ""succession to the personal estate of an intestate is to be regulated bythe law of the country, in which be was a domiciled inhabitant at the time of his death; without any regardwhatsoever to the place either of the birth or the death or the situation of the property at that time"". On the facts,the decision was that the domicile of origin which was Scotch, governed the succession. What is of interest in thisdecision is that it recognizes that for purposes of succession there can be within one political unit, as manydomiciles as there are systems of law, and that there can be a Scotch domicile, an English domicile and even a Yorkdomicile within Great Britain.Under the Constitution, the power to legislate on succession, marriage and minority has been conferred underEntry 5 in the Concurrent List on both the Union and the State Legislatures, and it is therefore quite conceivablethat until the Centre intervenes and enacts a uniform code for the whole of India, each State might have its ownlaws on those subjects, and thus there could be diﬀerent domiciles for diﬀerent States. We do not, therefore, seeany force in the contention that there cannot be a domicile of Madhya Bharat under the Constitution.It was also urged on behalf of the respondent that the word ""domicile"" in the rule might be construed not in itstechnical legal sense, but in a popular sense as meaning ""residence"", and the following passage in Wharton's LawLexicon, 14th Edition, page 344 was quoted as supporting such a construction:""By the term 'domicile', in its ordinary acceptation, is meant the place where a person lives or has his home. In thissense the place where a person has his actual residence, inhabitancy, or commoraney, is sometimes called hisdomicile"", 1226 In Mcmullen v. Wadsworth(1), it was observed by the Judicial Committee that ""the word `domicil'in article 63 (of the Civil Code of Lower Canada) was used in the sense of residence, and did not refer tointernational domicile"".What has to be considered is whether in the present context ""domicile"" was used in the sense of residence. Therule requiring the payment of a capitation fee and providing for exemption therefrom refers only to bona ﬁderesidents within the State. There is no reference to domicile in the rule itself, but in the Explanation which follows,clauses (a) and (b) refer to domicile, and they occur as part of the deﬁnition of ""bonaﬁde resident"". In Corpus JurisSecundum, Volume 28, page 5, it is stated:""The term `bonaﬁde residence' means the residence with domiciliary intent"".There is therefore considerable force in the contention of the respondent that when the rule-making authoritiesreferred to domicile in clauses (a) and (b) they were thinking really of residence. In this view also, the contentionthat the rule is repugnant to article 15(1) must fail.There was a good deal of argument before us on the validity of clause (d) of the rule. It was contended by thepetitioner that clause introduced a new element unconnected with domicile or residence which formed the basisof the previous clause, that it put foreign nationals on a more advantageous footing than Indian citizens, and thatthe entire rule must be discarded as based on no rational or intelligible principle. No doubt, clause (d) strikes a newnote. And it may be that as a matter of policy the management of the institution decided that it would be anadvantage to associate citizens of other countries with Indian citizens in educational institutions, and thereforereserved a few seats for them on the most-favoured nation treatment basis. The validity of this reservation,however, does not arise for decision in this petition, and as clauses (a) to (c) rest on a classiﬁcation based onwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595612 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)domicile and residence, and are (1) [ 1889] UKLawRpAC 31; [ 1889] 14 A.C. 631, 1227 distinct and severable fromclause (d), they would be valid even if clause (d) were to be held bad.It must be mentioned that the rule relating to the payment of capitation fee discussed above was again modiﬁedby the management as a result of the decision of the High Court of Madhya Bharat in Rustam Mody v. State:Sumitra Devi v.State(1). The rule as amended-and that is what is now in force-runs as follows:""Only those students, who are bona ﬁde residents of Madhya Bharat and have been selected for being admitted inaccordance with the allocation scheme and the rules of admission to the seats speciﬁcally reserved for theresidents of Madhya Bharat are exempted from the payment of Capitation Fees. All other students admitted toseats other than those reserved for the residents of Madhya Bharat shall be liable to pay Capitation Fees asprescribed"".Under this rule also, the exemption is in favour of bona ﬁde residents of Madhya Bharat"", and therefore withreference to the points now under consideration, the position under the present rule would appear to be the sameas under the previous one. It is unnecessary to consider this matter further, as learned counsel on either side wereagreed that the rights of the petitioner must be determined in accordance with the rule which was in force whenhe was admitted.It is next contended for the petitioner that the imposition of capitation fee on some of the students and not onothers is discriminatory, and is in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution, and therefore void. Theimpugned rule divides, as already stated, Self-nominees into two groups, those who are bona ﬁde residents ofMadhya Bharat and those who are not, and while it imposes a capitation fee on the latter, it exempts the formerfrom the payment thereof. It thus proceeds on a classiﬁcation based on residence within the State, and the onlypoint for decision is whether the ground of classiﬁcation has a fair and substantial relation to the purpose of thelaw, or whether it is purely arbitrary and fanciful,, (1) I.L.R. 1953 Madhya Bharat 87, 1228 The object of theclassiﬁcation underlying the impugned rule was clearly to help to some extent students who are residents ofMadhya Bharat in the prosecution of their studies, and it cannot be disputed that it is quite a legitimate andlaudable objective for a State to encourage education within its borders. Education is a State subject, and one ofthe directive principles declared in Part IV of the Constitution is that the State should make eﬀective provisions foreducation within the limits of its economy.(Vide article 41). The State has to contribute for the upkeep and the running of its educational institutions. We arein this petition concerned with a Medical College, and it is well-known that it requires considerable ﬁnance tomaintain such an institution. If the State has to spend money on it, is it unreasonable that it should so order theeducational system that the advantage of it would to some extent at least inure for the beneﬁt of the State? Aconcession given to the residents of the State in the matter of fees is obviously calculated to serve that end, aspresumably some of them might, after passing out of the College, settle down as doctors and serve the needs ofthe locality. The classiﬁcation is thus based on a ground which has a reasonable relation to the subject-matter ofthe legislation, and is in consequence not open to attack. It has been held in The State of Punjab v. Ajaib Singh andanother(1) that a classiﬁcation might validly be made on a geographical basis. Such a classiﬁcation would beeminently just and reasonable, where it relates to education which is the concern primarily of the State. Thecontention, therefore, that the rule imposing capitation fee is in contravention of article 14 must be rejected.We have proceeded so far on the assumption that the impugned rule is a ""law"" as deﬁned in article 13. If it is notthat, article 14 would have no application. It was indeed contended by the learned Attorney General on behalf ofthe respondent that the rule in question is a mere administrative or executive order, and that however liberally theword ""law"" might be (1) [ 1952] INSC 57; [ 1953] S.C.R. 254.1229 construed, it should be limited to what is an expression of the legislative power and cannot comprehend whatis an executive order. In support of this contention he relied on the decision in Om Prakash v. The State(1). In theview which we have taken that even on the footing that it is a law, the rule does not oﬀend article 14, we do notconsider it necessary to express any opinion on this question.One other contention put forward by the respondent remains to be noticed. It was urged that as the institutionwas originally under private management and the State took it over subject to the conditions under which it wasrun, it was bound to enforce the rule relating to the payment of capitation fee which was previously in operation.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595712 9/12/2D.

The history of the (1) A.I.R. 1953 Punjab 93.1230 institution and the relevant rules have been set out in the judgment of the majority just delivered and it isunnecessary to repeat them. It is desirable, however, to mention, at the outset two matters. The exact authorityfor these rules, that is to say, the question whether they are rules made under a rule-making power having alegislative basis, or whether they are merely executive orders, which it is open to the State Government to changeas they please, has not been clearly elucidated. Though the learned Attorney General suggested, in -the course ofhis arguments, that these were merely executive orders and that as such they did not come within the scope ofarticle 14 of the Constitution, the material placed before us throws no light thereon. Nor has the question as towhether these executive orders which are issued by the State and are general in their application within the ambitof their subject matter constitute laws falling with in the scope of article 14, been suﬃciently canvassed before us.The discussion has proceeded on the assumption that the validity of these rules may be judged with referenceboth to the article 14 and article 15, no other article obviously having any direct bearing.Now, as has been pointed out in the majority judgment, the relevant original rule by the date when the Collegewas taken over by the State from private management was that ""Madhya Bharat students are exempted fromcapitation fees"".On the State taking over the College, this rule was substituted by the following, new rule:""For all students who are 'bona ﬁde residents' of Madhya Bharat no capitation fee should be charged. But for othernon-Madhya Bharat students the capitation fee should be retained as at present at Rs. 1,300 for nominees and atRs.1,500 for others"".""Bona ﬁde resident"" for the purposes of the above rule was deﬁned as ""(a) a citizen of India, whose originaldomicile is in Madhya Bharat, provided he has not acquired a domicile elsewhere, or (b) a citizen of India, whoseoriginal domicile is 1231 not in Madhya Bharat but who has acquired a domicile in Madhya Bharat and has residedthere for not less than 5 years, at the date on which he applies for admission, or (c) a person who migrated fromPakistan before A. September 30, 1948 and intends to reside in Madhya Bharat permanently, or (d) a person orclass of persons or citizens of an area or territory adjacent to Madhya Bharat or to India in respect of whom orwhich a Declaration of Eligibility has been made by the Madhya Bharat Government"".This, it is said, was the rule in force when the applicant was admitted into the College. This rule is again said tohave been modiﬁed recently and the same is as follows:""Only those students, who are bona ﬁde residents of Madhya Bharat and have been selected for being admitted inaccordance with the allocation scheme and the rules of admission to the seats speciﬁcally reserved for theresidents of Madhya Bharat are exempted from the payment of capitation fees. All other students admitted toseats other than those reserved for the residents of Madhya Bharat shall be liable to pay capitation fees asprescribed"".In the aﬃdavit ﬁled in this Court by Shri H. L. Gupta, Assistant Secretary to the Government of Madhya Bharat, it isstated that this was meant to be only a restatement by the Government of their real intention in order to clarifywhat the prior rule was meant to convey. Now, with reference to these rules, it is necessary to notice thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595812 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)suggestion made in the course of the argument that the rules by the use of the word ""exemption"" indicate thatsome students get the beneﬁt of not paying what would otherwise have been payable and that therefore otherscannot complain of any hostile action constituting discrimination. But a copy of the rules for admission to theregular M.B.B.S.courses (copied from Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore, Calendar of 1954) with which we havebeen furnished as one of the 1232 enclosures to the aﬃdavit of the petitioner, and which is at pages 34 to 38 of thepaper-book, on a perusal thereof, clearly shows at page 37 that the capitation fee is in addition to the normal feesand that this is payable only in respect of some students, while all the students in general pay certain prescribedfees. But whether the rule is in the nature of an exemption for some students or is by way of an addition for theothers, there is clearly discrimination between the two groups which aﬀects the one adversely. The very use of thephrase ""capitation fees"" for this additional amount levied from some, is indicative of its discriminatory character.The only question accordingly is whether this discrimination falls within the mischief of either article 14 or article15. It is desirable for this purpose to have a clear understanding of what exactly the relevant rule at the date of theadmission of the applicant into the College signiﬁes.It has been stated that this rule has to be understood with reference to the allocation scheme for admission ofstudents which is said to be as follows in the aﬃdavit of Shri H.L. Gupta, Assistant Secretary to the Government of Madhya Bharat.""The basis of allocation of seats at the time of admission each year is that out of the total number of candidates tobe newly admitted a certain number of seats is reserved for 'nominees' of such States as also of such individualswith whom there is a contract of reservation of seats, and a certain number of seats is reserved for Madhya Bharat.The rest go to what are called 'self-nominees'. All candidates (except Central Government nominees) are, however,admitted by a competitive examination and are selected in order of merit for each category"".It has been stated by the applicant in his reply aﬃdavit that, while the competitive examination is the same for all,it is only the marks of the candidates in each separate group that are taken into consideration inter se. Howeverthis may be, there appear to be, as stated by the Assistant Secretary to the Madhya Bharat Government, threebroad categories: (1) A 1233 certain number of seats reserved for ""bona ﬁde students of Madhya Bharat"". (2) Acertain number of seats reserved for some speciﬁed States and the original donors, who in respect of theirnominees have to pay capitation fees, somewhat lower in amount, and (3) The rest of the students who have topay the higher capitation fees. The second category above mentioned may be left out of consideration for thepresent case, since that depends on certain pre- existing contractual obligations and diﬀerent considera- tionsmay arise and the present petitioner does not fall within this category. The question of discrimination in this casearises really with reference to categories I and 3 above and turns upon the exact meaning of the phrase ""bonaﬁde,residents"" as deﬁned in the rules. If this deﬁnition was meant to convey fairly andsubstantially, the qualiﬁcation ofresidence in Madhya Bharat and nothing else, it may be, that this is not hit. by article 15 and that it may also be areasonable classiﬁcation, on the facts and circumstances of a particular State, for purposes -of article 14. Thelearned Attorney-General himself based his arguments, at one stage, on this view of the deﬁnition of ""bona ﬁderesident"" in the rules. But the diﬃculty is that the learned Attorney-General has not committed himself, on behalfof the State, as to this being the only reasonable meaning of the deﬁnition. He put it as a kind of alternative. TheAssistant Secretary to the Madhya Bharat Government, Shri H. L. Gupta, in his aﬃdavit clearly and categoricallysays that the charging of capitation fee, truly speaking, is not on the basis of residence. The restatement of therule by the Government is not also deﬁnite or clear about it inasmuch as it uses again the phrase ""bona ﬁderesidents of Madhya Bharat"". Bona ﬁde residents of Madhya Bharat, as deﬁned, is clearly something quitediﬀerent from the class which can be designated ordi- narily as ""residents of Madhya Bharat"". Now out of the fourcategories comprised in the deﬁnition, obviously (c) and (d) have absolutely nothing to do with actual residence. Itis also diﬃcult to discover any principle with reference to which discrimination can be justiﬁed in favour of (1) aPakistani migrant 1234 with the mere intention to make Madhya Bharat his permanent residence, and (2) aperson, belonging to the contiguous areas of Madhya Bharat, or the contiguous areas of India (and excludingcitizens of India from the non-contiguous areas of Madhya Bharat, like the applicant). The main categories,however, are those which fall within (a) and (b) of the deﬁnition. But it is diﬃcult to say even of these categoriesthat they are based merely on residence, as such., of the person concerned. Category (b) has reference to""Domicile in Madhya Bharat"" plus residence in Madhya Bharat for the preceding ﬁve years. Category (a) hasreference only to ""original domicile in Madhya Bharat"" and by contrast with category (b) which requires precedentresidence, is clearly intended not to insist on any precedent residence. Even if it be assumed that ""domicile"" means""permanent home"" as stated by Lord Cranston in Whicker v. Hume(1) this has no necessary reference to the appli-www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/0209595395219595912 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)cant's actual residence at the relevant time. It is diﬃcult to see why the fact of the applicant's father having had hispermanent home in Madhya Bharat at the time of applicant's birth should be a ground of preference or why aperson who has made Madhya Bharat his permanent home but left it for a time and returned only, say, an yearpreviously should be denied it. Thus the deﬁnition of ""bona ﬁde resident"" taken as a whole or even conﬁning it tocategories (a), (b) and (c) cannot be said to be based merely on residence in Madhya Bharat. Nor can anyintelligible basis of grouping be gathered therefrom by imputing to the word ""domicile"" the meaning ""residence""or (.permanent home"". It is interesting to notice, in this connection, that category (b) in requiring Madhya Bharatdomicile and precedent residence for ﬁve years follows closely the pattern of Indian citizenship based on category(c) of article 5 of the Constitution with ""domicile of Madhya Bharat"" substituted for ""domicile of India"" and thisraises the question of the concept of regional domicile (tending to the growth of the idea of regional citizenship)which will be discussed presently.(1) [ 1859] 28 L.J. Ch. 396, 398.1235 Now conﬁning our attention to the category (a) which has given rise to the main controversy in this case, itappears to me quite clear that the phrase '.original domicile in Madhya Bharat"" used therein could not have beenmeant to indicate either the residence or the permanent home of the applicant in Madhya Bharat. What then isthe meaning intended to be conveyed thereby. Is the word ""domicile"" in this phrase to be understood in thelegalistic sense or as the likely framer of the relvant rule-possibly a lay man like the Director of Public Instruction ofthe State-would have understood it to mean. It is necessary for this purpose to have a clear idea of the concept of""domicile"" and its applicability in relation to any particular region within a country like India. Now the juristsconcept of domicile is one which can be best gathered from the following passage in the classic judgment of LordWestbury in Udny v. Udny(1).""The law of England, and of almost all civilized countries, ascribes to each individual at his birth two distinct legalstatuses or conditions; one by virtue of which he becomes the subject of some particular country, binding him bythe tie of natural allegiance and which may be called his political status; another by virtue of which he has ascribedto him the character of a citizen of some particular country, and as such is possessed of certain municipal rights,and subject to certain obligations, which latter character is the civil status or condition of the individual, and maybe quite diﬀerent from his political status. The political status may depend on diﬀerent laws in diﬀerent countries;whereas the civil status is governed universally by one single principle, namely, that of domicil, which is thecriterion established by law for the purpose of determining civil status. For it is on this basis that the personalrights of the party, that is to say, the law which determines his majority or minority, his marriage, succession,testacy, or intestacy, must depend"".Thus domicile is that attribute of a person's status which according to International Law determines (1) [ 1869] L.R1 Sc. & Div. 441, 457, 1236 the personal laws by which he is governed and on which his personal laws depend. Thequestion for consideration is whether this concept of domicile can apply to the word ""domicile"" in the phrase""domicile in Madhya Bharat"". Dicey in his Conﬂict of Laws (6th Edn.), at pages 43 and 78 says as follows:""A person's domicile (meaning thereby the place of domicile) is the country which is considered by law to be hispermanent home"" and at page 82 he says ""the area contemplated relating to domicile is a `country' or 'territorysubject to one system of law' Farnsworth in his book on the Residence and Domicil of Corporations (1939 Edition)says as follows at page 1:""In any consideration of domicile the area contemplated has always been taken to be a 'country' or Ca territorysubject to one system of law""'.It is no doubt true that there are countries which though politically one unit have diﬀerent personal laws, indiﬀerent areas thereof. In such a case the sub-unit which is governed by one system of law is the area of domicile.Thus for instance, as has been pointed out, though Great Britain is one single political unit, the personal laws inScotland are diﬀerent and therefore Scotch domicile is recognised. But this is a matter of historical growth.Now, so far as India is concerned it appears to me that there has so far been no such concept of domicile of sub-units known or recognised by law, for the only purpose for which it is normally relevant and which attracts it, viz.personal laws of the citizens of India. The personal laws in India, as is well known, depend mostly on religiousaﬃliations. This has been so from pre British period.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/02095953952195951012 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)The earliest British regulations have recognised this and the same has been continued by a speciﬁc provision beingincorporated in the Civil Courts Act or analogous Acts of the various Provinces or States to the eﬀect that theCourts are to decide matters relating to Hindus and Muhammadans, etc. with reference to their personal laws,These Acts 1237 have invariably a provision by way of a direction to the Courts concerned, more or less in thefollowing terms:""To decide any question regarding succession, inheritance, marriage, or caste, or any religious usage or institutionor the like by the Muhammadan law in cases where the parties are Muhammadans and by Hindu law in caseswhere the parties are Hindus"".In respect of some of these matters as well as in respect of other matters which properly fall within the category ofpersonal laws such as for instance minority, succession, etc., there have been legislative modiﬁcations. But it isnoteworthy that those modiﬁcations are almost entirely of an all-India character and not on anv regional basis (viz.Indian Majority Act, Indian Succession Act). So far as I am aware there are only a few instances of Provincial orState legislation on any matters relating to personal laws and that too, to an extremely small and limited extent.Thus it will be seen that the Province or the State of India to which a Hindu or Muslim belongs has no relevance orrelation to his personal laws. Indeed, the contrary is emphasised by the fact that, a Hindu at any rate, carries with.him even his own school of Hindu law in spite of migration to a diﬀerent Province or State. Now, so far as Indiancitizens who are neither Hindus nor Muslims are concerned, such as, Indian Christians or Anglo-Indians, they aregoverned by personal laws which are all-India %in character and not regional, as for instance the Indian SuccessionAct. (It may be mentioned that even in Europe until the middle ages, personal laws depended on race and not ondomicile. See Philippine on International Law, page 36). In this state of the factual situation as regards the personallaws of the various categories of persons who comprise the bulk of the population of India, it appears to me to beclear that there has been in India up to the present moment no scope for growth of any concept of State orProvincial domicile as distinct from Indian domicile. There is thus no place for regional domicile, in the existingIndian law. Nor is there any reason 1238 to think that such a situation will arise in the future under the presentConstitution. For this purpose, it may be noticed that the exclusive legislative power of the State does not extendto personal laws. Personal laws are the subject matter of item No. 5 of the Concurrent Legislative List. It is relevantin this connection also to notice that article 44 of the Constitution enjoins that ""the State shall endeavour to securefor the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India"". It is extremely unlikely therefore thatregional personal laws will be, allowed to become operative in any substantial measure. It may be also mentionedthat there is single citizenship under the Constitution for the whole of India and that ""citizenship andnaturalisation"" have been listed within the exclusive competence of the Union Legislature. Of course citizenship isdiﬀerent from domicile. But I mention this here only to emphasize the view, that consistently with theConstitution, the concept of regional domicile which does not exist at the present day and which if recognisedwould tend to the growth of claims of regional citizenship (as for instance in the United States of America) wouldbe entirely foreign to the intendment of the Constitution. It is with reference to the above considerations that thephrase ""domicile in Madhya Bharat"" in the relevant rule deﬁning the phrase ""bona ﬁde resident of Madhya Bharat""has to be considered and understood. Since the concept of domicile in Madhya Bharat, is, in my view, unknown tothe existing Indian law, I do not think it permissible to construe the phrase ""domicile in Madhya Bharat"" used in therelevant rule as having anything to do with the regional domicile of the kind known to the English system of law.The recognition of such a concept of regional domicile in English or American law does not necessitate that weshould import the same idea into our country contrary to the intendment of the Constitution. We have got toconsider the meaning of the phrase ""original domicile in Madhya Bharat"" used in the relevant rule with referenceto the existing state of law in India, which, I conceive, does not recognise such a regional domicile.1239 I have already given my reasons for thinking that the meaning of ""residence"" or ""permanent home"" of theapplicant cannot be read into the phrase ""domicile in Madhya Bharat"" used in clause (a). In the circumstances itappears to me to be reasonably clear that the phrase ""original domicile in Madhya Bharat"" is meant to convey the""place of birth (of the applicant) in Madhya Bharat"". It is perfectly true that ""domicile of origin"" and ""place of birth""are two diﬀerent matters. But that is so only where the use of the phrase ""domicile of origin"" conveys a deﬁnitelegal meaning. But where, as in the present case, the phrase ""domicile of origin in Madhya Bharat"" conveys nolegal meaning, as I have pointed out above, and if any meaning has to be attached to it, then it could only havereference to the ""place of birth"". This would accord with what was likely to have been contemplated by the framerof the rule. Normally a person's domicile of origin is the place of his birth except in a few and exceptional cases. Inthis context the following passage from Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 28 at page 1095 may be noticed:""A person's domicil of origin is the domicile of his birth.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 3.html/02095953952195951112 9/12/2D. P. JOSHI V . THE ST A TE OF MADHYA BHARAT & ANR [15] INSC 3; AIR 15 S C 34; 15 (1) SCR 15 (27 January 15)It is generally but not necessarily the place of birth"".In this connection it is to be remembered that the relevant rule is a substitute for the pre-existing rule which was asfollows:""Madhya Bharat students are exempted from capitation fees"".The phrase ""Madhya Bharat students"" has no reference either to residence or domicile, and there can be no doubtthat it normally connoted students who were born in Madhya Bharat.In my opinion when the State authorities took over the management of the institution from private hands andmade a change in the rule by coining a hybrid deﬁnition of the phrase ""bona ﬁde residents of Madhya Bharat""placing the category of citizens whose original domicile is in Madhya Bharat in the forefront of that deﬁnition, theyonly attempted to camouﬂage the 1240 implication thereof so as to accord with the pre-existing rule, viz. that thebeneﬁts of the exemption from capitation fees should be available only to persons born in Madhya Bharat and theburden of the capitation fees should be borne by persons not born in Madhya Bharat. In the view I take of the realmeaning and eﬀect of the rule, which is under discussion, neither an attempt at subsequent clariﬁcation nor theactual manner in which it is said to be administered or intended to be administered, as stated by the AssistantSecretary to the Madhya Bharat Government,, Shri H. L. Gupta, in his aﬃdavit, even if accepted as correct, canhave any bearing. The fact that some of the admitted students of the Medical College who are residents ofMadhya Bharat may not be entitled to exemption from capitation fee under the rule as now sought to beinterpreted is not relevant so long as a student in the position of the applicant cannot have the beneﬁt of theexemption, even if he got the highest marks in the competi- tion. In my view, therefore, the rule in question hasreference to place of birth in Madhya Bharat primarily, though a number of other miscellaneous categories mightalso come in under other and diﬀerent heads. Hence the rule oﬀends article 15 of the Constitution. Even in theview that the rule has reference to the juristic concept of regional domicil and for that reason does not fall withinthe scope of the inhibition of article 15, 1 am unable to see how, with reference to article 14, the distinction basedon such domicile can be considered reasonable. No sugges- tion has been put forward how ""original domicile inMadhya Bharat"" is a reasonable ground for classiﬁcation. In my opinion, therefore, the primary content of the rulerelating to capitation fees which is contained in clause (a) of the deﬁnition of ""bona ﬁde resident of MadhyaBharat"" does operate to the disadvantage of the petitioner by way of unconstitutional discrimination. Hence theState Government cannot validly seek to levy capitation fees on the petitioner with reference to that rule.I would, therefore, allow this application.1241 I think it right to add that the question as to the existence or admissibility of the concept of regional domicileas distinguished from Indian domicile and as to the bearing of this on the meaning of the concerned. rule were notcanvassed or suggested at the hearing A before us and that the Court has not bad the beneﬁt of arguments onthese and the connected matters. if, therefore, I have ventured to diﬀer, notwithstanding my respect for the viewsof the majority and notwithstanding the absence of assistance from the Bar, it is out of the conviction that therecognition, express or implied, of regional domicile by a decision of this Court would be contrary to theintendment of the Constitution.By COURT.-In accordance with the opinion of the majority, the Petition is dismissed without costs.Petition dismissed.",

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave from theorder of the Labour Appellate Tribunal, Bombay Bench, dated the 18th November 1954 which was made on anapplication made by the appellant company on the 6th September 1954 under section 22 of the Industrial Disputes(Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950 (Act XLVIII of 1950) which is hereinafter referred to as the 1950 Act.The appellant company carries on business as assemblers of motor vehicles from ""completely knocked down""assemblies imported into India. There was some appeal pending before the Labour Appellate Tribunal arising outof disputes between the appellant company and its workmen. It is alleged that the name of the appellant companyhad been removed by the Government of India from the list of approved manufacturers maintained by them andthat, in the result, it had been unable to secure further import licenses for the import of completely knocked downassemblies of motor vehicles and that consequently on and from the 1st November 1953 the company had to layoﬀ a number of its workmen, for it had to operate the various departments of its factory at greatly reducedstrength. As the appellant company saw no prospect of any increase in the scope of its present operation whichwould provide employment for the workmen who had been laid oﬀ, it had become necess- 1244 sary to retrenchthe workmen named in Annexure A to the application. As those workmen were concerned with the appealpending before the Labour Appellate Tribunal the company applied to the Appellate Tribunal under section 22 ofthe 1950 Act for permission to retrench them.The respondents through their Union, the Automobile Manufacturers' Employees' Association, Bombay, ﬁled awritten statement on the 1st November 1954 making diverse allegations against the company and contendingthat the company bad itself to blame for having brought about the lay oﬀ. It was contended that there was noimmediate cause for making the application, that the company was motivated by ulterior motives to deprive theworkmen of their dues which even according to the company would become due and payable to the workmen onthe expiry of the one year of the said lay oﬀ period. It was further alleged that in or about April 1954 the companyrecalled some of the workmen out of those who had been laid oﬀ since November 1953 violating all principles onwhich a recall should have been made and that by such arbitrary and unscientiﬁc recall the company had imposeddisproportionate work loads on the recalled workmen, thereby altering their conditions of service to theirprejudice. The respondents maintained that the application was not maintainable in law, was mala ﬁde and shouldbe dismissed. In the penultimate paragraph of the written statement it was submitted that in the event of theLabour Appellate Tribunal granting the permission in whole or in part such permission should be granted subject tothe following conditions:- (1) Payment of full wages with dearness allowance for the entire period of lay oﬀ;(2) Payment of one month's notice pay and retrenchment compensation at the rate of one month's wagesincluding dearness allowance for every completed year of service and part thereof in addition to the gratuity as per.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/4.h/020959559524wwwiiofindirasee95tml28 9/12/2THE AUT OMOBILE PRODUCTS OF INDIA LTD.

This contention was rejected by theAppellate Tribunal with the following observation:- ""That view is quite untenable as has been repeatedly held bythis Tribunal. We are the authority to whom an application has to be made for permission to retrench, and whensuch an application is made we must of necessity exercise our judgment and discretion and satisfy ourselves thatwhen the company retrenches it does justice by its employees"".The Labour Appellate Tribunal was clearly inﬂuenced by the consideration which, stated in its own words, was asfollows:- ""We do not think that we will be advancing the interest of the employees or of the concern by refusing1246 retrenchment because the case for retrenchment has been established, and the sooner the workmen areallowed to leave and ﬁnd for themselves other employment the better for them. But in order to assure ourselvesthat on retrenchment the employees receive what in justice they should have, we have decided to give permissionto retrench subject to cer- tain conditions which in our view are inherent under the Act., and which apart from theAct we consider to be just and equitable in the particular circumstances of this case"".In this view of the matter the Labour Appellate Tribunal deﬁnitely declined ""to leave over the question ofcompensation for lay oﬀ as a legacy of the present troubles; the employees to be retrenched have enough toworry them without having to make claims and have them decided after contest before a Tribunal"". In the result,the Labour Appellate Tribunal gave the appellant company permission to retrench ""subject to the terms andconditions of Act XLIII of 1953, provided that each workman is paid at the rate of half basic wages and dearnessallowance for the whole period from the date of lay oﬀ up to the date of retrenchment (less sums already receivedas lay oﬀ compensation)"". Liberty was given to the company to set oﬀ the lay oﬀ compensation protanto againstthe retrenchment relief given by the Act.Aggrieved by this decision the appellant company applied for and obtained from this Court special leave to appealagainst this order. The respondents subsequently ﬁled an application for special leave to appeal against thisdecision in so far as the Labour Appellate Tribunal had not allowed their full claim as surmmarised above and in sofar as the names of 17 persons had been struck oﬀ on the allegation of the company that they were not workmen.This application of the respondents was also acceded to and the two appeals have been heard together. The Unionof India asked for leave to intervene as important questions of construction of the provisions of the IndustrialDisputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the 1947 Act) and the 1950 Act were involved. Such 1247 leave wasgranted. and we have heard learned counsel for the Union of India along with learned counsel for the parties.The question as to the propriety of permitting the names of 17 workmen to be struck oﬀ from the application hasnot been seriously pressed before us. Only two questions have been canvassed at some length before us,namely-.- (1)Whether under section 22 of the 1950 Act the Tribunal has jurisdiction to impose conditions whengranting the permission asked for; and (2)Whether the conditions imposed in this case are in conformity with law.It is plain, however, that in case the ﬁrst question is answered in the negative, the second question will not call forany decision on the present occasion..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/4.h/020959559524wwwiiofindirasee95tml38 9/12/2THE AUT OMOBILE PRODUCTS OF INDIA LTD. V. RUKMAJI BALA & ORS [15] INSC 4; AIR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SCR 11 (…In order to correctly answer the questions it will be necessary to bear in mind the general scheme of the two Acts.The purpose of the 1947 Act is, inter alia, to make provision for the investigation and settlement of industrialdisputes. In order to achieve this avowed object diﬀerent authorities have been constituted under this Act. Thussection 3 provides for the constitution of Works Committee whose duty is to promote measures for securing andpreserving amity and good relations between the employers and workmen. The appropriate Government isauthorised by section 4 to appoint conciliation oﬃcers charged with the duty of mediating in and promoting thesettlement of industrial disputes and by section 5 to constitute a Board of Conciliation for promoting thesettlement of industrial disputes. Section 6 empowers the appropriate Government to constitute a Court of Inquiryfor enquiring into any matter appearing to be connected with or relevant to an industrial dispute. Finally, section 7provides for the constitution of Industrial Tribunals for the adjudication of industrial disputes in accordance withthe provisions of the Act.Section 10 of this Act provides for reference of disputes to a Board, Court or Tribunal. It will be noticed that underthis section it is the appropriate 160 1248 Government which alone can make the reference and set the authority inmotion. The procedure, powers and duties of conciliation oﬃcers, Boards, Courts and Tribunals are elaboratelyprescribed and deﬁned in sections I 1 to 15.It is to be noted that the conciliation oﬃcer, Board, and Court are required to make a report to the appropriateGovernment while the Tribunal is enjoined to submit its award to the appropriate Government. The report of aBoard or Court and the award of a Tribunal are under section 17 to be published by the appropriate Governmentwithin a month from the date of their receipt. Section 17-A provides that the award of a Tribunal shall becomeenforceable on the expiry of 30 days from the date of its publication and, subject to the provisions of sub-section(1) shall come into operation from such date as may be speciﬁed therein and if no date is so speciﬁed from the datewhen the award becomes enforceable as aforesaid. Section 19 prescribes the period of operation of settlementsand awards. Chapter deals with strikes and lock-outs. Sections 26 to 31 which are grouped together under theheading ""Penalties"" prescribe punishments. Section 31 (I) provides that any employer who contravenes theprovisions of section 33 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months or withﬁne which may extend to Rs. 1,000 or with both.Section 33, a contravention of which is made punishable by section 31, as it stood before 1950, forbade anemployer, during the pendency of any conciliation proceedings or proceedings before a Tribunal, to alter, to theprejudice of the workmen concerned in the dispute, the conditions of service applicable to them immediatelybefore such proceedings, nor, save with the express permission of the conciliation oﬃcer, Board or Tribunal, as thecase may be, to discharge, dismiss or otherwise punish during the pendency of the proceedings any workman,except for misconduct not connected with the dispute. It may be noted that under this section the ban on thealteration of the conditions of service was absolute and that permission was necessary only in case of discharge ordismissal or 1249 punishment and even in such case no permission was necessary when the workman was guilty ofmisconduct not concerned with the pending dispute. The Only deterrent against a contravention by an employerof the provisions of section 33 was the prosecution of the employer under section 31. This was hardly anyconsolation for the workmen, for if an employer took the risk of a prosecution and acted in contra- vention ofsection 33 the workmen could only raise an industrial dispute and ask the appropriate Government to refer thesame to a Tribunal but if the Government declined to accede to their prayer the workmen were without anyremedy. This was the position under the 1947 Act before it was amended in 1950.The 1950 Act was enacted for establishing an Appellate Tribunal in relation to industrial disputes. Chapter II of theAct deals with the constitution, composition and functions of the appellate tribunal. Section 7 formulates thejurisdiction of the appellate tribunal. Section 9 confers on the appellate tribunal all the powers which are vested ina Civil Court when hearing an appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Section 10 prescribes the period oflimitation within which appeals are to be brought before the appellate tribunal. Under section 15 the decision ofthe appellate tribunal becomes enforceable on the expiry of 30 days from the date of its pronouncement, providedthat where the appropriate Government is of opinion that it would be inexpedient, on public grounds, to giveeﬀect to the whole or any part of the decision the appropriate Government may, before the expiry of the saidperiod of 30 days, by order in the Oﬃcial Gazette either reject the decision or modify it. Section 22 of this Actprovides:""22. During the period of thirty days allowed for the ﬁling of an appeal under section 10 or during the pendency ofany appeal under this Act, no employer sball- (a) alter, to the prejudice of the workmen concerned in such appeal,the conditions of service applicable to them immediately before the ﬁling of such appeal, or 1250 (b)discharge or.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/4.h/020959559524wwwiiofindirasee95tml48 9/12/2THE AUT OMOBILE PRODUCTS OF INDIA LTD.

Where an employer contravenes the provisions of section 22 during the pendency of proceedingsbefore the Appellate Tribunal, any employee aggrieved by such contravention, may make a complaint in writing, inthe prescribed manner to such Appellate Tribunal and on receipt of such complaint, the Appellate Tribunal shalldecide the complaint as if it were an appeal pending before it, in accordance with the provisions of this Act andshall pronounce its decision thereon and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly"".' Section 29 of this Actprovides for penalty for con- travention of the provisions of section 22, namely, imprisonment for a term whichmay extend to six months, or with ﬁne which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both. From what hasbeen stated so far four things are to be noted, namely, (i) that the ordinary and primary jurisdiction of theappellate tribunal is appellate, (ii) that section 22 of this Act confers on the appellate tribunal a special jurisdictionwhich is in the nature of original jurisdiction, (iii) that section 23 also vests in the tribunal an additional jurisdictionto decide the complaint as if it were an appeal pending before it; and (iv) that section 23 confers on the workmenan additional remedy which they did not have under the 1947 Act.To ﬁll up the lacuna in the 1947 Act section 34 of the 1950 Act provided for certain amendments of the 1947 Act.Amongst other things, it substituted a new section for the old section 33 of the 1947 Act. The new section 33 runsas follows-- ""33. During the pendency of any conciliation proceedings or proceedings before a Tribunal in respectof any industrial dispute, no employer- shall- 1251 (a)alter, to the prejudice of the workmen concerned in suchdispute, the conditions of service applicable to them immediately before the commencement of such proceedings;or (b)discharge or punish, whether by dismissal or otherwise, any workman concerned in such dispute, save withthe express permission in writing of the conciliation oﬃcer, Board or Tribunal, as the case may be"".It will be noticed that this section has made several changes. Thus under this section provision is made forobtaining permission as a condition precedent both for altering the conditions of service and for discharging orpunishing the workmen and no exception is made for a case of misconduct unconnected with the pending dispute.Besides this, the following new section was added to the 1947 Act as section 33-""33-A. Where an employer contravenes the provisions of section 33 during the pendency of proceedings before aTribunal, any employee aggrieved by such contravention, may make a complaint in writing, in the prescribedmanner to such Tribunal and on receipt of such complaint that Tribunal shall adjudicate upon the complaint as if itwere a dispute referred to or pending before it, in accordance with the provisions of this Act and shall submit itsaward to the appropriate Government and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly"".It may be pointed out that the new sections 33 and 33-A thus inserted into the 1947 Act confer distinct beneﬁts onthe workmen and give some additional jurisdiction and power to the authorities mentioned therein. Section 33-Aenjoins the Tribunal to decide the complaint ""as if it were a dispute referred to or pending before it"" and to submitits award to the appropriate Government and provides that the provisions of the Act shall apply to the award. It isquite clear that the provisions of these two new sections 33 and 33-A of the 1947 Act correspond to and are in parimateria with the provisions of sections 22 and 23 of the 1950 Act and are more or less in similar terms. Thequestion for our conside- 1252 ration is: What are the meaning, scope and eﬀect of these sections.A cursory perusal of section 33-A of the 1947 Act as well as section 23 of the 1950 Act will at once show that it is thecontravention by the employer of the provisions of section 33 in the ﬁrst case and of section 22 in the second casethat gives rise to a cause of action in favour of the workmen to approach and move the respective authority namedin the section and this contravention is the condition precedent to the exercise by the authority concerned of theadditional jurisdiction and powers conferred on it by the sections. The authority referred to in the sections is, as wehave seen, a Court of limited jurisdiction and must accordingly be strictly conﬁned to the exercise of the functionsand powers actually conferred on it by the Act which constituted it. What, then, are the scope and ambit of thefunctions and powers with which it has been vested by these sections? When an employer contravenes theprovisions of section 33 of the 1947 Act or of section 22 of the 1950 Act the workmen aﬀected thereby obviouslyhave a grievance. That grievance is two-fold. In the ﬁrst place it is that the employer has taken a prejudicial actionagainst them without the express permission in writing of the authority concerned and thereby deprived them ofthe salutary safeguard which the legislature has provided for their protection against victimisation. In the secondplace, and apart from the ﬁrst grievance which may be called the statutory grievance, the workmen may also havea grievance on merits which may be of much more seriousness and gravity for them, namely, that in point of fact.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/4.h/020959559524wwwiiofindirasee95tml58 9/12/2THE AUT OMOBILE PRODUCTS OF INDIA LTD. V. RUKMAJI BALA & ORS [15] INSC 4; AIR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SCR 11 (…they have been unfairly dealt with in that their interest has actually been prejudicially aﬀected by the highhandedact of the employer. These sections give the workmen the right to move the authority by lodging a complaintbefore it. This is a distinct beneﬁt given to them, for, as we have seen, apart from these sections, the workmenhave no right to refer any dispute for adjudication.This complaint is required to be made in the prescribed manner. Form DD prescribed by rule 51-A of the Industrial1253 Disputes (Central) Rules, 1947, framed under section 38 of the 1947 Act, like Form E prescribed under section35 of the 1950 Act, requires the complaining workmen to show in their petition of complaint not only the mannerin which the alleged contravention has taken place but also the grounds on which the order or the act of themanagement is challenged. This clearly indicates that the authority to whom the complaint is made is to decideboth the issues, namely (1) the fact of contravention and (2) the merits of the act or order of the employer. It is alsoclear that under section 33-A of the 1947 Act the authority is to adjudicate upon the complaint ""as if it were adispute referred to or pending before it"" and under section 23 of the 1950 Act the authority is to decide thecomplaint ""as if it were an appeal pending before it"". These provisions quite clearly indicate that the jurisdiction ofthe authority is not only to decide whether there has been a failure on the part of the employer to obtain thepermission of the authority before taking action but also to go into the merits of the complaint and grantappropriate reliefs.The extreme contention that under section 33-A of the 1947 Act, on a ﬁnding that there has been a contraventionof the provisions of section 33, the Tribunal's duty is only to make a declaration to that eﬀect, leaving the workmento take such steps under the Act as they may be advised to do, has been negatived by the Labour AppellateTribunal in Serampore Belting Mazdoor Union v. Serampore Belting Co., Ltd.(1) and by the Bombay High Court inBatuk K. Vyas v.Surat Borough Municipality(1). The same principle has been accepted and applied by a Full Bench of the LabourAppellate Tribunal to a case under section 23 of the 1950 Act in Raj Narain v. Employers' Association of NorthernIndia(1). We ﬁnd ourselves in agreement with the construction placed upon section 33-A of the 1947 Act andsection 23 of the 1950 Act by these decisions. In our view the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction conferred on theauthority named in those (1) (1951) 2 Lab. L.J. 341.(2) [ 1952] 54 Bom. L.R. 922.(3) [ 1962] 1 Lab. L.J. 381, 1254 sections is wider than that conferred on the Criminal Court by section 31 of the 1947Act and section 29 of the 1950 Act. The Criminal Court under the two last mentioned sections is only concernedwith the ﬁrst issue herein before mentioned, namely, yea or nay whether there has been a contravention of therespective provisions of the sections mentioned therein, but the authority exercising jurisdiction under section 33-A of the 1947 Act and section 23 of the 1950 Act is to adjudicate upon or decide the complaint ""as if it were adispute referred to or pending before it"" in the ﬁrst case or ""as if it were an appeal pending before it"" in the secondcase. The authority is, therefore, enjoined to go into the merits of the act complained of under section 33-A of the1947 Act and section 23 of the 1950 Act. In this sense the jurisdiction of the authority named in these two sectionsis certainly wider than that of the Criminal Court exercising jurisdiction under the penal sections referred to above.Having regard to the scope of the enquiry under section 33-A of the 1947 Act and section 23 of the 1950 Act it mustfollow that the power of the authority to grant relief must be co-extensive with its power to grant relief on areference made to it or on an appeal brought before it, as the case may be. The provision that the authorityconcerned must submit its award to the appropriate Government and that the provisions of the respective Actswould be applicable thereto also support the view that the decision of the authority is to partake of the nature of adecision on the merits of an industrial dispute which when published by the appropriate Government will becomeenforceable under the- respective Acts. It follows, therefore, that the authority referred to in these sections musthave jurisdiction to do complete justice between the parties relating to the matters in dispute and must havepower to give such relief as the nature of the case may require and as is also indicated by the prayer clausementioned in the two Forms DD and E referred to above. In short, these two sections give to the workmen a directright to approach the Tribunal or Appellate Tribunal for the 1255 redress of their grievance without theintervention of the appropriate Government which they did not possess before 1950 and they provide for speedydetermination of disputes and avoid multiplicity of proceedings by giving complete relief to the workmen inrelation to their grievances arising out of the action taken by the employer in contravention of the provisions ofthe relevant sections.It is signiﬁcant that this jurisdiction or power has been vested in the Tribunal or Appellate Tribunal whose normalduty is to decide or adjudicate upon industrial disputes and not on any conciliation oﬃcer or Board who are.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/4.h/020959559524wwwiiofindirasee95tml68 9/12/2THE AUT OMOBILE PRODUCTS OF INDIA LTD. V. RUKMAJI BALA & ORS [15] INSC 4; AIR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SCR 11 (…normally charged with the duty of bringing about settlement of dis- putes.it is submitted by learned counsel for the Respondents and of the intervener that the scope of section 33 of the1947 Act and of section 22 of the 1950 Act is precisely the same as that of section 33-A of the 1947 Act and section23 of the 1950 Act. The argument is that the two last mentioned sections were enacted only in order to aﬀord anopportunity to the workmen to do what they had been prevented from doing at the earlier stage by reason of theemployer taking the law into his own hands and taking action against them without previously obtaining thesanction of the appropriate authority to do so. If the law permits the workmen to ventilate their grievances at alater stage under section 33-A of the 1947 Act and section 23 of the 1950 Act there can be no logical reason why thelaw should not permit them to do so at the earlier stage under section 33 of the 1947 Act and section 22 of the 1950Act. It is submitted that the purpose of labour legislation being to maintain industrial peace and restore amity andgoodwill between the employer and his workmen, it should be the attempt of the Tribunal or the AppellateTribunal at every stage to try to resolve all disputes which are connected with the matter which is brought beforeit. Finally, it is urged that whenever an authority is vested with the power to do or not to do an act it must beregarded as having a discretion and 161 1256 that in exercise of such discretion the authority must be presumed tobe vested with power to impose suitable conditions. Reliance is placed on the decision in The Queen v. CountyCouncil of West Riding of Yorkshire(1). The argument is that the authority concerned may under section 33 of the1947 Act and section 22 of the 1950 Act grant by way of imposing conditions the same relief which it can grant tothe workmen under section 33-A of the 1947 Act and section 23 of the 1950 Act. We are unable to accept thiscontention as correct for reasons which we now proceed to state.The object of section 22 of the 1950 Act like that of section 33 of the 1947 Act as amended is to protect theworkmen concerned in disputes which form the subject-matter of pending proceedings against victimisation bythe employer on account of their having raised industrial disputes or their continuing the pending proceedings. It isfurther the object of the two sections to ensure that proceedings in connection with industrial disputes alreadypending should be brought to a termination in a peaceful atmosphere and that no employer should during thependency of those pro- ceedings take any action of the kind mentioned in the sections which may give rise to freshdisputes likely to further exacerbate the already strained relation between the employer and the workmen. Toachieve this object a ban has been imposed upon the ordinary right which the employer has under the ordinary lawgoverning a contract of employment.Section 22 of the 1950 Act and section 33 of the 1947 Act which impose the ban also provide for the removal of thatban by the granting of express permission in writing in appropriate cases by the authority mentioned therein. Thepurpose of these two sections being to determine whether the ban should be removed or not, all that is required ofthe authority exercising jurisdiction under these sections is to accord or withhold permission. And so it has beenheld-we think rightly-by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Carlsbad Mineral Works Co. Ltd. v. Their (1) [ 1S96] 2,Q.B. 386.1257 Workmen(1) which was a case under section 33 of the 1947 Act. Even a cursory persual of section 33 of the1947 Act will make it clear that the purpose of that section was not to confer any general power of adjudication ofdisputes. It will be noticed that under section 33 of the 1947 Act the authority invested with the power of grantingor withholding permission is the conciliation oﬃcer, Board or Tribunal.The conciliation oﬃcer or the Board normally has no power, under the 1947 Act, to decide any industrial disputebut is only charged with the duty of bringing about a settlement of dispute. It is only the Tribunal which can by itsaward decide a dispute referred to it. 'Section 33 by the same language confers jurisdiction and power on all thethree authorities. Power being thus conferred by one and the same section, it cannot mean one thing in relation tothe conciliation oﬃcer or the Board and a diﬀerent and larger thing in relation to the Tribunal. There is no reasonto think that the legislature, by a side wind as it were, vested in the conciliation oﬃcer and the Board thejurisdiction and power of adjudicating upon disputes which they normally do not possess and which they may notbe competent or qualiﬁed to exercise. Further, if the purpose of the section was to invest all the authorities namedtherein with power to decide industrial disputes one would have expected some provision enabling them to makeand submit an award to which the provisions of the Act would apply such as is provided in section 33-A of the 1947Act or section 23 of the 1950 Act. There is no machinery provided in section 33 of the 1947 Act or section 23 of the1950 Act for enforcing the decision of the authority named in those sections. This also indicates that thosesections only impose a ban on the right of the employer and the only thing that the authority is called upon to do isto grant or withhold the permission, i.e. to lift or maintain the ban..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/4.h/020959559524wwwiiofindirasee95tml78 9/12/2THE AUT OMOBILE PRODUCTS OF INDIA LTD.

As the respondent hadmigrated from India to Pakistan after the 1st March, 1947, her case fell under Art. 7 of the Constitution and thatinasmuch as it was a case of an unauthorised issue of an invalid permit which had been properly cancelled theproviso to Art. 7 did not apply and that therefore the respondent could not be deemed to be a citizen of India.Held also, that the deﬁnitions of the phrase "" evacuee property"" in the Administration of Evacuee PropertyOrdinance 1949 and the Administration of Evacuee Property Act 1950 (XXXI of 1950) clearly include the interest ofan evacuee in any property held as a trustee or beneﬁciary.The deﬁnition of evacuee property in Evacuee Property Ordinance 1949 (Bihar Ordinance No. III of 1949) is not1260 diﬀerent and the words used therein comprise also wakf property and any interest therein.","Civil Appeals Nos. 97 and 98 of 1952.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/IC/ 15/5.html/020THTTUINGR95NS95895C2595NS9515 9/12/2E SAE OF BIHAR V.

I to 4.1955. February 10. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-These are two connectedappeals arising out of a. common judgment of the High Court of Patna on two applications to it dated the 5th July,1950 and 28th July, 1950, under article 226 of the Constitution. The State of Bihar is the appellant in both theappeals. The ﬁrst three respondents in Appeal No. 97 are the sons of the fourth respondent therein, viz. KumarRani Sayeeda Khatoon (hereinafter referred to as Kumar Rani). The said Kumar Rani is also the ﬁrst respondent inAppeal No. 98. The other respondents in both the appeals are Government Oﬃcers under the appellant, the Stateof Bihar. The applications before the High Court arose with reference to action taken against (1) the property, and(2) the person, of Kumar Rani by the Oﬃcers of the Government of Bihar, under the following circumstances.Kumar Rani was admittedly born in the territory of India and claims to be the lawfully wedded wife of CaptainMaharaj Kumar Gopal Saran Narayan Singh of Gaya by virtue of an alleged marriage between them in 1920according to Arya Samaj rites and subsequently according to Muslim rites, She owned and 1261 possessedconsiderable properties. In 1946 she created a wakf of her properties consisting of 427 villages for the maintenanceand support of herself, her sons and their descendants, by executing a deed of Wakf-ulalAulad dated the 4th May,1946, by which she divested herself of all her interest in the said properties and vested them in Almighty God. Sheappointed, herself as the sole mutwalli for her life time or until relinquishment, and her three sons to succeed heras joint mutwallis. The deed also provided that the net income was to be spent for the maintenance of herself andher three sons with the direction that not more than half should be spent by the wakifa for her own use. In July,1948, Kumar Rani went to Karachi. In December, 1948, she returned to India from Pakistan on a temporary permitand went back to Pakistan in April, 1949. On the 21st June, 1949, the Bihar Administration of Evacuee PropertyOrdinance, 1949 (Bihar Ordinance No. III of 1949) came into force. The Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Propertyissued a notiﬁcation on the 2nd September, 1949, under section 5 of this Ordinance, declaring all the propertiescomprised in the abovementioned wakf estate to have vested in the Custodian as being evacuee property. He tookpossession thereof between the 20th September and 2nd October, 1949.On the 14th May, 1950, Kumar Rani again came back to India under a permanent permit obtained from the HighCommissioner for India in Pakistan. This permit was, however, cancelled on the 12th July, 1950, by the DeputyHigh Cominissioner,on the ground that this was wrongly issued, without the concurrence of the Government, a.-,required by the rules made under the Inﬂux from Pakistan (Control) Act, 1949. In view of this cancellation, the Sub-Inspector of Police, Gaya, issued notice to Kumar Rani directing her that since her permanent permit had beencancelled, she should leave lndia by the 31st July, 1950. In view of these happenings two applications were ﬁledbefore the High Court of Patna, one dated the 5th July, 1950, challenging the validity of the action taken by theDeputy Custodian declaring the wakf estate as evacuee property and taking posses- 1262 sion thereof on the basisof that declaration, and another application dated the 28th July, 1950, challenging the validity of the order of theSub-Inspector of Police, Gaya, directing Kumar Rani to leave India. The ﬁrst of these applications was ﬁled byKumar Rani along with her three sons as petitioners and the second by Kumar Rani alone.Both these applications were allowed by the High Court and hence these appeals by the State on leave granted bythe High Court. These two connected appeals came up for hearing be-fore this Court on the 26th and 27thOctober, 1953. This Court after hearing counsel on both sides was of the opinion that one of the essential facts (tobe mentioned in detail herein below when dealing with Appeal No. 97) requisite for a proper decision of AppealNo. 97 had been assumed without investigation and that it was necessary to have a ﬁnding thereupon after takingevidence. This Court accordingly re- manded Appeal No. 97 to the High Court to submit a ﬁnding and directed thaton the receipt of the ﬁnding both the appeals (Appeals Nos. 97 and 98) should be heard together.The ﬁnding has now been received and the appeals have been re heard. It is necessary at this stage to mentionthat the advocate who appeared for the respondents in both the appeals at the prior hearing appeared before usat this hearing and stated that he had been instructed to withdraw his appearance in these appeals and to allowthe hearing to proceed ex parte.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/IC/ 15/5.html/020THTTUINGR95NS95895C2595NS9525 9/12/2E SAE OF BIHAR V. KMA R AMA R SH & OS [15] IC 5; AIR 15 SC 22; 15 (1) SR 19 (10 Fe bru ary 15)The preliminary facts having been stated as above, it will now be convenient to deal with these two appealsseparately.Appeal No. 98 which raises the fundamental question as to the continuing citizenship of Kumar Rani will be takenup ﬁrst.Civil Appeal No. 98 of 1952.This appeal arises out of the application to the High Court dated the 28th July, 1950, challenging the validity of theorder dated the 23rd July, 1950, issued by the Sub-Inspector of Police, Gaya. This order is challenged on the groundthat Kumar Rani was, and throughout continued to be, a citizen of India and 1263 that the order dated the 23rdJuly, 1950, which, in substance, amounted to an order of her externment from India, was in violation of KumarRani' s fundamental right under article 19 of the Constitution as a citizen of India.The question that arises is whether, in the circumstances, Kumar Rani was a citizen of India at the date of theorder.The contention of Kumar Rani is that though it is a fact that she did go to Pakistan in the year 1948, she went thereonly for a temporary purpose, viz. for securing the medical treatment of a reputed Hakim and that she was alwaysand continued to be a citizen of India and that, therefore, the High Commissioner for India in Pakistan had nopower to cancel the permit issued to her. As regards her allegation that when she ﬁrst went to Karachi in July,1948, she did so temporarily for the purpose of medical treatment, the learned Judges of the High Court were notinclined to accept her story. But, all the same, they held that she was and continued to be a citizen of India, on theground that she was born in India and that her domicile continued to be that of her husband, Captain MaharajKumar Gopal Saran Narayan Singh, who, it is not disputed, throughout continued to be in India. The learnedJudges of the High Court apparently had article 5 of the Constitution in mind and acted on the view of the Englishlaw that the wife' s domicile continues throughout to be that of her husband during the continuance of marriage. Itappears to us, with respect, that the learned Judges of the High Court completely overlooked article 7 of theConstitution. The relevant portion of article 5 of the Constitution says as follows:"" At the commencement of this Constitution, every person who has his domicile in the territory of India and whowas born in the territory of India shall be a citizen of India"".In the view of the High Court since Kumar Rani was born in India and bad the Indian domicile of her husband, shewas a citizen of India. But article 7 says:"" Notwithstanding anything in article 5, a person 162 1264 who has after the ﬁrst day of March, 1947, migratedfrom the territory of India to the territory now included in Pakistan shall not be deemed to be a citizen of India"".There is a proviso to this article which will be noticed presently. But before noticing the proviso and its eﬀect, it isnecessary to mention the following facts which may be taken to have been made out on the record. (1) Kumar Raniwent to Karachi in July, 1948. (2) Her story that she went there temporarily for medical treatment has beendoubted by the High Court and appears to us to be unfounded. (3) When she came to India in December, 1948, shedid so on a temporary permit stating in her application for the said permit that she was domiciled in Pakistan andaccordingly representing herself to be a Pakistani national. (4) She went back to Pakistan in April, 1949, on theexpiry of that temporary permit. (5) She made an attempt to obtain a permit for permanent return to India onlyafter steps had been taken to vest the property in the Custodian and after the same was taken possession of.There can be no doubt on these facts that she must be held to have migrated from the territory of India after the1st March, 1947. Even if therefore article 5 can be said to be applicable to her on the assumption that CaptainNarayan Singh was her husband and that her domicile was that of her husband, the facts bring her case underarticle 7. Article 7 clearly overrides article 5. It is peremptory in its scope and makes no exception for such a case,i.e., of the wife migrating to Pakistan leaving her husband in India. Even such a wife must be deemed not to be acitizen of India unless the particular facts bring her case within the proviso to article 7. This proviso is as follows:"" Provided that nothing in this article shall apply to a person who, after having so migrated to the territory nowincluded in Pakistan, has returned to the territory of India under a permit for resettlement or permanent returnissued by or under the authority of any law"".It is contended with reference to this proviso that 1265 since she in fact returned under a permanent permit, she isentitled to the beneﬁt there of and that the subsequent cancellation of the said permit is both illegal andwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/IC/ 15/5.html/020THTTUINGR95NS95895C2595NS9535 9/12/2E SAE OF BIHAR V. KMA R AMA R SH & OS [15] IC 5; AIR 15 SC 22; 15 (1) SR 19 (10 Fe bru ary 15)irrelevant. Rule 10 of the Permit System Rules, 1949, framed by the Central Government under section 4 of theInﬂux from Pakistan (Control) Act, 1949, provides that a permit for permanent resettlement in India may begranted by the High Commissioner or Deputy High Commissioner only after securing the agreement of the Stateor the Province where the applicant intends to settle. Rule 29 provides that every permit issued under the rulesshall be liable to cancellation at any time, without any reason being assigned by the issuing authority. In thepresent case, the permit has been cancelled in a reasoned order on the ground that, on the facts of the case, theconsent of the State Government concerned should have been obtained before the permit could be issued. This isa case, therefore, not of a valid permanent permit having been issued and the permit holder returning to India onthe strength thereof and the same having been arbitrarily cancelled. It is a case of an unauthorised issue of aninvalid permit which has been properly cancelled. Hence the proviso to article 7 can have no possible application.The applicant, is, therefore, not a citizen of India and the order passed by the Sub-Inspector of Police, Gaya, datedthe 23rd July, 1950, directing Kumar Rani to leave India was accordingly valid. This appeal must therefore succeed.Civil Appeal No. 97 of 1952.This appeal arises out of the application to the High Court dated the 5th July, 1950, challenging the validity of thenotiﬁcation dated the 2nd September 1949, issued by the Deputy Custodian under the Bihar Administration ofEvacuee Property Ordinance, 1949, declaring the wakf estate as evacuee property and taking possession thereof.Three main grounds on which this has been contested are as follows: (1) Kumar Rani was not an evacuee. (2) Shehad written a letter dated the 2nd June, 1949, addressed to her ,second son, Kumar Fateh Singh, whereby sherelin- 1266 quished the oﬃce of mutwalli in the wakf estate, and therefore by virtue of the said letter and inpursuance of the terms of the original deed of wakf, her three sons, respondents I to 3, had become the jointmutwallis as well as the owners of the beneﬁcial interest in the wakf estate.It being undisputed that these three remained in India throughout, it is contended that the property at the date ofthe notiﬁcation was the property of these three sons and not of Kumar Rani and that, therefore, the BiharAdministration of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949, has no application to the facts. (3) The Bihar Administrationof Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949, is not applicable to wakf property and to the beneﬁcial interest of theapplicants therein. So far as the ﬁrst point is concerned an "" evacuee"" is deﬁned as follows in the BiharAdministration of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949:"" A person who, on account of the setting up of the Dominions of India and Pakistan or on account of civildisturbances or the fear of such disturbances, leaves or has, on or after the 1st day of November, 1946, left, anyplace in the Province of Bihar for any place outside the territories now forming part of India"".It is clear that, as already found above, Kumar Rani migrated to Pakistan from India after the 1st March, 1947.In view of the fact that her plea as to the reason for such migration has not been accepted, she can well be taken tohave left India for Pakistan in the circumstances set out in this deﬁnition, and after the prescribed date. She has,therefore, been rightly taken to be' an "" evacuee"" by the Custodian. As regards the second point, the allegedrelinquishment of the oﬃce of mutwalli by Kumar Rani and the vesting of the interest in the wakf property in herthree sons, respondents 1 to 3, as joint mutwallis thereof, by virtue of the terms of the' deed of wakf, is based on aletter addressed to the second respondent, her second son Kumar Fateh Singh, purporting to have been written byher and dated the 2nd June, 1949. The genuineness of this letter has been challenged and it is the issue as to it1267 genuineness that was remanded to the High Court for a ﬁnding by the previous order of this Court. The 7 HighCourt having taken evidence on the matters at the hearing after remand and having considered the same, hasclearly found that the letter was not genuine. We have gone through the ﬁnding and the material relevant thereto,and can ﬁnd no reason not to accept it. There is, therefore, no substance in this second contention. As regards thethird point, the contention is based on the deﬁnition of the phrase "" evacuee property"" in the Bihar Administrationof Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949, which is as follows:"" Evacuee property means any property in which an evacuee has any right or interest or which is held by him underany deed of trust or other instrument"". It is contended that this deﬁnition does not apply either to the wakfproperty or to the beneﬁcial interest of the mutwalli therein and that, therefore, the property in question did notvest in the Custodian. Now, as already stated, the original notiﬁcation vesting the wakf property in the Custodianwas made under section 5 of the Bihar Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949. This Ordinance wasrepealed by section 55(2) of Central Ordinance No. XXVII of 1949. The Central Ordinance deﬁned "" evacueeproperty"" as "" any property in which an evacuee has any right or interest, whether personal or as a trustee or asbeneﬁciary or in any other capacity"".www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/IC/ 15/5.html/020THTTUINGR95NS95895C2595NS9545 9/12/2E SAE OF BIHAR V. KMA R AMA R SH & OS [15] IC 5; AIR 15 SC 22; 15 (1) SR 19 (10 Fe bru ary 15)The Central Ordinance was in turn repealed by Cenral Act No.XXXI of 1950 and "" evacuee property"" has been deﬁned therein as meaning "" any property of an evacuee whetherheld by him as owner or as a trustee or as a beneﬁciary or as a tenant or in any other capacity"".The word "" property""property"". is deﬁned as meaning "" property of any kind and includes any right or interest in suchThe Central Ordinance which repealed the Bihar Ordinance as well as the Central Act which repealed the CentralOrdinance, each contain section 8(2) providing that 1268 "" where immediately before the commencement of thisOrdinance (Act) any evacuee property in a Province has vested in any person exercising the power of Custodianunder any law repealed hereby, the evacuee property shall on the commencement of the Ordinance (Act) bedeemed to have been vested in the Custodian appointed or deemed to have been appointed for the Provinceunder the Ordinance (Act) and shall continue to so vest"".The deﬁnitions of the phrase "" evacuee property"" in the Central Ordinance and by the Central Act are clear andunambiguous so as to include the interest of an evacuee in any property held as a trustee or beneﬁciary. There isno reason to think that "" evacuee property"" as deﬁned in the Bihar Ordinance was meant to be anything diﬀerent.The words used in this deﬁnition are of suﬃcient amplitude and we are of the opinion that the Bihar deﬁnitioncomprised also wak property and interest therein. We are also of the opinion that the successive repeals of theBihar Ordinance by the Central Ordinance and the Central Act and the continuance of the vesting in the Custodian,places the matter beyond any doubt. This contention must, therefore, fail. This appeal also must accordinglysucceed.In the result both the appeals are allowed. The appellant in the circumstances will get only the costs incurredbefore the High Court on remand in Civil Appeal No. 97 of 1952.Appeals allowed."

THE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGH & ORS [1955] INSC 6; AIR 1955 SC 314; 1955 (1) SCR 1268 (22 February 1955).pdf,"The ﬁrst respondent-Municipality-governed by the Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925 (Bombay Act XVIII of 1925)consists of 32 councillors, S, (the appellant) being one of them. The last general election to the Municipality tookplace on the 7th May 1951. The term of the councillors was three years computed from the ﬁrst meeting held on10th July 1951 after the general election. In that meeting the 4th and 5th respondents were elected President andVice-President respectively for a term of three years. Act XVIII of 1925 was amended by Bombay Act XXXV of 1954under which the term of oﬃce of the councillors was extended from 3 to 4 years ending on 9th July 1955. As theterm of respondents 4 and 5 was to expire at the end of three years from the 10th July 1951 and as the term of theMunicipality was extended by one year under the Amending Act XXXV of 1954 a fresh election of President andVicePresident was necessary to ﬁll up the vacancies thus occurring. The Collector called a special general meetingfor the 30th July 1954 to elect a President and Vice-President for the remaining period of the quadrennium andnominated the Prant Oﬃcial (the District Deputy Collector) to preside over that meeting. On the 30th July 1954the Prant Oﬃcer adjourned the meeting to the 3rd August 1954 under instructions from the Collector withouttransacting any business. The objection raised by respondent No. 3 against the adjournment was overruled by thepresiding Oﬃcer. The special general meeting was held on the 3rd August 1954. An objection raised by S (theappellant) that under the provisions of the Act a President could not be elected for a term less than a year wasoverruled by the presiding Oﬃcer. On this 13 councillors (including S) out of the 32 who were present walked outon the ground that the President was to be elected for a term less than a year contrary to the provisions of the Act.The remaining 19 councillors elected the 2nd respondent as the President for the remaining period of thequadrennium.Immediately after that another meeting presided over by the newly elected President elected respondent No. 3 asVice- President. The same point of order raised by S as in the case of the President was overruled, on which 6councillors walked out and the meeting was held by the remaining councillors.

The notice to the councillors required under s. 35(3) of the Actsatisﬁed the requirements of three clear days, that the provisions of s.35(3) regarding the ser- 1270 vice of notice are directory and not mandatory; and that any omissions in the mannerof service of the notice are more irregularities which would not vitiate the proceedings unless it is shown thatthose irregularities had prejudicially aﬀected the proceedings which had not been alleged or proved in the presentcase. All the councillors constituting the Municipality were present on both the occasions namely the 30th July1954 and the 3rd August 1954 and thus had ample notice of the meeting to be held on the 3rd August 1954, thetime and place of the meeting and the business to be transacted. That under the provisions of s.35(3) of the Act the presence at or the absence from the meeting of the members of the public has no legalconsequence so far as the validity of the election is concerned;(2) that as s. 19 of the Bombay Boroughs Act, (Bombay Act XVIII of 1925) had been amended by the BombayMunicipal Boroughs Act, 1954 (Bombay Act LIV of 1954) and was retrospective in its operation, it had the eﬀect ofcuring any illegality or irregularity-in the election with reference to the provisions of S. 19 of the Act and thereforerespondents Nos. 2 and 3 had been validly elected as President and, Vice-President respectively.King v.

B. Kotwal, J. B. Dadachanji and Rajinder Narain, for the appellant.Naunit Lal, for respondents Nos. 1 to 3.1955. February 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA J.-This is an appeal by special leave againstthe judgment and order dated the 23rd August 1954 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, dismissing theappellant's petition for a writ of quo warranto or any other appropriate writ directed against the election of the2nd and 3rd respondents as President and Vice-President respectively of the Gadag-Betgeri 1271 The facts of thiscase are not in dispute and may shortly be stated as follows: The 1st respondent is a municipality governed by theprovisions of the Municipal Boroughs Act (Bombay Act XVIII of 1925) which 7 hereinafter shall be referred to as theAct for the sake of brevity. The appellant is one of the 32 councillors constituting the municipality. The last generalelection to the municipality took place on the 7th May 1951. The term of the councillors was three years computedfrom the date of the ﬁrst general meetinog held after the general election aforesaid-in this case the 10th July 1951.In that meeting the 4th and 5th respondents were elected President and Vice-President respectively of themunicipality for a term of three years.The Act was amended by Bombay Act XXXV of 1954, under which the term of oﬃce of the councillors wasextended from 3 to 4 years ending on the 9th July 1955. As the term of respondents 4 and 5 aforesaid was to expireat the end of three years from the 10th July 1951 and as the term of the municipality was extended by one yearunder the amending Act aforesaid, the vacancies thus occurring bad to be ﬁlled up by a fresh election of Presidentand Vice-President. The Collector therefore called a special general meeting of the municipality to be held on the30th July 1954 to elect a President and Vice-President for the remaining period of the quadrennium. The Collectorhad nominated the Prant Oﬃcer (the District Deputy Collector) to preside over that special general meeting. Onthe 30th July 1954 the Prant Oﬃcer under instructions from the Collector adjourned the meeting to the 3rd August1954 without transacting any business, the only item on the agenda being the election of the President and Vice-President. The 3rd respondent raised a point of order against the adjournment but the presiding oﬃcer aforesaidoverruled that objection. Hence the special general meeting was held on the 3rd August 1954. At that meeting theappellant raised a point of order that under the provisions of the "" Act a President could not be elected for 163 1272www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1955/6.html2/7 9/12/2020SHYABUDDINSAB MOHIDINSAB AKKI V. THE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGH & ORS [1955] INSC 6; AIR 1955 SC 31…a term less than a year and that therefore the proposed election would be in the teeth of those provisions. Thepresiding oﬃcer who was the same person who had adjourned the meeting on the 30th July 1954 overruled thatobjection too. Thereupon 13 out of the 32 councillors who were present walked out on the ground that they did notpropose to participate in a meeting in which the proposal was to elect a President for less than a year contrary tothe provisions of the Act. The appellant was one of those 13 councillors who walked out. It may be added that thefull strength of the municipality is 32 councillors all of whom were present both on the 30th July 1954 and the 3rdAugust 1954. The remaining 19 councillors proceeded to transact business and elected the 2nd respondent as thePresident, the proposal being that he ""should be President of the municipality for the remaining period of thequadrennium"" and that was the proposal which was carried. Immediately after the election of the Presidentanother meeting was held for the election of the Vice-President under the presidency of the newly electedPresident (the 2nd respondent). The appellant raised the same point of order as he had done in the case of theelection of the President and that was also overruled. Thereupon six of the councillors present including theappellant walked out and the remaining councillors elected the 3rd respondent as the Vice- President.The appellant moved the High Court of Bombay under art. 226 of the Constitution for a writ of quo warranto orany other appropriate writ or order or direction against the 2nd and 3rd respondents ""restraining them fromusurping the oﬃce of the President and Vice-President respectively of the opponent No. I Municipality andrestraining them from performing any duties and from exercising any powers as President and Vice-Presidentrespectively"". The High Court held that the election of the 2nd and 3rd respondents was not illegal and dismissedthe application. It held that on a proper construction of the relevant provisions of the Act it was not correct to saythat the term of oﬃce of the councillors or of the newly 1273 elected President and Vice-President shall end withthe 9th July 1955; that the intention was to elect the President and the Vice-President for the remaining term ofthe municipality which was not only a period of four years certain but an additional period up to 7 the date whennew President and Vice-President A would be elected and take over after a fresh general election; that theadjournment of the meeting of the 30th July was not beyond the powers of the presiding oﬃcer; and thatconsequently the meeting of the 3rd August was not vitiated by any illegality. It was also pointed out by the HighCourt that all the councillors constituting the municipality had notice of the adjourned meeting and did as a matterof fact attend that meeting and that even if there was any irregularity in the adjournment on the 30th July 1954that did not aﬀect the illegality of the adjourned meeting and the business transacted therein.The appellant moved the High Court for leave to appeal to this court but that application was rejected. Theappellant then applied to this court for special leave to appeal which was granted on the 3rd September 1954.It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the meeting held on 3rd August 1954 as aforesaid was invalid forthe reasons:1. that it was not an adjourned meeting inasmuch as the meeting of the 30th July 1954 had not been validlyadjourned,2. that it had not been called by the Collector, and3. that the written notice required by section 35(3) had not been given and in any event, had not been served andpublished as required by law.Secondly it was urged that the meeting of the 3rd August being thus invalid., the business transacted at thatmeeting, namely, the election of the President was equally invalid. Thirdly it was urged that the election of thePresident being invalid, the meeting held that very day under the presidency of the President thus elected wasalso invalid and the election of the Vice-President consequently was illegal. It was 1274 further argued that theelection of the President and the Vice-President being in violation of section 19 of the Act was invalid on thatground also; and ﬁnally, that the amendment of section 19 by the amending Act LIV of 1954 after leave to appealhad been granted by this court could not aﬀect the present proceedings which were then pending even though theamending Act purported to make it retrospective.On behalf of respondents 1, 2 and 3 who only have appeared in this court, it has been urged that a President andVice- President could be elected for a term of less than one year as section 19 of the Act was subject to section 23(1) (A);that in any view of the matter, section 19 as amended by the amending Act LIV of 1954 rendered the electionbeyond question as the Act in terms was meant to validate all elections held between the passing of the amendingwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1955/6.html3/7 9/12/2020SHYABUDDINSAB MOHIDINSAB AKKI V. THE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGH & ORS [1955] INSC 6; AIR 1955 SC 31…Act XXXV of 1954 and the amending Act LIV of 1954; that the presiding oﬃcer had inherent, if not statutory powerto adjourn the meeting of the 30th July 1954 and that in any event the meeting held on the 3rd August 1954 couldbe treated as a fresh meeting called by the Collector and that any irregularity in serving the notice or in theappointment of the presiding oﬃcer was cured by the provisions of section 57 of the Act. It was also argued thatthe appellant was not the councillor who had objected to the adjournment of the meeting of the 30th July andcould not therefore object to it at a later stage. Finally it was argued that the appellant had no right to a writ ororder prayed for as he had not been injured in any sense.It would thus appear that there are two main questions in controversy between the parties, namely, (1) whetherthe meeting of the 3rd August, 1954 had been validly held; and (2) whether the president and the vice-presidenthaving been elected ""for the remaining period of the quadrennium"" had been validly elected.There are a number of subsidiary questions bearing upon these two main questions which have been canvassedbefore us, 1275 A good deal of argument was addressed to us contending that the presiding oﬃcer had no powerto adjourn the meeting of the 30th July 1954 in view of the provisions of section 35(11) of the Act. In thisconnection reference was also made to the proviso to section 19-A(2). Those provisions, it was argued,, point tothe conclusion that the powers of the presiding oﬃcer are the same as those of the president of a municipalitywhen presiding over an ordinary meeting of the municipality except that section 35(11) relating to adjournmentshad been qualiﬁed only to this extent by the proviso aforesaid, that the Collector or the oﬃcer presiding over themeeting for the purpose of holding an election of the president or vice-president may refuse to adjourn such ameeting in spite of the wishes of the majority of the members present to the contrary. It was also argued that theHigh Court had wrongly taken the view that the presiding oﬃcer had the inherent right to adjourn the meeting.Reference was made to certain passages in ""The Law of Meetings"" by Head, ""The Law on the Practice of Meetings""by Shackleton, and ""Company Meetings"" by Talbot.In our opinion, it is unnecessary for the purpose of this case to pronounce upon the merits of that controversy inthe view we take of the meeting of the 3rd August, 1954, assuming that the meeting of the 30th July, 1954 hadbeen adjourned without authority.It is common ground that it was the Collector who called the meeting of the 30th July 1954 and that it was underinstructions from the Collector that meeting was adjourned.Under the provisions of section 23(1) (A), on the expiry of the term of oﬃce of the president or vice-president asdetermined by the municipality under section 19(1) of the Act, a new president or vice-president shall be electedwithin 25 days from the date of such expiry. The provisions of section 19-A which relate to the procedure for callinga meeting of a newly constituted municipality for the election of a president and vice-president have been madeapplicable to the calling of a meeting and the procedure to be followed at such meeting for the 1276 election of apresident. Section 19-A requires the Collector to call a meeting for holding such an election.Such a meeting shall be presided over by the Collector or such oﬃcer as the Collector may by order in writingappoint in this behalf. The Collector or his nominee, when presiding over such a meeting, shall have the samepowers as the president of a municipalit by when presiding over a meeting of the municipality has, but shall nothave the right to vote. On the 30th July, 1954 a special general meeting had been called by the Collector for theelection of the President. In the proceedings of that meeting it has been recorded that ""Under instructions fromthe Collector of Dharwar the presiding authority adjourns the meeting to 3rd August 1954 at 3 P.m."". At thatmeeting all the 32 councillors were present and admittedly in their presence the presiding oﬃcer declared openlythat the meeting will be held on the 3rd August 1954 under instructions from the Collector concerned. When themeeting was held on the 3rd August 1954 at 3 P.m. as previously notiﬁed, again the 32 councillors were present.The proceedings show that the same Prant Oﬃcer ""occupied the chair as authorised by the Collector"". Thepresiding authority read out and explained to the members present the following telegraphic message from theCollector:""Government have directed to bold election of President of Gadag Municipality on 3rd August as already arranged.Hold election accordingly today without fail"".At this meeting the appellant raised two points of order, (1) that the election of the president for the remainingperiod of the quadrennium as mentioned in the agenda was illegal, and (2) that the meeting was not an adjournedmeeting of the municipality and was also illegal because it -was under the instructions of the Collector that theadjourned meeting was being held and that the Collector had no such power. The minutes of the proceedingswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1955/6.html4/7 9/12/2020SHYABUDDINSAB MOHIDINSAB AKKI V. THE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGH & ORS [1955] INSC 6; AIR 1955 SC 31…further show that ""the presiding authority ruled out the points of order on the ground that this was a specialmeeting called by the Collector for the election of the President and 1277 the election has to be held as alreadyﬁxed"". After the ruling given by the presiding authority, 13 members including the appellant expressed a desire towalk out and walked out with the permission of the presiding authority.The remaining members, as already indicated, continued the business of the meeting and the proposal that the2nd respondent should be elected president of the municipality for the remaining period of the quadrennium afterhaving been duly made and seconded was carried unanimously and the meeting terminated.It would thus appear that the meeting of the 3rd August 1954 for the election of the president had been called bythe Collector who had authorized the Prant Oﬃcer to preside over that meeting and that the 2nd respondent wasduly elected president. Under section 35(3) of the Act, for such a special general meeting three clear days' noticehas to be given ""specifying the time and place at -which such meeting is to be held and the business to betransacted thereat shall be served upon the councillors, and posted up at the municipal oﬃce or the kacheri orsome other public building in the municipal borough and also published in a local vernacular newspaper having alarge circulation if such exists"".It has been contended on behalf of the appellant that the notice required by section 35 (3) contemplates a writtennotice to be served and published in the manner speciﬁed, and that the meeting of the 3rd August 1954 could notbe said to have been held after complying with the terms of sub-section (3) of section 35. It was also contendedthat the requirements of section 19-A(1) and (2) have also not been complied with because there is no evidencethat the Collector had called that meeting or that he had made an order in writing that the presiding authority hadbeen authorized to preside over that meeting. In our opinion, there is no substance in any one of thesecontentions. From the record of the proceedings of the proposed meeting of the 30th July 1954 and the actualmeeting on the 3rd August 1954 it is clear that whatever had been done had been done under the orders of 1278the Collector. He had called the meeting of the 30th July as also of the 3rd August 1954. It was he who hadappointed the Prant Oﬃcer as the presiding oﬃcer for both those meetings. It is true that the notice of themeeting of the 3rd August 1954 had not been given in writing but had only been intimated to all the councillorswho were present at the meeting of the 30th July 1954. The notice amply satisﬁes the requirement of three days'clear notice, though it was not in writing. It had indicated the time of the meeting and the business to betransacted. Under section 35(4) the ordinary venue of a meeting is the municipal oﬃce unless otherwise indicatedin the notice.It is also true that the notice was not served in the manner indicated in sub-section (3) of section 35 of the Act.There is no evidence that there existed a local vernacular newspaper with large circulation, in which the notice ofthe meeting could be published. The question is, do those omissions render the notice ineﬀective in law. Thatcould only be so if those provisions were held to be mandatory.The following provisions (omitting the words not material to this case) would show that those provisions of section35(3) are directory and not mandatory and that any omissions in the manner of service of the notice are mereirregularities which would not vitiate the proceedings unless it was shown that those irregularities bad prejudiciallyaﬀected the proceedings:- ""No resolution of a municipality deemed invalid on account of any irregularity in theservice of notice upon any councillor or member provided that the proceedings of the municipality ................ werenot prejudicially aﬀected by such irregularity"".Fortunately for the respondents, all the councillors constituting the municipality were present on both theoccasions, namely, 30th July and 3rd August, 1954. Hence they had ample notice of the meeting to be held on the3rd August, 1954, the time and place of the meeting and the business to be transacted. It has not been eitheralleged or proved that the irregularities in the service of the notice or the omissions com- 1279 plained of hadprejudicially aﬀected the proceedings. But it was contended that as the notice had not been posted up at themunicipal oﬃce or the local kacheri or some other public building and had also not been published in a localvernacular newspaper, if there were one, though all the councillors were present on 3rd August, 1954, themembers of the public had no such notice and naturally therefore could not be present at that meeting. In thisconnection it was pointed out that sub-section (6) of section 35 provides that every such meeting shall be open tothe public, unless the presiding authority directs to the contrary. It is evident from the provisions of that sub-section that though the presence of the public at such meetings may be desirable, it is not obligatory. Thepresence at or the absence from such a meeting of the members of the public has no legal consequence so far asthe validity of the election is concerned. It must therefore be held that the meeting of the 3rd August, 1954 inwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1955/6.html5/7 9/12/2020SHYABUDDINSAB MOHIDINSAB AKKI V. THE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGH & ORS [1955] INSC 6; AIR 1955 SC 31…substance, though not in form, complied with the requirements of the law for holding a valid special generalmeeting and that therefore that meeting was not invalid, assuming, as already said, that the order of the presidingauthority adjourning the meeting of the 30th July, 1954 was not authorized. It has to be remembered in thisconnection that such a special general meeting can be presided over only by the Collector or the personauthorized by him and if either the Collector or his nominee does not hold the meeting, it is not competent forcouncillors present to elect their own chairman for presiding over such a meeting. Therefore if the presidingauthority admittedly under instructions from the Collector refused to proceed with the elections on the 30th July1954, the councillors present could not hold a meeting of their own with a president of their own choice andtransact the only business on the agenda, namely, the election of president. Hence, rightly or wrongly, if themeeting called for the 30th July was not held, another meeting had to be held for the purpose within 25 days of theoccurrence of the vacancy. In this case, as a 164 1280 result of the expiry of the original term of oﬃce of thepresident and vice-president, another meeting giving the required three days statutory notice had to be held. Themeeting held on the 3rd August 1954 was such a meeting.Indeed, there were some omissions in the manner of publication or service of the notice but those in law weremere irregularities which do not have the eﬀect of vitiating the election held at that meeting. The election of thepresident therefore, if not otherwise invalid, could not be assailed on the ground of the irregularity in the service orpublication of the notice, in the special circum- stances of this case. If all the councillors had not been present onthe 30th July or had not been informed of the proposed meeting of the 3rd August 1954, other considerations mayhave arisen but in this case it is clear that there was absolutely no prejudice to any party or individual or themunicipality as a whole. But it was further contended that the walking out of the 13 councillors rendered themeeting infructuous. In our opinion, such a result does not follow from the voluntary act of the 13 councillors whochose to walk out. It was not even suggested that there was no quorum for the special general meeting after the 13councillors walked out.The next question is whether the provisions of section 19 (1) as they stood on the 3rd August 1954 render theelection of the president and the vice-president on the 3rd August 1954 invalid as it was ""for the remaining periodof the quadrennium"". The High Court has taken the view that the remaining period of the quadrennium would notnecessarily end on the 9th July 1955, in view of the proviso to section 19(1) ""that the term of oﬃce of suchpresident or vice- president shall be deemed to extend to and expire with the date on which his successor iselected"". In view of the events that have happened it is not necessary for us to pronounce on the correctness orotherwise of that decision.After the judgment of the High Court and after the grant of special leave by this court, the Bombay Legislatureenacted Act LIV of 1954 which was published in the Bombay Gazette on the 14th 1281 October 1954. Sections 2and 3 of the amending Act are in these terms:""2. In section 19 of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925, in sub-section (I),- (1)after the words 'not less thanone year' the words 'or not less than the residue of the term of oﬃce of the municipality, whichever is less' shall beinserted;(2)for the words 'three years' the words 'four years' shall be substituted.3.(1) The amendments made by this Act shall be deemed to have come into force on the date on which theBombay District Muncipal and Municipal Boroughs (Amendment) Act, 1954, came into force (hereinafter in thissection referred to as 'the said date') and all elections to the oﬃce of the president or vice-president, held on orafter the said date and before the coming into force of this Act, shall be deemed to be valid as if this Act bad beenin force on the said date; and any person elected to the oﬃce of the president or vice-president at any of suchelections shall not be deemed to have been illegally elected merely on the ground that the residue of the term ofoﬃce of the municipality being less than one year at the time of such election, he would hold his oﬃce for a termless than one year in contravention of section 19 of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925, as it was inoperation before the coming into force of this Act.(2)Nothing contained in this section shall aﬀect the judgment, decree or order of any competent court, passedbefore the coming into force of this Act, holding any of such elections invalid on the ground speciﬁed in sub-section (1)"".It has not been contended that section 19 as amended by Act LIV of 1954 does not in terms cover the electionsnow impugned, nor that section 3 of the amending Act quoted above is not retrospective; but it has been urged onwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/1955/6.html6/7 9/12/2020SHYABUDDINSAB MOHIDINSAB AKKI V. THE GADAG-BETGERI MUNICIPAL BOROUGH & ORS [1955] INSC 6; AIR 1955 SC 31…behalf of the appellant that it is not retrospective to the extent of aﬀecting pending proceedings. In terms theamendment in question is deemed to have come into force on the II the May 1954 1282 on which date theamending Act XXXV of 1954 had come into force. Section 3 in terms also declares that all elections to the oﬃce ofpresident and vice-president held on or after the 11th May 1954 and before the coming into force of the amendingAct shall be deemed to have been valid. The section also declares in unequivocal terms that such an election shallnot be questioned simply on the ground of contravention of section 19 on which the election of the 2nd and 3rdrespondents bad been questioned before the High Court. The legislature apparently thought ﬁt to declare beyondall controversy that an election of president or vice-president for the unexpired portion of the term of amunicipality could not be questioned on the ground that the provisions of section 19 as it stood before theamendment had been contravened.But it was argued on behalf of the appellant that in terms the amendment hadnot been made applicable to pending litigation and that therefore this court should hold that the amendment didnot have the eﬀect of validating the elections which were already under challenge in a court. No authority hasbeen cited before us in support of the contention that unless there are express words in the amending statute tothe eﬀect that the amendment shall apply to pending proceedings also, it cannot aﬀect such proceedings. There isclear authority to the contrary in-the following dictum of Lord Reading, C.J. in the case of The King v. The GeneralCommissioners of Income- tax for Southampton; Ex parte W. M. Singer (1),- ""I cannot accept the contention of theapplicant that an enactment can only take away vested rights of action for which legal proceedings have beencommenced if there are in the enactment express words to that eﬀect. There is no authority for this proposition,and I do not see why in principle it should be the law. But it is necessary that clear language should be used tomake the retrospective eﬀect applicable to proceedings commenced before the passing of the statute"".That was a case in which the Act in question had (1) [ 1916] 2 K.B. 249, 259, 1283 validated assessments made bycommissioners for wrong parishes. It was held by the court that the retrospective eﬀect of the relevant sectionextended to proceedings for a prohibition commenced before the Act came into force and the rule nisi for aprohibition was therefore discharged. In every case the language of the amending statute has to be examined toﬁnd out whether the legislature clearly intended even pending proceedings to be aﬀected by such statute. Anumber of authorities were cited before us but it is only necessary to refer to the decision of their Lord- ships ofthe Judicial Committee in Mukerjee, Oﬃcial Receiver v. Ramratan Kuer(1), which is clearly in point. In that casewhile an appeal had been pending before the Judicial Committee the amending Act had been passed clearlyshowing that the Act was retrospective in the sense that it applied to all cases of a particular description, withoutreference to pending litigation. In those circumstances their Lordships pointed out that if any saving were to beimplied in favour of pending proceedings, then the provisions of the statute would largely be rendered nugatory.Those observations apply with full force to the present case, inasmuch as if any saving were to be implied in favourof cases pending on the date of the amendment, the words ""all elections to the oﬃce of the president or vice-president, held on or after the said date and before the coming into force of this Act, shall be deemed to be valid""could not be given their full eﬀect. As there are no such saving clauses in express or implied terms, it must be heldthat the amendment was clearly intended by the legislature to apply to all cases of election of president or vice-president, whether or not the matter had been taken to court. it is the duty of courts to give full eﬀect to theintentions of the legislature as expressed in a statute.That being so, it must be held that the amending Act had the eﬀect of curing any illegality or irregularity in theelections in question with reference to the provisions of section 19 of the Act.For the reasons aforesaid it must be held that the (1) [ 1935] L.R. 63 I.A. 47.1284 meeting of the 3rd August 1954 had been validly held and that there is no illegality in the election of the 2ndand 3rd respondents as president and vice-president respectively. We accordingly aﬃrm the orders of the HighCourt, though not for the same reasons. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed."

C. Setalvad, Attorney-General of India (B. Sen, and I.N. Shroﬀ, for P. K. Bose, with him) for the respondents.1955. February 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-The petitioner, Hans Muller, who is not acitizen of India, and who is said to be a West German subject, was arrested by the Calcutta Police on the 18thSeptember, 1954 and was placed under preventive detention. The order was made by the West BengalGovernment under section 3(1) of the Preventive Detention Act of 1950 (Act IV of 1950) on the ground that hisdetention was "" with a view to making arrangements for his explusion from India"".The grounds were served on the 22nd of September, 1954. The second ground runs- "" That you are a foreignerwithin the meaning of the Foreigners Act, 1946 (Act XXXI of 1946) and that it has become necessary to makearrangements for your expulsion from India and for this purpose you are required to be detained under section 3(1) (b) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 until the issue of an appropriate order of expulsion from the CentralGovernment"".On the day after his arrest, namely on the 19th September, 1954 he wrote to the Consul-General of West Germanyat Calcutta saying that be had been arrested and- asking for an early interview.

When the West German Consul got the passport he made the following entry on it:"" Valid only for the return voyage to the Federal Republic of Germany until the 8th January 1955"".The petitioner complains that this invalidated all the other visas and as, according to this fresh entry, the passportceased to be valid after the 8th of January 1955, he now has no passport.On the same day, the 9th of October 1954, the West German Government wrote to the West Bengal Governmentsaying that a warrant of arrest was issued against the petitioner in West Germany in connection with a number offrauds and that legal proceedings in connection with those warrants are still pending. The Consul also said that hehad received information that similar charges had been made against the petitioner in Lebanon and in Egypt andbe concluded- "" The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will apply for Muller' s extradition throughdiplomatic channels whilst at the same time submitting the supporting documents.As this will require a certain amount of time, I am directed to give you advance information of this step and herebyrequest the Government of West Bengal to issue a provisional warrant of arrest which ensures Muller' s detentionup to the date of his extradition to Germany.This Consulate has already arranged for Muller' s repatriation by the German boat ' KANDELFELS' due to arrive inCalcutta on the 19th instant.

We must issue orderof his release as soon as his boat is ready to sail"".The West Bengal Government had no power to deport the petitioner. Only the Central Government could do that,and up till the 20th of October the Central Government had not passed any orders. On that date the petitionerapplied to the High Court of Calcutta for a writ in the nature of habeas corpus under section 491 of the CriminalProcedure Code. Because of that, and because this matter has been pending in the courts ever since, no ordershave yet been issued for his expulsion from India though we are told by the learned Attorney-General that theyhave been made and signed but are being held in abeyance pending the decision of this petition.The petitioner contended that his detention was invalid for the following, among other, reasons:(1) Because section 3(1)(b) of the Preventive Detention Act, the section under which the order was. made, is ultravires the Constitution on three grounds- (a) that it contravenes articles 21 and 22;(b) that it contravenes article 14, and (c) that it was beyond the legislative competence of Parliament to enact sucha law;(2) Because section 3(1) (b) is not a law of preventive detention within the meaning of article 22(3) and therefore itcontravenes article 22 (1) and (2); and (3) Because, in any event, the order was made in bad faith.The High Court decided against the petitioner on all points and dismissed the petition on 10-12-1954. Hethereupon made the present petition to this Court on the same grounds, presumably under article 32 of theConstitution. It was ﬁled oil 10-1-1955.1289 We will ﬁrst consider the vires of section 3(1) (b). It is in these terms:"" The Central Government or the State Government may ...............(b) if satisﬁed with respect to any person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the Foreigners Act, 1946 (XXXIof 1946), that with a view to regulating his continued presence in India or with a view to making arrangements forhis expulsion from India, it is necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained"".The detention order is by a State Government and not by the Centre. The portion of the section on which the orderis based is the part that gives a State Government power to make an order of detention against a foreigner, onsatisfaction, "" with a view to making arrangements for his expulsion from India"".www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 7.html/02095959539"" 9/12/2HANS MULLER OF NURENBURG V. SUPERINTENDENT, PRESIDENCY JAIL, CALCUTTA & ORS [15] INSC 7; AIR 15 S C 3…The competence of the Central Legislature to enact a law dealing with this aspect of preventive detention isderived from Entry 9 of the Union List read with Entry 10, The portion of Entry 9 which concerns us is as follows:"" Preventive detention for reasons connected with Foreign Aﬀairs The scope of the expression "" Foreign Aﬀairs""indicated in Entry 10: is"" Foreign Aﬀairs; all matters which bring the Union into relation with any foreign country"".It is well settled that the language of these Entries must be given the widest scope of which their meaning is fairlycapable because they set up a machinery of Government and are not mere Acts of a legislature subordinate to theConstitution. Giving Entry 9 its widest range we ﬁnd it impossible to hold that legislation that deals with the rightof a State to keep foreigners under preventive detention without trial does not bring the Union into relation with aforeign country. Every country claims the right to the allegiance of its subjects wherever they may be and in returnguarantees to them the right of diplomatic 1290 protection when abroad. It is therefore the privilege, and theanxiety, of every civilised nation to keep vigilant watch over its subjects abroad and to ensure for them, as far asthat is possible through diplomatic channels, fair play and justice administered along lines of what is called,broadly for want of a better term, natural justice. A foreign State has a very direct interest in what is done to itssubjects in a foreign land. Therefore, legislation that confers jurisdiction upon Governments in this country todeprive foreigners of their liberty cannot but be a matter that will bring the Union into relation with foreign States,particularly when there is no public hearing and no trial in the ordinary courts of the land. But in this particularcase, the relation is even more direct, for the provision here is for detention with a view to making arrangementsfor a foreigner' s expulsion from India. A foreign State has a very deep interest in knowing where and how itssubjects can be forcibly expelled against their will. The legislative competence of Parliament to deal with thisquestion is, we think, clear; and this covers not only section 3(1) (b) of the Preventive Detention Act but also theForeigners Act, 1946 (Act XXXI of 1946) in so far as it deals with the powers of expulsion and the right of theCentral Government to restrict the movements of foreigners in India and prescribe the place of their residence andthe ambit of their movements in the land.The learned Attorney-General sought to base the legislative competence upon other Entries as well and claimedthat Parliament is not conﬁned to Entry 9 in List I and Entry 3 in List III (the only Entries that touch directly onpreventive detention). He claimed, for example, that laws for the preventive detention of foreigners can also bebased upon Entry 17 in List I which relates to aliens and Entry 19 which relates to expulsion from India; and alsoupon the portions of Entries 9 in List I and 3 in List III that deal with the "" security of India"" and the "" security of theState"" and the "" maintenance of public order"", provided always that they comply with articles 21 and 22 of theConstitution, We express no opinion 1291 about this as we can uphold the portion of the Statute that is impugnedhere on the narrower ground we have set out above.The next question is whether the limitations imposed on this power by articles 21 and 22 have been observed.Article 21 guarantees the protection of personal liberty to citizen and foreigner alike. No person can be deprived ofhis personal liberty "" except according to procedure established by law"", and article 22 prescribes the minimumthat the procedure established by law must provide. There can be no arrest or detention without the person beingproduced before the nearest magistrate within twenty four hours, excluding the time necessary for the journey,etc., nor can he be detained beyond that period without the authority of a magistrate.The only exceptions are (1) enemy aliens and (2) "" any person who is arrested or detained under any law providingfor preventive detention"".There are further limitations, but they were not invoked except that the learned Attorney-General explained thatthe unrestricted power given by section 4(1) of the Foreigners Act, 1946 (a pre-constitution measure) to conﬁneand detain foreigners became invalid on the passing of the Constitution because of articles 21 and 22. Therefore,to bring this part of the law into line with the Constitution, section 3 (1) (b) of the Preventive Detention Act wasenacted. It was more convenient to insert new provisions about the conﬁnement and detention of foreigners in thePreventive Detention Act rather than amend the Foreigners Act because the Preventive Detention Act was acomprehensive Act dealing with preventive detention and was framed with the limitations of articles 21 and 22 inview.It was urged on behalf of the petitioner that section 3(1)(b) of the Preventive Detention Act is' -not reasonablyrelated to the purpose of the Act, namely, "" preventive detention"". It was argued that preventive detention can onlywww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 7.html/02095959549 9/12/2HANS MULLER OF NURENBURG V. SUPERINTENDENT, PRESIDENCY JAIL, CALCUTTA & ORS [15] INSC 7; AIR 15 S C 3…be for the purpose of prevent- 1292 ing something and when you seek to make arrangements for a man' sexpulsion from the country you are not preventing anything, or trying to, but are facilitating the performance of apositive act by the State, namely the act of expulsion.We do not agree and will ﬁrst examine the position where an order of expulsion is made before any steps toenforce it are taken. The right to expel is conferred by section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946 on the CentralGovernment and the right to enforce an order of expulsion and also to prevent any breach of it, and the right touse such force as may be reasonably necessary ""for the eﬀective exercise of such power"" is conferred by section11(1), also on the Central Government. There is, therefore, implicit in the right of expulsion a number of ancillaryrights, among them, the right to prevent any breach of the order and the right to use force and to take eﬀectivemeasures to carry out those purposes. Now the most eﬀective method of preventing a breach of the order andensuring that it is duly obeyed is by arresting and detaining the person ordered to be expelled until properarrangements for the expulsion can be made. Therefore, the right to make arrangements for an expulsion includesthe right to make arrangements for preventing any evasion or breach of the order, and the Preventive DetentionAct confers the power to use the means of preventive detention as one of the methods of achieving this end. Howfar it is necessary to take this step in a given case is a matter that must be left to the discretion of the Governmentconcerned, but, in any event, when criminal charges for oﬀences said to have been committed in this country andabroad are levelled against a person, an apprehension that he is likely to disappear and evade an order of expulsioncannot be called either unfounded or unreasonable. Detention in such circumstances is rightly termed preventiveand falls within the ambit of the Preventive Detention Act and is reasonably related to the purpose of the Act.The next question is whether any steps can be 1293 taken under the law in anticipation of an order that is about tobe made, or which may be made, by the competent authority on the recommendation of another authority seizedwith certain powers of Government and yet not competent to make an order of this kind.The Foreigners Act confers the right of expulsion on the Central Government. Therefore, a State Government hasno right either to make an order of expulsion or to expel. It was argued that if a State Government cannot expel ormake an order of expulsion, then it cannot be permitted to detain "" with a view to making arrangements for theexpulsion"". It was contended that the only authority that can make such arrangements, or direct that they shouldbe made, is the Central Government. It was also argued that until an order of expulsion is made by the properauthority, no one can start making arrangements for its due execution; the arrangements contemplated by section3(1)(b) must follow and not precede the order, especially as they involve curtail- ment of a man' s personal liberty,for the order may never be made and it would be wrong to permit an authority not authorised to decide thequestion to detain a man of its own motion till somebody else has time and leisure to consider the matter. Thatwould be inconsistent with the fundamental right to liberty guaranteed by the Constitution to citizen andforeigner alike.Again, we do not agree. The Preventive Detention Act expressly confers the right to detain ' -with a view tomaking, arrangements"" for the expulsion upon both the State and the Central Government and the "" satisfaction""required by section 3(1)(b) can be of either Government. The right to satisfy itself that the drastic method ofpreventive detention is necessary to enable suitable arrangements for expulsion to be made is therefore expresslyconferred on the State Government and as a State Government cannot expel, the conferral of the right can onlymean that the State Government is given the power to decide and to satisfy itself whether expulsion is desirable orneces- 1294 sary, and if it thinks it is, then to detain until proper arrangements for the expulsion are made, one ofthem, and an essential one, being reference to the Central Government for ﬁnal orders. It is evident that theauthorities must be vested with wide discretion in the present ﬁeld where international complications might easilyfollow in a given case. Unless a State Government has authority to act in anticipation of orders from the Centre, itmight be too late to act at all.We now turn to the argument that section 3 (1) (b) is ultra vires because it oﬀends article 14 of the Constitution.Actually, the attack here is on section 3 (2) (c) of the Foreigners Act but as section (3) (1) (b) of the PreventiveDetention Act is consequential on that it is also involved.Section 3(1)(b) permits detention of a ""foreigner"" with in the meaning of the Foreigners Act, 1946. The deﬁnitionof ""foreigner"" is given in section 2(a) of that Act and is as follows: `foreigner' means a person who- (i)is not a natural-born British subject as deﬁned in sub- sections (1) and (2) ofsection (1) of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, or (ii) has not been granted a certiﬁcate ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 7.html/02095959559"" 9/12/2HANS MULLER OF NURENBURG V. SUPERINTENDENT, PRESIDENCY JAIL, CALCUTTA & ORS [15] INSC 7; AIR 15 S C 3…naturalization as a British subject under any law for the time being in force in India"".The rest of the deﬁnition is not material. The argument is that this diﬀerentiates between foreigner and foreigner.It takes two classes of British subjects who are now as much foreigners as anyone else not an Indian citizen, out ofthe class of foreigners for the purposes of-preventive detention and for the purposes of expulsion under theForeigners Act.This, it was contended, oﬀends article 14 which provides that "" The State shall not deny to any person equalitybefore the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India"".This argument is easily answered by the classiﬁcation rule which has been repeatedly applied in this Court. Theclassiﬁcation of foreigners into those who are British subjects of the kind set out in the deﬁnition, and others, so asto make the former not 1295 foreigners for the purposes of the Foreigners Act and the Preventive Detention Act, isa reasonable and rational classiﬁcation and so does not, on the authority of our previous decisions, oﬀend article14. There is no individual discrimination and it is easily understandable that reasons of State may make it desirableto classify foreigners into diﬀerent groups. We repel this argument.It was then said that at any rate there is diﬀerentiation in the same group because the deﬁnition discriminatesbetween classes of British subjects inter se. It was pointed out that the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act,1914 was repealed in 1948 and re-enacted in another form but as our Act has retained the 1914 deﬁnition that isthe one we must consider. We do not intend to examine this contention because, even if it be true that there is thediscrimination alleged, namely between one class of British subject and another, that will not give the petitioner aright of challenge on this ground. He is not a British subject and so is not a member of the only class that couldclaim to be aggrieved on this score. This Court has decided in earlier cases that the only persons who can impugnany given piece of legislation under article 32 are those who are aggrieved thereby. As the petitioner is not aperson aggrieved, so far as this point is concerned, he not being a British subject, he cannot attack the section onthis ground.We hold that the impugned portions of section 3(1)(b) of the Preventive Detention Act and section 3(2)(c) of theForeigners Act, 1946 are intra vires.We now turn to a wider question that brings us to the fringe of International law. It arises in this way. The goodfaith of the Government of the State of West Bengal in making the order of detention was challenged on thefollowing, among other, grounds. It was argued that the real object of Government in continuing the detentionwas to keep the petitioner in custody so that it would be in a position to hand him over to the West Germanauthorities as soon as a suitable German boat arrived. It will be remembered 166 1296 that the West GermanGovernment wants the petitioner for oﬀences which he is alleged to have committed in West Germany and thatthe West German Consul at Calcutta wrote to the West Bengal Government on 9-10-1954 asking that Governmentto issue a provisional warrant of arrest against the petitioner and to keep him in custody until the West GermanGovernment could initiate extradition proceedings against him, and added that the West German Consulate atCalcutta had already arranged for his repatriation on a German boat that was to arrive on the 19th of October1954.On receipt of this letter, the Secretary of the West Bengal Government recorded a note saying that he supposedthere would be no objection to the West Bengal Government keeping the petitioner in detention till the 19th. Itwas said that the connection between the letter, the expected arrival of the boat on the 19th and the Secretary' sproposal to keep the petitioner till that date, was obvious.The attack on the good faith of the West Bengal Government at this point was two-fold. First, it was said thatwhatever the original intention of the West Bengal Government may have been, when the West German Consul' sletter was received, the object of the detention was no longer for the purpose of making arrangements for thepetitioner' s expulsion but for keeping him in custody till the West German Government was in a position tocommence extradition proceedings; that, it was said, was an abuse of the Preventive Detention Act and was notjustiﬁed by any of its provisions.The second ground of attack was that, if that was not the object, then, very clearly, the idea was to hand thepetitioner over to the German authorities on a German boat without the formality of extradition proceedings andwithout giving the petitioner a chance to defend himself and show that be could not be extradited. That, it wassaid, made the matter worse than ever. It was denied that the petitioner had committed any oﬀence in Westwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 7.html/02095959569 9/12/2HANS MULLER OF NURENBURG V. SUPERINTENDENT, PRESIDENCY JAIL, CALCUTTA & ORS [15] INSC 7; AIR 15 S C 3…Germany or any- where else. He claimed to be a communist and said that the real object of the West GermanGovernment 1297 was to subject him to political persecution the moment they could lay bands on him. Thecontention was that once an order of extradition is asked for, a foreigner cannot be handed over to theGovernment seeking his extradition except under the Extradition Act.The learned Attorney-General contended very Cc strongly that this question was academic and should not beconsidered because no order of expulsion had yet been served on the petitioner and no one knows the terms ofthe order. We do not think it is in view of what the learned Attorney-General told us, namely that an order ofexpulsion has actually been made and signed but is kept in abeyance pending our deci- sion.We see no force in the ﬁrst part of the petitioner' s argument. We are at bottom considering the question of theWest Bengal Government' s good faith. The order of detention was made before the West German Consul wrotehis letter, so there was no connection between that letter and the order.After that there is no material to indicate that the West Bengal Government changed its mind and continued thedeten- tion for another purpose. The note referred to is the note of a Secretary to Government and embodies hissuggestion about what should be done. It cannot be used either as an order of Government itself or as anindication of its mind.The second point raises a question of wider import touching the status and rights of foreigners in India, and thequestion we have to determine is whether there is any law in India vesting the executive government with powerto expel a foreigner from this land as opposed to extraditing him.Article 19 of the Constitution confers certain fundamental rights of freedom on the citizens of India, among them,the right ""to move freely throughout the territory of India"" and ""to reside and settle in any part of India "", subjectonly to laws that impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of those rights in the interests of the generalpublic or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. No cor- 1298 responding rights are given toforeigners. All that is guaranteed to them is protection to life and liberty in accordance with the laws of the land.This is conferred by article 21 which is in the following terms:"" No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law "".Entries 9, 10) 17, 18 and 19 in the Union List confer wide powers on the Centre to make laws about among otherthings, admission into and expulsion from India, about extradition and aliens and about preventive detentionconnected with foreign aﬀairs. Therefore, the right to make laws about the extradition of aliens and about theirexpulsion from the land is expressly conferred; also, it is to be observed that extradition and expulsion arecontained in separate, entries indicating that though they may overlap in certain aspects, they are diﬀerent anddistinct subjects. And that brings us to the Foreigners Act which deals, among other things, with expulsion, andthe Extradition Act which regulates extradition.The Foreigners Act confers the power to expel foreigners from India. It vests the Central Government withabsolute and unfettered discretion and, as there is no provision fettering this discretion in the Constitution, anunrestricted right to expel remains.The law of extradition is quite diﬀerent. Because of treaty obligations it confers a right on certain countries (not all)to ask that persons who are alleged to have committed certain speciﬁed oﬀences in their territories, or who havealready been convicted of those oﬀences by their courts, be handed over to them in custody for prosecution orpunishment. But despite that the Government of India is not bound to comply with the request and has anabsolute and unfettered discretion to refuse.There are important diﬀerences between the two Acts. In the ﬁrst place, the Extradition Act applies to everybody,citizen and foreigner alike, and to every class of foreigner, that is to say, even to foreigners who are not nationalsof the country asking for 1299 extradition. But, as has been seen, because of article 19 no citizen can be expelled(as opposed to extradition) in the absence of a speciﬁc law to that eﬀect; and there is none; also, the kind of lawtouching expulsion (as opposed to extradition) that could be made in the case of a citizen would have to berestricted in scope. That is not the case where a foreigner is concerned because article 19 does not apply. But acitizen who has committed certain kinds of oﬀences abroad can be extradited if the formalities prescribed by theExtradition Act are observed. A foreigner has no such right and he can be expelled without any formality beyondthe making of an order by the Central Government. But if he is extradited instead of being expelled, then thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 7.html/02095959579 9/12/2HANS MULLER OF NURENBURG V. SUPERINTENDENT, PRESIDENCY JAIL, CALCUTTA & ORS [15] INSC 7; AIR 15 S C 3…formalities of the Extradition Act must be complied with. The importance of the distinction will be realised fromwhat follows; and that applies to citizen and foreigner alike.The Extradition Act is really a special branch of the law of Criminal Procedure. It deals with criminals and thoseaccused of certain crimes. The Foreigners Act is not directly concerned with criminals or crime though the fact thata foreigner has committed oﬀences, or is suspected of that, may be a good ground for regarding him asundesirable.Therefore, under the Extradition Act warrants or a summons must be issued; there must be a magisterial enquiryand when there is an arrest it is penal in character; and-and this is the most important distinction of all-when theperson to be extradited leaves India he does not leave the country a free man. The police in India hand him over tothe police of the requisitioning State and he remains in custody throughout.In the case of expulsion, no idea of punishment is involved, at any rate, in theory, and if a man is prepared to leavevoluntarily he can ordinarily go as and when he pleases.But the right is not his. Under the Indian law, the matter is left to the unfettered discretion of the UnionGovernment and that Government can prescribe the route and the port or place of departure and can place him ona particular ship or plane. (See sections 3(2) (b) and 6 of the Foreigners 1300 Act). Whether the Captain of a foreignship or plane can be compelled to take a passenger he does not want or to follow a particular route is a matter thatdoes not arise and we express no opinion on it. But assuming that he is willing to do so, the right of theGovernment to make the order vis- a-vis the man expelled is absolute.This may not be the law in all countries. Oppenheim, for example, says that in England, until December 1919, theBritish Government bad "" no power to expel even the most dangerous alien without the recommendation of acourt, or without an Act of Parliament making provision for ' such expulsion, except during war or on an occasion ofimminent national danger or great emergency"". (Oppenheim' s International Law, Vol. 1, 7th edition, page 631).But that is immaterial, for the law in each country is diﬀerent and we are concerned with the law as it obtains inour land. Here the matter of expulsion has to be viewed from three points of view: (1) does the Constitution permitthe making of such a law? (2) does it place any limits on such laws? and (3) is there in fact any law on this topic inIndia and if so, what does it enact? We have already examined the law making power in this behalf and its scope,and as to the third question the law on this matter in India is embodied in the Foreigners Act which gives anunfettered right to the Union Government to expel. But there is this distinction. If the order is one of expulsion, asopposed to extradition, then the person expelled leaves India a free man. It is true he may be apprehended themoment he leaves, by some other power and consequently, in some cases this would be small consolation to him,but in most cases the distinction is substantial, for the right of a foreign power to arrest except in its own territoryand on its own boats is not unlimited. But however that may be, so far as India is concerned, there must be anorder of release if he is in preventive custody and though he may be conducted to the frontier under detention hemust be permitted to leave a free man 1301 and cannot be handed over under arrest.In a case of extradition, he does not leave a free man. He remains under arrest throughout and is merely handedover by one set of police to the next. But in that event, the formalities of the Extradition Act must be compliedwith.There must be a magisterial enquiry with a regular hearing and the person C sought to be extradited must beaﬀorded the right to submit a written statement to the Central Government and to ask, if he so chooses, forpolitical asy- lum; also be has the right to defend himself and the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legalpractitioner of his choice. (Article 22(1) Of course, he can also make a representation against an order of expulsionand ask for political asylum apart from any Act but those are not matters of right as under the Extradition Act.Our conclusion is that the Foreigners Act is not governed by the provisions of the Extradition Act. The two aredistinct and neither impinges on the other. Even if there is a requisition and a good case for extradition,Government is not bound to accede to the request. It is given an unfettered right to refuse. Section 3(1) of theExtradition Act says- ""the Central Government may, if it thinks ﬁt"".Therefore, if it chooses not to comply with the request, the person against whom the request is made cannot insistthat it should. The right is not his; and the fact that a request has been made does not fetter the discretion ofGovernment to choose the less cumbrous procedure of the Foreigners Act when a foreigner is concerned, providedalways, that in that event the person concerned leaves India a free man. If no choice had been left to thewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 7.html/02095959589 9/12/2HANS MULLER OF NURENBURG V.

This line ofattack oil the good faith of Government falls to the ground.The remaining grounds about want of good faith 1302 that were raised in the petition were not seriously pressedand as they are of no substance we need not discuss them.The petition fails and is dismissed.Petition dismissed."

NUSSERWANJI RATTANJI MISTRI & ORS [1955] INSC 8; AIR 1955 SC 298; 1955 (1) SCR 1311 (28 February 1955).pdf,"In the island of Bombay certain lands were held on a tenure known as ""Foras"". Under s. 2 of Bombay Act VI of 1851the occupants were entitled to hold the lands subject only to the payment of revenue then payable. Between 1864and 1867 the Government of India acquired these lands under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act (VI of1857). On 22- 11-1938 the Governor-General sold them to certain persons under whom the present respondentsclaimed. In April 1942 the appellant acting under the Bombay City Land Revenue Act (Bombay Act II of 1876)issued notices to the respondents proposing to levy assessment on the lands at the rates mentioned therein. Therespondents thereupon instituted two suits disputing the right of the appellant to assess the lands to revenue.They contended that under the Foras Land Act the occupants had acquired the right to hold the lands on paymentof revenue not exceeding what was then payable, that the right to levy even that assessment was extinguishedwhen the Government acquired the lands under the Land Acquisition Act, that the Governor-General havingconveyed the lands absolutely under the sale deed dated 22-11-1938 the respondents were entitled to hold themrevenue-free and that even if revenue was payable it could not exceed what was payable under the Foras LandAct.Held, (i) that under the Foras Land Act (VI of 1851) the occupants of Foras lands acquired a speciﬁc right to holdthem on payment of assessment not exceeding what was then payable.(ii) that the right of the Government to levy assessment was not the subject-matter of the land acquisitionproceedings and that the eﬀect of those proceedings was only to extinguish the rights of the occupants in thelands and to vest them absolutely in the Government.(iii) that where there is an absolute sale by the Crown it does not necessarily import that the land is conveyedrevenuefree.The question is one of construction of the grant. The rule is that a grantee from the Crown gets only what isgranted by the 168 1312 deed and nothing passes by implication. When the grant is embodied in a deed thequestion ultimately reduces itself to a determination of what was granted thereunder.

Whatthese rights are, is a matter in controversy between the parties, and will be presently considered. Between 1864and 1867 the Government acquired these lands for the purpose of the B.B. C.I. Railway under the provisions ofLand Acquisition Act No. VI of 1857. On 22-11-1938 these lands, being no longer required for the purpose of theRailway, were sold by the Governor-General to Lady Pochkhanawalla and others as joint tenants under a deed,Exhibit A. On 28-3-1939 the survivor of the purchasers under Exhibit A conveyed the lands in trust under Exhibit B,and the respondents are the trustees appointed under that deed.In April 1942 the appellant acting under the provisions of Bombay Act No. II of 1876, issued notices to therespondents proposing to levy assessment on the lands at the rates mentioned therein, and calling for theirrepresentation. In their reply, the respondents denied the right of the appellant to assess the lands to revenue, andfollowed it up by instituting two suits before the Revenue Judge for establishing their rights. In their plaints, theyalleged that under the provisions of the Foras Act the maximum assessment leviable on the lands was 9 reas perburga, and that the Government had no right to enhance it; that the eﬀect of the land acquisition proceedingsbetween 1864 and 1867 was to extinguish the right of the State to levy even this assessment, and that further,having purchased the properties absolutely from the Governor-General under Exhibit A. they were entitled to boldthem without any liability to pay revenue thereon. They accordingly prayed for a declaration that the Governmenthad no right to levy any assessment on these lands, or, in the alternative, that such assessment should not exceedwhat was payable under Bombay Act No. VI of 1851. The appellant contested the suit. The Revenue Judge heldthat as a result of the land acquisition proceedings between 1864 and 1867, the lands vested in the Governmentfreed from any liability to pay assessment, and that when the Governor-General transferred them under 1314Exhibit A without reserving the right to assess them, the purchasers had the right to hold them without anyliability to pay revenue. He accordingly granted a declaration that the appellant had no right to levy assessment,and -that the notices issued by him under Act No. II of 1876 were illegal.On appeal by the defendants to the High Court of Bombay, it was held by Chagla, C.J., Bhagwati, J. concurring,that Act No. VI of 1851 imposed a speciﬁc limit on the right of the Government to levy assessments on the lands in.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml210 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V. NANI RAANI MI & OS [] IC 8; A IR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SR 1…question, that, further, by reason of the land acquisition proceedings the right of the Provincial Government tolevy assessment even within the limits prescribed by Act No. VI of 1851 was extinguished, and that when the landswere transferred by the Central Government to Lady Pochkhanawalla and others, they got them as revenue-freelands. In the result, the appeal was dismissed. This appeal by special leave is directed against this decision.The statutory authority under which the appellant seeks to levy assessment on the lands is section 8 of BombayAct No.11 of 1876, and it is as follows:""It shall be the duty of the Collector, subject to the orders of Government, to ﬁx and to levy the assessment forland revenue.When there is no right on the part of the superior holder in limitation of the right of Government to assess, theassessment shall be ﬁxed at the discretion of the Collector subject to the control of Government.When there is a right on the part of the superior bolder in limitation of the right of Government, in consequence ofa speciﬁc limit to assessment having been established and preserved, the assessment shall not exceed suchspeciﬁc limit"".It was on the footing that the respondents were 'superior holders' as deﬁned in the Act, that the appellant issuednotices to them in April 1942. In their reply notices and in the plaints, the respondents did not dispute thatposition, but only contended in terms of section 8 that they had a speciﬁc right in limitation of the right of theGovernment to assess the 1315 lands; and the entire controversy in the Courts below was whether they hadestablished that right. No contention was raised that they were not superior holders as deﬁned in the Act, andthat, in consequence, no assessment could be imposed on the lands under section 8 of the Act.In the argument before us, the contention was sought to be raised for the ﬁrst time by the learned Attorney-General that the proceedings taken by the Collector under section 8 were incompetent, as that section wouldapply only to lands held by superior holders, that the deﬁnition of 'superior' holier' in section 3 (4) as meaning ""theperson having the highest title under the Provincial Government to any land in the City of Bombay"" would take inonly persons who held on a derivative tenure from the Government, that persons who acquired lands from theGovernment under an outright sale could not be described as 'superior holders' within section 3 (4), and that thelands held by the respondents were therefore outside the operation of section 8.On behalf of the appellant, the learned Solicitor General objected to this question being allowed to be raised atthis stage of the proceedings, as that would involve investigation of questions of fact and of law, such as whetherunder the tenures in the City of Bombay, owners held the lands as superior holders, whether under Indianjurisprudence what was paid by the occupier of land was rent or revenue, whether the prerogative right of theCrown to assess lands subsisted in the Presidency Towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras and several otherquestions, for the decision of which there were not suﬃcient materials. This objection must be upheld. In view ofthe fact that the respondents have, at all stages, claimed immunity from assessment on the basis of section 8, wedo not consider that it would be proper to allow them now to change their front, and take up a stand whollyinconsistent with what they had taken, when that involves an investigation into facts which has not been made.We must, therefore, proceed on the footing that the respondents are `superior holders' as deﬁned 1316 in section 3(4) of Act No. 11 of 1876, and that their rights are to be determined in accordance with sec- tion 8 of the Act.Construing that section, the Privy Council laid down in Goswamini' Shri Kamala Vahooji v. Collector of Bombay(1)two propositions: that though the language of the section would more appropriately apply when the dispute wasas to the quantum of assessment', the right to levy it not being itself controverted, it was open to the superiorholder under this section to plead and prove that the State had no right to levy any assessment; and that theburden was on the person who pleaded a limitation on the right of the State to assess, to clearly and unequivocallyestablish it. It is, therefore, open to the respondents to plead that the lands are wholly exempt from revenue; butthe onus of making it jut lies heavily on them.The learned Attorney-General has sought to establish a right in the respondents in limitation of the right of theappellant to assess the lands on three grounds: (1) the Foras Act No. VI of 1851, (2) the land acquisitionproceedings under Act No. VI of 1857, and (3) the sale deed, Exhibit A. Taking ﬁrst the Foras Act: For a correctappreciation of its provisions, it is necessary to refer -Co the history of the lands, which are dealt with therein. TheIsland of Bombay once formed part of the Portuguese Domi- nions in India. In 1661 when Princess Infant Catherine.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml310 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V. NANI RAANI MI & OS [] IC 8; A IR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SR 1…was married to King Charles 11 of England, it was ceded by the King of Portugal to the British Crown as dowry, andby a Royal Charter dated 27th March 1668 King Charles 11 granted it to the East India Company. At that time theIsland consisted only of the Fort and the town, and ""outside the walls of the town it was scarcely more than rockand marsh which became a group of islands every day on high tide"".Vide Shapurji Jivanji v. The Collector of Bombay(1). It appears from Warden's Report on the Landed Tenures inBombay and Le Mesurier's Report on the Foras lands, that during the 18th Century the East India Company started(1) (1937) L.R. 64 I.A. 334.(2) [ 1885] I.L.R. 9 Bom. 483, 488, 1317 reclaiming these lands, and invited the inhabitants to cultivate them, at ﬁrstwithout payment of any assessment and subsequently on favourable rates. These payments were called ""Foras"".The meaning of this word is thus explained by Westropp, J. in his note at page 40 in Naoroji Beramji v.Rogers(1):- "" foras' is derived from the Portuguese word fora (Latine foras, from foris a door), signifying outside. Ithere indicates the rent or revenue derived from outlying lands.The whole island of Bombay fell under that denomination when under Portuguese rule, being then a mere outlyingdependency of Bassein. Subsequently the term foras was, for the most part, though perhaps not quite exclusively,limited to the new salt batty ground reclaimed from the sea, or other waste ground lying outside the Fort, NativeTown, and other the more ancient settled and cultivated grounds in the island, or to the quitrent arising from thatnew salt batty ground and outlying ground"".Thus, the salt batty lands reclaimed from the sea came to be known as Foras lands by association with theassessments payable thereon called ""Foras"". The nature of the interest which the occupants had in the Foras landswas the subject of considerable debate in the beginning of the 19th Century.In 1804, the Company resumed some of the Foras lands for settling persons displaced in the Town area, and thatresulted in a suit by one Sheik Abdul Ambly, wherein the right of the Company to resume the lands waschallenged.The action failed, the Court upholding the claim of the Company to resume them, but at the same time, itobserved that its action in dispossessing the occupants would ""appear and be felt as a grievous hardship, if not anopen and downright injury"". Vide Warden's Report on the Landed Tenures of Bombay, pages 60 and 61. Thereafter,the Company had the matter further investigated, and there were reports on the subject by Warden in 1814 and LeMesurier in 1843.And ﬁnally the Company decided to recognise (1) 4 Boni. H.C.R. 1.1318 the rights of the 'Occupants, and that resulted in the enactment of Act VI of 1851.The relevant provisions of the Act may now be noticed. The preamble to the Act states that, ""Whereas the EastIndia Company are legally entitled to the freehold reversion of the several lands heretofore paying a render calledforas, the outline whereof is delineated in a plan and numbered 1, subject to certain tenancies therein at will, orfrom year to year; whereas it is considered expedient as of grace and favour that the rights of the said East IndiaCompany in all of the lands included in the said plan should be extinguished, save as hereinafter mentioned.It is enacted as follows:"" Section 2 enacts that:""From and after the said 1st day of July, the rights of the said Company in all of the said lands mentioned in thesaid plan No. 1, except those mentioned in the said plan No. 2, shall be extinguished in favour of the persons whoshall then hold the same respectively as the immediate rent-payers to the said Company, saving the rents nowseverally payable in respect of such lands, which shall continue payable and recoverable by distress, or by anymeans by which land revenue in Bombay is or shall be recoverable, under any Act or Regulation Section 4 provides:""Nothing herein contained shall exempt such lands from being liable-to any further general taxes on land inBombay "" According to the appellant, the eﬀect of these provisions was to grant the lands to the occupants on apermanent tenure, heritable and alienable, but not further to grant them on a permanent assessment. Reliancewas also placed on the decision in Shapurji Jivanji v. The Collector of Bombay(1), where it was held generally thatthe Government had the right under section 8 of the Act to enhance the assessments on Foras lands. There issome support for this contention in the provisions of the Act. The preamble (1) [ 1885] I.L.R. 9 Bom. 483, 488..la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml410 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V. NANI RAANI MI & OS [] IC 8; A IR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SR 1…1319 expressly recites that the occupants were tenants at will or from year to year, and that the reversion was withthe East India Company. One consequence of that was that the Company had the right to eject the occupants.Now, what the Company did under the Act was to give up that right as a matter of grace, because, as alreadymentioned, it would appear to have invited them to settle on the lands and cultivate them, and it did that byextinguishing its reversion as landlord.In other words, it agreed to confer on the tenants the status of owners of lands. If that was all the scope of Act No.VI of 1851, it could not be doubted that the rights of the State to enhance the assessments would not be aﬀected,because ownership of land does not per se carry with it an immunity from enhancement of assessment in exerciseof sovereign rights, and occupants of Foras lands cannot claim to be in a better position by reason of the Act thanowners of lands in ryotwari tracts, the assessments on which are liable to periodic revision. But what is against theappellant is that section 2 does not stop with merely extinguishing the reversionary rights of the Company. It goesfurther, and saves expressly ""the rents now severally payable in respect of such lands"", rent being used here in thesense of assessment, and adds ""which shall continue to be payable"". Now, the contention of the respondents isthat those words conferred on the Government a right to recover only the assessment which was then payable,and that there was thus a limitation on its right to enhance it. It is common ground that the assessment payable onthese lands at that time was 9 reas per burga, and Exhibit N shows that it was at that rate that the assessment wascollected from 1858 until the lands were acquired by the Government in land acquisition proceedings. It isaccordingly contended for the respondents that under the Act, the Government could not claim anything morethan 9 reas per burga as assessment on the lands.It is urged for the appellant that the words ""now severally payable"" could not be construed as impos- 169 1320 inga limitation on the right of the Government to enhance the assessment, as they occur in a saving clause, the scopeof which was to reserve the rights of the Company and not to confer on the occupants rights in addition to whatthe body of the section had granted to them. It is true that the setting in which these words occur is moreappropriate for reserving rights in favour of the Company than for declaring any in favour of the occupants. But toadopt the construction contended for by the appellant would be to render the words ""now severally payable"" and""which shall continue to be payable"" wholly meaningless. Notwithstanding that the drafting is inartistic, the trueimport of the clause unmistakably is that while, on the one hand, the right of the Government to recover theassessment is saved, it is, on the other hand, limited to the amount then payable by the occupants. The contentionof the respondents that under the Foras Act they acquired a speciﬁc right to hold the lands on payment ofassessment not exceeding what was then payable, must, therefore, be accepted We have next to decide whateﬀect the proceedings taken by the Government under the Land Acquisition Act No. VI of 1857 during the years1864 to 1867 have on the rights of the parties. Section VIII of the Act is as follows:""When the Collector or other oﬃcer has made an award or directed a reference to arbitration, be may takeimmediate possession of the land which shall thenceforward be vested absolutely in the Government, free from allother estates, rights, titles and interests"".The contention of the respondents which has found favour with the Courts below is that under that section theeﬀect of the vesting of the lands in the Government was to extinguish whatever interests were previously heldover them, that the right of the Government to levy assessment was such an interest, and that it was alsoextinguished. It is argued that when lands are acquired under the Act, the valuation that is made is of all theinterests subsisting thereon, including the 1321 rights of the Crown to assess the lands, as well as the interests ofthe claimants therein, that what is paid to the owners is not the full value of the lands but the value of theirinterests therein, deduction being made of the value of the right of the Government to assess from out of the fullvalue, and that, in eﬀect, there was an award of compensation for the right to assess, and that, therefore, thatright equally with the rights of the claimants over the lands would be extinguished. One of the awards has beenmarked as Exhibit P, and the respondents rely on the recitals therein that the compensation to the claimants was""for their interest in the said lands"". The award, it must be mentioned, directs the Government to pay theclaimants the amounts speciﬁed therein, but contains no provision for payment of any sum as compensation tothe Government for its right to assess the lands; nor does it even value that right. But the respondents contendedthat the Government being the authority to pay must be deemed to have paid itself, and that, in any event, if theywere entitled to compensation, their failure to claim it could not aﬀect the result, which was that the right to levyassessment would be extinguished.We are unable to accept this contention. When the Government acquires lands under the provisions of the LandAcquisition Act, it must be for a public purpose, and with a view to put them to that purpose, the Governmentacquires the sum total of all private interests subsisting in them..la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml510 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V. NANI RAANI MI & OS [] IC 8; A IR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SR 1…If the Government has itself an interest in the land, it has only to acquire the other interests outstanding therein,so that it might be in a position to pass it on absolutely for public user. In the Matter of the Land Acquisition Act:The Government of Bombay v. Esupali Salebhai(1) Batchelor, J.observed:""In other words Government, as it seems to me, are not debarred from acquiring and paying for the onlyoutstanding interests merely because the Act, which primarily contemplates all interests as held outsideGovernment, directs that the entire compen- (1) [ 1909] I.L.R. 34 Bom. 618, 686.1322 sation based upon the market value of the whole of land, must be distributed among the claimants"". There,the Government claimed ownership of the land on which there stood buildings belonging to the claimants, and itwas held that the Government was bound to acquire and pay only for the superstructure, as it was already theowner of the site.Similarly in Deputy Collector, Calicut Division v. Aiyavu Pillay(1), Wallis, J. (as he then was) observed:'It is, in my opinion, clear that the Act does not contemplate or provide for the acquisition of any interest whichalready belongs to Government in land which is being acquired under the Act, but only for the acquisition of suchinterests in the land as do not already belong to the Government"".With these observations, we are in entire agreement. When Government possesses an interest in land which is thesubject of acquisition under the Act, that interest is itself outside such acquisition, because there can be noquestion of Government acquiring what is its own. An investigation into the nature and value of that interest willno doubt be necessary for determining the compensation payable for the interest outstanding in the claimants,but that would not make it the subject of acquisition. The language of section VIII of Act No. VI of 1857 alsosupports this construction. Under that section, the lands vest in the Government ""free from all other estates,rights, titles and interests"", which must clearly mean other than those possessed by the Government. It is on thisunderstanding of the section that the award, Exhibit p, is framed. The scheme of it is that the interests of theoccupants are ascertained and valued, and the Government is -directed to pay the compensation ﬁxed for them.There is no valuation of the right of the Government to levy assessment on the lands, and there is no award ofcompensation therefor.We have so far assumed with the respondents that the right of the Government to levy assessment is an interest inland within the meaning of section VIII (1) [ 1911] 9 I-C-341.1323 of Act VI of 1857. But is this assumption wellfounded? We think not. In its normal acceptation, ""interest""means one or more of those rights which go to make up ""ownership"". It will include for example, mortgage, lease,charge, easement and the like. but the right to impose a tax on land is a prerogative right of the Crown, paramountto the ownership over the land and outside it. Under the scheme of the Land Acquisition Act, what is acquired isonly the ownership over the lands, or the inferior rights comprised therein.Section 3(b) of the Land Acquisition Act No. I of 1894 deﬁnes a ""person interested"" as including ""all personsclaiming an interest in compensation to be made on account of the acquisition of land under this Act, and a personshall be deemed to be interested in land if he is interested in an easement aﬀecting the land"". Section 9 requiresthat notices should be given to all persons who are interested in the land. Under section 11, the Collector has tovalue the land, and apportion the compensation among the claimants according to their interest in the land. Undersection 16, when the Collector make an award ""he may take possession of the land which shall thereupon vestabsolutely in the Government free from all encumbrance"". The word ""en- cumbrance"" in this section can onlymean interests in respect of which a compensation was made under section 11, or could have been claimed. Itcannot include the right of the Government to levy assessment on the lands. The Government is not a ""personinterested"" within the deﬁnition in section 3 (b), and, as already stated, the Act does not contemplate its interestbeing valued or compensation being awarded therefor.It is true that there is in Act No. VI of 1857 nothing corresponding to section 3(b) of Act No. I of 1984, but anexamination of the provisions of Act No. VI of 1857 clearly shows that the subject-matter of acquisition under thatAct was only ownership over the lands or its constituent rights and not the right of the Government to levyassessment. The provisions relating to the issue of notices to persons interested 1324 and the apportionment ofcompensation among them are substantially the same. Moreover, under section VIII the Government is to take thelands free from all other ""estates, rights, title and interest"", and ""interest"" must, in the context, be construed.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml610 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V. NANI RAANI MI & OS [] IC 8; A IR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SR 1…ejusdem generis with ""estates"" etc., as meaning right over lands, of the character of, but not amounting to anestate, and cannot include the prerogative right to assess the lands. It must accordingly be held that the eﬀect ofthe land acquisition proceedings was only to extinguish the rights of the occupants in the lands and to vest themabsolutely in the Government, that the right of the latter to levy assessment was not the subject-matter of thoseproceedings, and that if after the award the lands were not assessed to revenue, it was because there could be noquestion of the Government levying assessment on its own lands.Then there remains the question whether the sale deed, Exhibit A, imposes any limitation on the right of theCrown to assess the lands. The deed conveys the lands to the purchasers absolutely ""with all rights, easements andappurtenances whatsoever"" to be held ""for ever"". It does not, however, recite that they are to be held revenue-free.But it is argued for the respondents that where there is an absolute sale by the Crown as here, that necessarilyimports that the land is conveyed revenue-free; and section 3 of the Crown Grants Act No. XV of 1895 and certainobservations in Dadoba v. Collector of Bombay(1) were relied on as supporting this contention. Section 3 of ActNo. XV of 1895 is as follows:""All provisions restrictions, conditions and limitations over contained in any such grant or transfer as aforesaidshall be valid and take eﬀect according to their tenor any rule of law, statute or enactment of the Legislature to thecontrary notwithstanding"".The contention is that as the grant is of a freehold estate without any reservation it must, to take eﬀect accordingto its tenor, be construed as granting exemption from assessment to revenue. But that will be extending thebounds of section 3 beyond its con- (1) (1901] I.L.R. 25 Bom. 714, 1325 tents. The object of the Act as declared inthe preamble is to remove certain doubts ""as to the extent and operation of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882,and, as to the power of the Crown to impose limitations and restrictions upon grants and other transfers of landmade by it or under its authority"". Section 2 enacts that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act do not applyto Crown grants. Then follows section 3 with a positive declaration that ""all provisions, restrictions, conditions andlimitations over"" shall take eﬀect according to their tenor. Reading the enactment as a whole, the scope of section3 is that it saves ""provisions, restrictions, conditions and limitations over"" which would be bad under the provisionsof the Transfer of Property Act, such as conditions in restraint of alienations or enjoyment repugnant to the natureof the estate, limitations oﬀending the rule against perpetuities and the like. But no question arises here as to thevalidity of any provision, restriction, condition, or limitation over, contained in Exhibit A on the ground that it is incontravention of any of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, and there is accordingly nothing on whichsection 3 could take eﬀect.It is argued by the learned Attorney-General that this limitation on the scope of the Act applies in terms only tosection 2, and that section 3 goes much further, and is general and unqualiﬁed in its operation. The scope ofsection 3 came up for consideration before the Privy Council in Thakur Jagannath Baksh Singh v. The UnitedProvinces(1).After setting out that section, Lord Wright observed:""These general words cannot be read in their apparent generality. The whole Act was intended to settle doubtswhich had arisen as to the eﬀect of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, and must be read with reference to thegeneral context..............In this view, section 3 must also be construed in the light of the preamble, and so construed, it cannot, for thereasons already given, have any bearing on (1) 1946 F.L.J. 88.1326 the rights of the parties. Moreover, that section only enacts that ""all provisions, restrictions, conditions andlimitations over"" shall take eﬀect according to their tenor, and what is relied on is not any provision, restriction,condition or limitation over, in Exhibit A which according to its tenor entitles the respondents to hold the landsrent-free, but the absolute character of the interest conveyed under Exhibit A. Therefore, section 3 does not interms apply.The respondents also relied on certain observations in Dadoba v. Collector of Bombay(1) as supporting theircontention. There, the -facts were that the Government had granted one parcel of land to the Free Church Missionof Scotland revenue-free under a deed dated 1-10-1884. By another deed dated 20-12-1887 they released theirright of reversion on two other parcels of land held by the Mission as tenants but ""subject to the payment of taxes,.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml710 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V. NANI RAANI MI & OS [] IC 8; A IR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SR 1…rates, charges, assessments leviable or chargeable in respect of the said premises or anything for the time beingthereon"".On 16-1-1888 the Mission sold all the three parcels to one Janardan Gopal, and the Secretary of State joined in theconveyance for eﬀectually releasing the reversion of the Government. Before Janardan Gopal purchased the lands,there had been correspondence between his solicitors and the Government as to the assessment payable on thelands, and the Government had intimated that it would be 9 pies per square yard per annum. Subsequent to thepurchase, the Collector raised the assessment payable on the lands, and the point for decision was whether hecould lawfully do so.In deciding that he could not, Sir Lawrence Jenkins stated that the purchaser had paid full value for the lands in thebelief induced by the Government that the assessment of 9 pies per sq. yard would be permanent, and that on thefacts, the case fell within section 115 of the Evidence Act, and that the Government was estopped from enhancingthe assessment. He was also prepared to hold that the correspondence between the purchaser and theGovernment prior to (1) [ 1901] I.L.R. 25 Bom. 714.1327 the sale amounted to a collateral contract not to raise the assessment. Chandavarkar, J., concurred in thedecision, and in the course of his judgment observed:"".... when we have regard to the nature of the transaction, viz., that Government was selling the property out-and-out as any private proprietor-when we look to the whole of the language used .... the intention of the parties mustbe taken to have been that the purchaser was to be liable to pay the amount of 9 pies per square yard per annumthen levied as assessment and no more"".These observations have been relied on as supporting the contention that when there is an absolute sale by theGovernment, it amounts to an agreement not to levy more assessment than was payable at that time. But theremarks of the learned Judge have reference to the recitals in the deed dated 20-12-1887 and the negotiationsbetween the purchaser and the Government which are referred to in the passage, and not to the character of thetransfer as an absolute sale; and the decision is based on a ﬁnding of estoppel or collateral contract deducible fromthe correspondence between the purchaser and the Government.Neither section 3 of the Crown Grants Act, nor the observa- tions in Dadoba v. Collector of Bombay(1) lend anysupport to the contention that an absolute sale of lands by the Government ipso facto confers on the purchasers aright to hold the lands free of revenue.The question then is whether on the, terms of Exhibit A such a right could be held to have been granted. There wassome discussion at the Bar as to the correct rule of construction applicable to the deed, Exhibit A. It was argued bythe learned Solicitor. General for the appellant that being a Crown grant, Exhibit A should be construed in favourof the Crown and against the grantee. On the other hand, it was argued by the learned Attorney-General that itshould make no diﬀerence in the construction of the grant, whether the grantor was the Crown or a subject, as (1)[ 1901] I.L.R. 25 Bom. 714. 170 1328 the question in either case was what had been granted; and that must bedetermined on the language of the deed. When closely examined, it will be seen that there is no real conﬂictbetween the two propositions. The former is in the nature of a rule of substantive law; and its scope is that whereas the transferee from a subject acquires, unless the contrary appears, all the rights which the transferor has in theproperty as enacted in section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act, a grantee from the Crown gets only what isgranted by the deed, and nothing passes by implication. But when the grant is embodied in a deed, the questionultimately reduces itself to a determination of what was granted thereunder. What the Court has to do is toascertain the intention of the grantor from the words of the document, and as the same words cannot besusceptible of two diﬀerent meanings, it makes no diﬀerenbe whether they occur in a grant by the Crown or by thesubject. If the words used in a grant by a subject would be eﬀective to pass an interest, then those words mustequally be eﬀective to pass the same interest when they occur in a Crown grant.Dealing with this question, Sir John Coleridge observed in Lord v. Sydney(1):""But it is unnecessary for their Lordships to say more on this point, because they are clearly of opinion, that uponthe true construction of this grant, the creek where it bounds the land is ad medium ﬁlm, included within it. In soholding they do not intend to diﬀer from old authorities in respect to Crown grants; but upon a question of themeaning of the words, the same rules of common sense and justice must apply, whether the subject-matter of.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml810 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V.

As already stated, there is no recital in the deed thatthe purchasers are entitled to, hold the lands free of assessment. On the other hand, it (1) (1859] [ 1859] EngR 307;12 Moore P.C. 473, 496, 497; [ 1859] EngR 307; 14 E.R. 991, 1000.1329 expressly provides that the properties will be subject ""to the payment of all cesses, taxes, rates, assessments,dues and duties whatsoever now or hereafter to become payable in respect thereof"", which words would in theirnatural and ordinary sense cover the present assessment. In Dadoba v.Collector of Bombay(1), the Court had to consider a clause similar to the above contained in a deed executed bythe Government in favour of the Mission on 20-12-1887. Dis- cussing the eﬀect of this clause on the rights of theplaintiﬀ to hold the property permanently on an assessment of 9 pies per sq. yard, Chandavarkar, J. observed:""When that deed says that the property was sold 'subject to the payment of all taxes, rates, charges, assessmentsleviable or chargeable', it leaves the question open as to what the taxes etc., are which are `leviable or chargeable'.Extrinsic evidence of that is admissible, for it neither contradicts nor varies the terms of the deed, but explains thesense in which the parties understood the words of the deed, which, taken by themselves, are capable ofexplanation: see Bank of New Zealand v. Simpson (2) "".In that case, the dispute was not as to the liability to pay any assessment but to the quantum of assessmentpayable, and it was a possible view to take that the clause in question was not decisive on that question, and that itwas left open. But here, the question is whether a right was granted to the purchasers to hold the lands free fromliability to be assessed, and the clause in Exhibit A clearly negatives such a right. Even if we are to regard thequestion as left open, as observed in Dadoba v. Collector of Bombay(1), it will not assist the respondents, as theyhave not established aliunde any right to hold the lands free from assessment. It must, therefore, be held that farfrom ex- empting the lands from liability to be assessed to revenue, Exhibit A expressly subjects them to it.It was ﬁnally contended that even if the land acquisition proceedings between 1864 and 1867 had not the (1) [ 1901]I.L.R. 25 Bom. 714.(2) [ 1900] UKLawRpAC 6; 1900 A.C. 182.1330 eﬀect of extinguishing the right of the Government to levy assessment, and that even if Exhibit A conferredon the purchasers no right to hold the land revenue-free, the assessment which the Government was entitled tolevy under section 8 of Act No. II of 1876 was limited to what was payable under the Foras Act No. VI of 1851, andthat the appellant had no right to levy assessment at a rate exceeding the same. The argument in support of thecontention was that it was an incident of the Foras tenure under which the lands wore held, that the occupantswere bound to pay only a ﬁxed assessment, that the incident was annexed to the lands, and was inseparabletherefrom, that between the dates when the lands were acquired under the Land Acquisition at No. VI of 1857 and22-11-1938 when they were sold under Exhibit A they continued to retain their character as Foras lands, that if noassessment was paid on the lands during that period, it was because the hand to pay and the hand to receive werethe same, that when they came to the respondents under Exhibit A, they became impressed with the Foras tenure,and that, in consequence, they were liable to be assessed only at the rate payable under Act No.VI of 1851.This contention is, in our judgment, wholly untenable. When the lands were acquired under the Land AcquisitionAct No.VI of 1857, the entire ""estate, right, title and interest"" subsisting thereon became extinguished, and the landsvested in the Government absolutely freed from Foras tenure, and when they were sold by the Government underExhibit A the purchasers obtained them as freehold and not as Foras lands.As the tenure under which the lands were originally held had become extinguished as a result of the landacquisition proceedings, it was incapable of coming back to life, when the lands were sold under Exhibit A..la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/8.h/020THOLLECTOUSSERWJTTJISTRR1955NS95995C3wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml910 9/12/2E CR OF BOMBAY V. NANI RAANI MI & OS [] IC 8; A IR 15 SC 28; 15 (1) SR 1…In support of the contention that the incidents of the Foras tenure continued to attach to the lands in the hands ofthe respondents, the learned Attorney General relied on the following observations of 1331 Das, J. in Collector ofBombay v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay and others(1):- ""The immunity from the liability to payrent is just as much an integral part or an inseverable incident of the title so acquired as is the obligation to holdthe land for the purposes of a market and for no other purpose"".But the point for decision there was whether the Municipal Corporation of Bombay could acquire by prescription aright to hold the lands rent-free, they having entered into possession under a resolution of the Government thatno rent would be charged. And the passage quoted above merely laid down that when title to the land wasacquired by the Municipal Corporation by prescription, one of the rights acquired as part of the prescriptive title'was the right to hold the lands revenue-free. But the question here is whe- ther the right to hold the lands under aﬁxed assessment survived after the acquisition by the Government under the land acquisition proceedings, andthat depends on the eﬀect of section VIII of Act VI of 1857. If, as observed in the above passage, the liability to payassessment was ""an integral part or an inseverable incident of the title"", then surely it was also extinguished alongwith the title of the occupants under section VIII of Act No. VI of 1857.There is another diﬃculty in the way of accepting the contention of the respondents. The Foras Act was repealedin 1870 by Act No. XIV of 1870 long prior to the date of Exhibit A, and therefore, even if we hold that the Forastenure revived in the hands of the purchasers under Exhibit A, the rights under the Foras Act were no longeravailable in respect of the lands. Section I of Act No. XIV of 1870 saves rights ""already acquired or accrued"", and it isargued that the rights now claimed are within the saving clause.But as the lands had all been acquired under Act No. VI of 1857 between 1864 and 1867 there were no rights inrespect of the lands which could subsist at the date of the repeal, and the rights now claimed (1) [ 1951] INSC 46;1952 S.C.R. 43, 52, 1332 by the respondents are not within the saving clause. In the result, it must be held that theright of the appellant to levy assessment under section 8 of Act No. II of 1876 is not limited by any right in therespondents.We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgments of the Courts below, and dismiss both the suitsinstituted by the respondents with costs throughout.Appeal allowed."

THE ST ATE OF PEPSU [15] INSC 9; AIR 15 SC 309; 15 (1) SCR 130 2 (28 Febru ary 15)works at a place called Karhali. It was part of his duties to disburse the wages to the workmen employed in theworks, and the procedure usually followed was that be drew the amount required from the treasury, and paid thesame to the emplo- yees against their signatures or thumb-impressions in the monthly acquittance roll. In the rollfor April 1951, one Parma was mentioned as a khalasi (menial servant), and a sum of Rs. 51 shown as paid to himfor his wages, the payment being vouched by thumbimpression. The case of the prosecution was that there was,in fact, no person of the name of Parma, that the thumb-impression found in the acquittance roll was that of theappellant himself, that he had included a ﬁctitious name in the acquittance roll, with intent to himself draw theamount, and that by this expedient he had received Rs. 51 and misappropriated the same.The First-Class Magistrate of Patiala, before whom the appellant was put up for trial, framed charges against himunder section 465 of the Indian Penal Code for forging the thumb-impression of Parma, and under section 409 ofthe Indian Penal Code for criminal misappropriation of Rs. 51, and after a full trial, 167 1304 acquitted him. He heldon the evidence that ""there was a khalasi Parma by name in the service of the accused at Kehrauli"", and thatthough the thumbimpression in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant, the prosecution had not establishedthat the amount drawn by him did not reach the hands of Parma. Against this judgment, there was an appeal bythe State to the High Court of Pepsu, which held that proof that the thumb-impression in the acquittance roll wasthat of the appellant was suﬃcient, ,.when taken along with other circumstances, to establish his guilt, andaccordingly convicted him both under section 465 and section 409 of the Indian Penal Code. This appeal by specialleave is directed against this judgment.In support of "" the appeal it is argued by Mr. Jai Gopal Sethi that the conviction of the appellant is illegal, assanction had not been obtained under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for his prosecution, thatthe evidence on record is insuﬃcient to establish an oﬀence either under section 465 or section 409 of the IndianPenal Code and that there having been an acquittal of the appellant by the trial Magistrate, the materials on recorddid not justify a reversal of that verdict by the appellate Court.The question of sanction under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be taken up ﬁrst forconsideration, as it goes to the root of the matter. The facts bearing on this question are that there was anapplication by the Department for sanction to prosecute the appellant for an oﬀence under section 409, and that,the Chief Secretary, Home Department, sent the communication, Exhibft PX, stating that he had been ""directed toconvey sanction of the Government to his prosecution"". In view of this, no question was raised before the trialMagistrate or the High Court that the prosecution was bad for want of sanction. But after the disposal of theappeal by the High Court, it was discovered that, in fact, there was no order of the Government sanctioning theprosecution, and that the Chief Secretary had committed a mistake in sendidg the communication, Exhibit PX.1305 The position, therefore, is that the prosecution which has resulted in the conviction of the appellant wasinitiated without any sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and if sanction under thatsection is necessary, as contended for by Mr. Sethi, then the entire proceedings including the conviction must bequashed.According to the respondent, however, the main charge against the appellant is under section 409, and nosanction is required for a prosecution under that section. The point for decision is whether sanction under section197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is necessary for prosecuting the appellant under section 409. - There hasbeen considerable divergence of judicial opinion on the scope of section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.The question has latterly been the subject of consideration by the highest Courts in this country, and by the PrivyCouncil, and the position may now be taken to be fairly well-settled. Hori Ram Singh v. Emperor(1) is a decision ofthe Federal Court on the necessity for sanction under section 270 of the Government of India Act, 1935, which issimilar in terms to section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The facts in that case were that a Sub-Assistant Surgeon was charged under section 409 with having dishonestly removed certain medicines from ahospital which was under his charge, to his own residence, and under section 477-A, with having failed to enterthem in the stock book. The sanction of the Government had not been obtained for the prosecution under section270 of the Government of India Act, and the point for decision was whether it was necessary. It was held that thecharge under section 477-A required sanction, as ""the oﬃcial capacity is involved in the very act complained of asamounting to a crime""; but that no sanction was required for a charge under section 409, because ""the oﬃcialcapacity is material only in connection with the 'entrustment' and does not necessarily enter into the later act ofmisappropriation or conversion, which is the act complained of"".(1) [ 1939] F.C.R. 159.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/9.html/959595959525 9/12/ 2020AMRIK SINGH V. THE ST ATE OF PEPSU [15] INSC 9; AIR 15 SC 309; 15 (1) SCR 130 2 (28 Febru ary 15)1306 In the course of his judgment, Varadachariar, J. discussed the scope of section 197(1) of the Code of CriminalProcedure and after observing that the decisions on that section were not uniform, proceeded to group themunder three categories-those which had held that sanction was necessary when the act complained of attached to'the oﬃcial character of the person doing it, those which had held that it was necessary in all cases in which theoﬃcial character of the person gave him an opportunity for the commission of the crime, and those which hadheld it necessary when the oﬀence was committed while the accused was actually engaged in the performance ofoﬃcial duties.The learned Judge expressed his agreement with the ﬁrst of the three views.In H. H. B. Gill v. The King(1), the question arose directly with reference to section 197(1) of the Code of CriminalProcedure. There, the accused was charged under section 161 with taking bribes, and under section 120-B withconspiracy.On the question whether sanction was necessary under section 197(1) it was held by the Privy Council that therewas no diﬀerence in scope between that section and section 270 of the Government of India Act, 1935, andapproving the statement of the law by Varadachariar, J. in Hori Ram Singh v. Emperor(2), Lord Simonds observed:""A public servant can only be said to act or to purport to act in the discharge of his oﬃcial duty, if his act is such asto lie within the scope of his oﬃcial duty........The test may well be whether the public servant, if challenged, can reasonably claim that, what he does, he does invirtue of his oﬃce"".It was accordingly held that as the acts with which the accused was charged could not be justiﬁed as done by virtueof his oﬃce, no sanction was necessary. The view taken in H. H. B. Gill v. The King(1) was followed by the PrivyCouncil in A16 ert West Meads v. The King(-'), and reaﬃrmed in Phanindra Chandra v.(1) [ 1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.(2) [ 1939] F.C.R. 159.(3) [ 1948] L.,R. 70 I.A. 185, 1307 The King(1), and adopted by this Court in R. W. Mathams V.State of We8t Bengal(1).The result of the authorities may thus be summed up: It is not every oﬀence committed by a public servant thatrequires sanction for prosecution under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure; nor even every act doneby him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his oﬃcial duties; but if the act complained of is directlyconcerned with his oﬃcial duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of theoﬃce, then sanction would be necessary; and that would be so, irrespective of whether it was, in fact, a properdischarge of his duties, because that would really be a matter of defence on the merits, which would have to be in-vestigated at the trial, and could not arise at the stage of the grant of sanction, which mu_t precede the institutionof the prosecution.It is conceded for the respondent that on the principle above enunciated, sanction would be required forprosecuting the appellant under section 465, as the charge was in respect of his duty of obtaining signatures orthumb- impressions of the employees before wages were paid to them.But he contends that misappropriation of funds could, under no circumstances, be said to be within the scope ofthe duties of a public servant, that he could not, when charged with it, claim justiﬁcation for it by virtue of hisoﬃce, that therefore no sanction under section 197(1) was necessary, and that the question was concluded by thedecisions in Hori Ram Singh v. Emperor(1) and Albert We8t Meads v. The King(1), in both of which the chargeswere of criminal misappropriation. We are of opinion that this is too broad a statement of the legal position, andthat the two decisions cited lend no support to it. In our judgment, even when the charge is one ofmisappropriation by a public servant, whether sanction is required under section 197(1) will depend upon the factsof each case. If the acts complained of are so integrally connected with the duties attach- (1) [ 1949] L.R. 76 I.A. 10.(3) [ 1939] F.C.R. 159.(2) [ 1955] 1 S.O.R. 216.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/9.html/959595959535 9/12/ 2020AMRIK SINGH V.

The State of Bombay(1) thenecessity for sanction under section 197(1), when the charge was one of misappropriation under section 409.There, the law was laid down in the following terms:""The section has content and its language must be given meaning. What it says is- 'When any public servant........ isaccused of any oﬀence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the dischargeof his oﬃcial duty.........We have therefore ﬁrst to concentrate on the word ""oﬀence'.Now an oﬀence seldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a rule, a wholeseries of acts must be proved before it can be established.In the present case, the elements alleged against the second accused are, ﬁrst, that there was an 'entrustment'and/or 'dominion'; second, that the entrustment and/or dominion was 'in his capacity as a public servant'; third,that there was a 'disposal'; and fourth, that the disposal was 'dishonest'.Now it is evident that the entrustment and/or dominion here were in an oﬃcial capacity, and it is equally evidentthat there could in this case be no disposal, lawful or otherwise, save by an act done or purporting to be done in anoﬃcial capacity"".On the facts, it was held in that case that the several acts which were complained of, were oﬃcial acts, and thatthe prosecution was bad for want of sanction.The decisions in Hori Ram Singh v. Emperor(1), and Albert West Meads v. The King(1), when properly examined, donot support the extreme contention (1) [ 1955] 1 B.C.R. 1177. (2) [ 1989] F.C.R. 159.(3) [ 1948] L.R 75 I.A. 185.1309 urged on behalf of the respondent. In Hori Ram Singh v.Emperor(1), the medicines had not been entered in the stock book, and were removed by the accused to hisresidence, and the charge against him was that in so removing them he had committed MISappropriation. It wasno part of the duty of the accused to remove medicines to his house, and he could not claim that he did so byvirtue of his oﬃce. He could have made such a claim if he had, let us suppose, entered the medicines in- the stockbooks and shown them as expended in the hospital. But, on the facts, no oﬃcial act was involved, and that waswhy Varadachariar, J. observed that, "".... so far as the charge under section 409 was con cerned, the acts in respectof which he was intended to be prosecuted could not be regarded as acts done or purported to be done inexecution of his duty"".Reference may also be made to the following observations of Sulaiman, J. in the same case:""The question whether a criminal breach of trust can be committed while purporting to act in execution of his dutyis not capable of being answered hypothetically in the abstract, without any reference to the actual facts of thecase. An attempt to answer the question in a generalized way has been responsible for loose language used insome of the cases cited before us.... The question whether the act purported to have been done in execution ofduty or not must depend on the special circumstances of each case"".In Albert West Meads v. The King(1), an Army Oﬃcer had received two sums of money, and was subsequentlyunable to produce them. He was charged with criminal misappropriation, and convicted. He contended that theconviction was illegal for want of sanction, but the Privy Council, following H. H. B. Gill v. The King(1), rejected thiscontention. It is essential to note that the accused did not claim to have spent the amount in the course of hisoﬃcial duties, but stated that the moneys had been con- sumed by ﬁre. It is with reference to these facts that thePrivy Council observed:(1) [ 1939] F.C.R. 159. (2) [ 1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 185.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/9.html/959595959545 9/12/ 2020AMRIK SINGH V.

If they do,then sanction is requisite. But if they are unconnected with such duties, then no sanction is necessary.In this view, we have to examine whether the acts with which the appellant is charged directly bear on the dutieswhich he has got to discharge as a public servant. The appellant received the sum of Rs. 51 alleged to have beenmisappropriated, as Subdivisions Oﬃcer, and he admits receipt of the same. Then it was his duty to pay thatamount to the khalasi Parma, and take his signature or thumb-impression in acknowledgment thereof. Theaccused does claim to have paid the amount to Parma, and the acquittance roll records the payment, and there isin acknowledgment thereof a thumb-impression as against his name. If what appears on the face of the roll is true-and whether it is true or not is not a matter relevant at the stage of sanction-then the acts with which the appellantis charged fall within the scope of his duties, and can be justiﬁed by him as done by virtue of his oﬃce. Clearly,therefore, sanction was required under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the appellant couldbe prosecuted under section 409, and the absence of such sanc- tion is fatal to the maintainability of theprosecution.The conviction should, therefore, be quashed.In this view, there is no need to consider whether on the evidence, the oﬀence of criminal misappropriation orforgery has been brought home to the appellant or not.The appeal is accordingly allowed, and the convictions and sentences passed on the appellant arc set aside. Fine, ifpaid, will be refunded.Appeal allowed."

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal by specialleave from the judginent of the High Court at Allababad. The sole appellant before us has been convicted by theSessions Court under sections 148, 307 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to rigorous imprisonmentfor two and a half years under section 148, to transportation for life under section 307, and to death under section302. These convictions and sentences have been conﬁrmed by the High Court. At the trial there were 19 otheraccused along with this appellant. All of them were convicted and sentenced by the trial court under varioussections of the Indian Penal Code. On appeal ten out of them were acquitted by the High Court. In respect of theremaining nine besides this appellant, the convictions and sentences were partially modiﬁed. But this appeal is notconcerned with them. The incident in the course of which these oﬀences are said to have been committed tookplace in the evening of the 4th January, 1953, shortly before sun set in a village called Sonari in the districtFatehpur, Uttar Pradesh. During that incident two persons, Bisheshwar and Surajdin, are alleged to have receivedgun-shot wounds. Bisheshwar survived but Surajdin died on the spot. The back-ground for this incident was asfollows: In the village of Sonari there were two factions between whom there was prior history of enmity resultingin criminal prosecutions by each against the other. It 1334 may be broadly stated that the accused persons in thepresent case belong to one party and the prosecution witnesses as well as the deceased person belong to theother party. In the year 1946 there was rioting between them in which two of the present prosecution witnesseswere assaulted. This led to a criminal case against some of the present accused and others, in which they wereconvicted and sentenced, the members of the other party ﬁguring there in as prosecution witnesses. Again, justﬁve months prior to the present incident, there was another rioting in the village between these two groups. Inthat, one Rain Bharosey a member of the party of the present accused was killed. As a result 15 persons of theopposite-party (i. e.the party of the present prosecution witnesses) were prosecuted. By the date of this incident that case had beencommitted to the sessions but the sessions trial had not started. According to the prosecution case, the occasionfor the incident, which concerns us, was that some of the present accused wanted to persuade or prevent amember of the opposite-party by name, Bisheshwar-P.W. 2 in this case- from doing what is called pairavi on behalfof the accused in that case. (Pairavi is said to be the active assistance in relation to Court proceedings which afriend or agent renders to a litigant). While, Bisheshwar, P.W. 2, and two others Bhurey Lal, P.W. 1, and Ram Saran,P.W. 3, were sitting in front of the house of Ram Saran on the evening of the 4th January, 1953, the presentappellant and the other accused are said to have turned up before them,' lathies in hand. The appellant is said tohave asked Bisheshwar to give up doing pairavis in the then pending case on behalf of the accused therein.Bisheshwar having declined to do so, the appellant is said to have pulled out a pistol from his inner pocket andﬁred at him, as a result of which he fell down on the ground. P.Ws. 2 and 3 are said to have dragged him inside thehouse and chained the door from inside, run up the roof and raised an alarm, whereupon a number of persons ofthe other party are said to have come running up.One of the persons who so came running up was 1335 Surajdin who was cutting fodder at the house of Bhurey Lal,P.W. 1. The appellant is said to have ﬁred at him with the pistol. He fell down and died on the spot. Another personnamed Gaya Prasad is said to have received some minor lathi injuries. Accused party thereafter is said to have runaway. First information of the report was lodged by Bhurey Lal, P.W. 1, near about 12 that very night at the policestation which was about nine miles from the scene of the occurrence. The police came on the scene the nextmorning and the usual investigation followed. The police ﬁled on the 22nd February, 1953, a charge-sheet foroﬀences under sections 147, 148, 323/149 and 307/149. The charge-sheet in so far as it was under section 323/149related presumably to some minor injuries said to have been received by Gaya Prasad, and in so far as it was undersection 307/149 related presumably to the gun-shot wounds received by Bisheshwar, P.W. 2. It may be noticed thatthe charge-sheet did not concern itself with any oﬀence or oﬀences alleged to have been committed, in bringingabout the death of Surajdin by the ﬁring of a pistol at him. It is on this charge-sheet that cognizance of the casewas taken by the Magistrate and committal proceedings were started. It appears, however, that the complainant-party ﬁnding that the police challan did not relate to the oﬀence under sec- tion 302, Indian Penal Code ﬁled, onthe 2nd May, 1953, a private complaint, before the very Magistrate in whose court the committal proceedingswere by then pending. That complaint was ﬁled by the same Bisheshwar, P.W. 1, who lodged the ﬁrst informationin this case on the 5th January, 1953. It sets out substantially the same facts.This complaint also was taken on the ﬁle of the Magistrate.The enquiry thereon was merged into the enquiry relating to the police challan case. The Magistrate eventuallycommitted all the 20 accused to take their trial before the Sessions Judge by framing charges, under sections 147,323/149, 307/149 and 302/149. There was a speciﬁc charge under section 148, Indian Penal Code against Suraj Palg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/10./959519533rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html26 9/12/ 2020SURAJ PAL V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [15] INSC 10; AIR 15 SC 49; 15 (1) SCR 12 (1 Mah 15)and 1336 Dharm Raj, the former for being armed with a pistol and the latter for being armed with a pharsa, at thetime of the commission of the rioting. It is in respect of charges so framed by the committing Magistrate withoutany amendment or alteration that the accused were tried in the Sessions Court. It may be mentioned at this stagethat the defence of the accused, apart from the general denial of their hav- ing anything to do with the incidentand denials as to their having been present at the occurrence, was to the eﬀect that it was the complainant' s partyincluding the deceased Surajdin who formed the unlawful assembly, with the common object of beating one RamPal of the village. This Ram Pal had appeared as a prosecution witness at the committal stage in the criminalproceedings by then pending against the present prosecution witnesses as accused. It was also their defence thatit was one Ram Bhawan of that party who, in the course of the incident, ﬁred pistol shots in the air and also shot,later, Surajdin and brought about his death.The learned Sessions Judge found all the accused guilty of the various oﬀences as charged and sentenced them.On appeal the High Court considered the prosecution evidence with reference to three aspects. (1) How far themanner in which the prosecution alleged the incident to have taken place can be accepted; (2) How far theprosecution case regarding the presence and participation of the various per- sons can be accepted; and (3) Whatoﬀence can be said to have been made out as against each of them. On the ﬁrst question the High Court acceptedthe view that the incident took place as alleged by the prosecution. With reference to the second, the High Courtset out elaborately various reasons why the prosecution evidence in so far as it implicates particular individuals,could not be accepted at its face value and required to be carefully scrutinized.With reference to certain criteria which it was considered necessary and right to adopt for purposes of scrutiny, theHigh Court held that the convictions of ten out of the 20 persons before it should be set aside and that 1337 theother ten persons including the present appellant were participants in the rioting. Accordingly, the Courtconﬁrmed the conviction as against these ten under section 147, Indian Penal Code. As regards the charge undersection 148, Indian Penal Code, Dharm Raj was acquitted but the conviction of Suraj Pal was maintained on theground of his having a pistol in his hand at the time of the rioting.There remained the three charges against the ten persons under sections 323/149 for injuries on Gaya Prasad,307/149 in respect of the gun-shot wounds received by Bisheshwar, and 302/149 in respect of the murder ofSurajdin. It was held that the assault on Gaya Prasad wasn' t proved beyond doubt and hence, all the accused wereacquitted in respect of this charge. As regards the other two charges, i.e., under sections 307/149 and 302/149, theHigh Court came to the conclusion that neither the attempt on the life of Bisheshwar by pistol ﬁre nor the actualdeath of Surajdin by pistol ﬁre can be said to have been in prosecution of the common object of the unlawfulassembly nor to have been within the knowledge of the accused as being so likely. It was, therefore, held that noneof the accused could be found guilty under section 149, with reference to, the attempt on the life of Bisheshwar, orthe death of Surajdin. All the same, in view of the fact that the evidence showed that the person who inﬂicted thepistol ﬁre as against both was the appellant Suraj Pal, it was held that he was guilty of the oﬀences under sections307 and 302, Indian Penal Code. On this ground, therefore, the High Court, while it set aside the convictions andsentences of all the accused under sections 307/149 and 302/149, maintained the ' convictions of the appellantunder these two sections and maintained the sentences of transportation for life under section 307 and of deathunder section 302, Indian Penal Code. The High Court convicted the other nine persons under section 323/149 inrespect of the injuries received by P.W. 2 and sentenced them therefor.On the above statement of the course of these proceedings, one important fact which emerges is that 1338 therehave been no direct and individual charges against the appellant for the speciﬁc oﬀences under sections 307 and302, Indian Penal Code. The question that arises is whether' , without such direct charges the convictions andsentences for those oﬀences can be maintained. It appears to us quite clear that a charge against a person as amember of an unlawful assembly in respect of an oﬀence committed by one or other of the members of thatassembly in prosecu- tion of its common object is a substantially diﬀerent one from a charge against any individualfor an oﬀence directly committed by him while being a member of such assembly. The liability of a person inrespect of the latter is only for acts directly committed by him, while in respect of the former, the liability is for actswhich may have been done by any one of the other members of the unlawful assembly, provided that it was inprosecution of the common object of the assembly or was such as the members knew to be likely to be socommitted. A charge under section 149, Indian Penal Code puts the person on notice only of two alleged facts, viz.(1) that the oﬀence was committed by one or other of the members of the unlawful assembly of which he is one,and (2) that the oﬀence was committed in prosecution of the common object or is such that was known to be likelyto be so committed. Whether or not section 149, Indian Penal Code creates a distinct oﬀence (as regards whichthere has been conﬂict of views in the High Courts), there can be no doubt that it creates a distinct head of criminalg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/10./959519533rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html36 9/12/ 2020SURAJ PAL V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [15] INSC 10; AIR 15 SC 49; 15 (1) SCR 12 (1 Mah 15)liability which has come to be known as "" constructive liability""-a convenient phrase not used in the Indian PenalCode. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the direct individual liability of a person can only be ﬁxed upon himwith reference to a speciﬁc charge in respect of the particular oﬀence. Such a case is not covered by sections 236and 237 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The framing of a speciﬁc and distinct charge in respect of every distinctbead of criminal liability constituting an oﬀence, is the foundation for a conviction and sentence therefore Theabsence, therefore, of speciﬁc 1339 charges against the appellant under sections 307 and 302, Indian Penal Code inrespect of which he has been sentenced to transportation for life And to death respectively, is a very serious lacunain the proceedings in so far as it concerns him. The question then which arises for consideration is whether or notthis lacuna has prejudiced him in his trial.It is perfectly true that the initial accusation as disclosed by the ﬁrst information lodged by the com- plainant, P.W.1, on the 5th January, 1953, speciﬁcally, was to the eﬀect that it was this appellant who with a pistol ﬁred both asagainst Bisheshwar, P.W. 2, as also against the deceased, Surajdin. It is also true that this allegation was repeatedin the private complaint ﬁled by this same P.W. I in May, 1953, directly before the Magistrate. It is also undeniablethat the evidence in court, both in the committal proceedings as well as at the sessions trial, given by theprosecution witnesses was in support of that allegation. But curiously enough, apart from the absence of anyindividual charges against the appellant for these speciﬁc oﬀences, even the charges against him and othersrelating to the injuries inﬂicted on P.W. 2 and the deceased Surajdin are somewhat vague as to the authorshipthereof The relevant charges run as follows (after specifying the members alleged to constitute the unlawfulassembly):"" Firstly:-That you, on the 4th day of January 1953 at about half an hour before sunset in village Sonari, formed anunlawful assembly with the common object of committing the murders of Bisheshwar and Suraj Din andcommitted rioting.And thereby committed an oﬀence punishable under section 147 of the Indian Penal Code.Secondly:-That you on the same date, time and place, in prosecution of the common object of the said unlawfulassembly of which you were members at that time committed the murder of Suraj Din who was shot dead by apistol ﬁre.And thereby committed an oﬀence punishable under section 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1340 Thirdly:-Thatyou on the same date, time and place, in prosecution of the common object of the said unlawful assembly of whichyou were members at that time attempted to commit the murder of Bisheshwar Singh by means of a pistol ﬁre.And thereby committed an oﬀence punishable under section 307/149 of the Indian Penal Code"".The portions underlined (for the purposes of this judgment) in the charge under heads 2 and 3 above are curiouslyvague.They appear to indicate a deﬁnite non-committal attitude on the part of the Public Prosecutor and the Court,which has the ultimate responsibility for the framing of the charge, (vide section 226, Code of Criminal Procedure)as to who is the active author of the pistol ﬁre referred to under these two heads of charge. When the charge wasso pointedly vague, no accused was bound to direct his attention in his defence to the question as to whether he orsomebody else was the person who ﬁred the pistol which brought about the gun-shot wounds. It has been broughtto our notice that the appellant has been speciﬁcally questioned in the Court of Sessions under section 342, Codeof Criminal Procedure on the footing that he was the person who ﬁred at P.W. 2 and the deceased, Surajdin, andthat the accused denied it. But this cannot be said to remove any prejudice that would arise by virtue of thevagueness in the charge at the sessions trial, as to who was the author of the pistol ﬁre.Normally in a sessions trial the accused has no right of cross-examination after the questioning under section 342,Code of Criminal Procedure. It has been suggested that since such a question was put also in the questioning bythe committing Magistrate under section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused had ample notice of thisspeciﬁc case before the commencement of the sessions trial. But it does not follow that there could be noprejudice. On the other hand, the very fact that in spite of such questioning the charges framed in the Magistrate' sCourt, with their vagueness, in so far as this feature therein is concerned, has been 1341 maintained, before theSessions Court without any amendment, is likely to have been misleading. The appellant might well have relied onthe absence of any such amendment as being an indication that he was not called upon to defend himself on thefooting of his being the author of the pistol ﬁre. In a case so serious as that which involves the sentences ofg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/10./959519533rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html46 9/12/ 2020SURAJ PAL V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [15] INSC 10; AIR 15 SC 49; 15 (1) SCR 12 (1 Mah 15)transportation for life, and of death, and particularly in a case like the present one, where the death sentence hasbeen awarded in the trial court by distinguishing this appellant from all the other accused in respect of hisindividual act by way of pistol ﬁre, it is diﬃcult to say that the accused has not been prejudiced by the absence ofspeciﬁc charges under sections 307 and 302, Indian Penal Code.Further, the medical evidence indicates that P.W. 2 as well as the deceased Surajdin had gun-shot wounds on theirperson. The evidence of the Doctor is to the eﬀect that these wounds may have been caused by a country pistolwhich, it is alleged, the appellant had in his hand. It has been suggested on behalf of the defence that the MedicalOﬃcer was not competent to speak about it and that if the prosecution wanted to rely thereupon, they shouldhave called an arms expert to speak to the same. Whether or not this comment is legitimate, it is clear that if theappellant is to be found directly responsible for inﬂicting the wounds, noted as gun-shot wounds by the MedicalOﬃcer, he might well have availed himself of the opportunity to elucidate, by cross-examination or positivedefence, the nature of the ﬁre-arm which would have caused the actual injuries found on the bodies of P. W. 2 andof deceased Surajdin. In all the circumstances above noticed, we are satisﬁed that the absence of speciﬁc chargesagainst the appellant under sections 307 and 302, Indian Penal Code has materially prejudiced him. We mustaccordingly set aside the convictions and sentences of the appellant under sections 307 and 302 of the Indian PenalCode.The further question that arises is whether or not we are to direct a retrial of the appellant in respect of theseoﬀences. We have given our best considera- 1342 tion to all the circumstances of this case and have for thispurpose looked into the evidence and the material on the record. The case discloses certain outstanding features.At the very outset and simultaneously with the ﬁrst information ﬁled by P.W. 1 in this case, there was anotherreport ﬁled by one Ram Pal at the same police station, almost exactly at the same time, relating to the sameincident. This is Ex. P-16 on the record. This report is said to have been lodged at the police station at 12-15 in thenight, while the other report is said to have been lodged at 12-10 that night. The report, Ex. P-16, alleged thepresent prosecution party to be the aggressors and put forward, as the occasion for the incident, an attempt onthe part of the prosecution party to beat Ram Pal, the com- plainant of that complaint, for having given evidencein support of the prosecution in the committal proceedings of the rioting case then pending against the presentprosecution witnesses (as accused therein)obviously with a view to prevent him from giving evidence in theSessions Court against them. That complaint speciﬁcally refers to one Ram Bhawan who is P.W. 4 in the presentcase as the person who had a pistol in hand and ﬁred with it. That report makes no mention of any injuries havingbeen by then received from pistol ﬁre, in the course of that incident.Of course, there is no proof, in this case, of any of the allegations in that report. But it appears from the order ofcommitment in this case (which forms part of the present printed record) that with reference to that report therewas pending, at the date of the committal, a cross-case against some of the prosecution witnesses in the presentcase for the same incident. The police constable mohair of the police station where the counter complaint, Ex. P-16 was lodged and who accepted both the complaints (1) from Bhurey Lal, and (2) from Ram Pal, has stated in hisevidence that when the complaint, Ex. P- 16, was ﬁled by Ram Pal the present appellant Suraj Pal had alsoaccompanied Ram Pal, the complainant therein. This may well be claimed to be the conduct of an innocentperson. It is also not without some signiﬁcance 1343 that admittedly and as a matter of fact, the police did not ﬁleany charge-sheet in the present case against any one for the actual oﬀence of murder under section 302, IndianPenal Code and that even in the charge-sheet which they did ﬁle they conﬁned the case to section 307, IndianPenal Code but did not commit themselves as to who out of the members of the unlawful assembly was the authorof the pistol ﬁre. So far as it appears from the police charge- sheet dated the 22nd February, 1953, as printed in therecord before us, there is a statement therein to the eﬀect "" Suraj Pal Singh and Ram Manohar were armed withpistols"".Ram Manohar is also one of the accused who was put up for trial. The statements of some of the prosecutionwitnesses furnish indication of more than one ﬁre-arm having been used at the incident. Thus, for instance.,Bisheshwar, P.W.2, said ""I heard 3 or 4 guns being ﬁred outside and also heard a noise"". P.W. 4., Ram Bhawan, said "" We four personsthrew lumps of earth from the well at the accused persons, the accused retired and ﬁred their gun twice........................ The accused had ﬁred a gun from the door of Mabadeo when going away, then, bad ﬁred two or three gunsfrom his door"". P.W. 5, Gaya Prasad, said "" Two or three guns afterwards had been ﬁred from the door of MahadeoPandit. Those guns had been ﬁred from the lane.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/10./959519533rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html56 9/12/ 2020SURAJ PAL V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [15] INSC 10; AIR 15 SC 49; 15 (1) SCR 12 (1 Mah 15)The guns had been ﬁred at the door of Ram Saran and had bit it"". All these witnesses no doubt assert that so far asthe particular injuries with which this case is concerned the ﬁring was by the appellant Suraj Pal. But the abovestate- ments by these witnesses in the cross-examination may well indicate that there may have been otherpersons in the unlawful assembly at that time with arms in their hands, who made use of them by ﬁring. Apartfrom the use of pistols in the course of that incident, by one party or the other, there are clear indications thatthere was a mutual ﬁght between both the parties. Two of the persons on the side of the accused, viz. Lal Pratapand Chedi Lal have received some injuries and their injury certiﬁcates have 172 1344 been marked as Exs. D-1 andD-2. The prosecution witnesses themselves admit that there was mutual ﬁghting to this extent, viz. that there wasalso throwing of brickbats by the complainant' s party against the rioters. As already stated there is in fact acounter case against some of the present prosecution witnesses in respect of the same incident. In such a situationany further trial is likely to result only in very doubtful and unreliable evidence being adduced after a considerablelapse of time. Even as it is, the evidence recorded in the present case has been found by the High Court in itsjudgment as not acceptable at its face value. The learned Judges have dealt with this aspect at length and theywound up their consideration of this part of the case as follows:"" For the above reasons, I am of opinion that there is a good deal of substance in this part of the arguments of theappellants' counsel. The question that would arise is as to which of the particular accused is guilty and what shouldbe the criterion for deciding this matter. In view of the biassed and interested nature of the prosecution evidence, Iam of opinion that the presence of only those accused should be held to have been proved who have beenassigned any deﬁnite part by the prosecution witnesses or ,whose presence is corroborated by some othercircumstantial evidence. In view of the highly interested nature of the prosecution evidence, dealing with the ﬁrstaspect of the case also, viz. the question as to how far the prosecution have succeeded in proving the manner inwhich the incident occurred, 1 have not accepted the prosecution case unless it found corroboration from someother factor of a circumstantial nature or from probabilities of the case"".It is by reference to these standards that they have rejected the evidence of the prosecution witnesses in so far asthey implicated ten other accused whom the High Court acquitted. But it appears to us, that judged by the verysame standards there is no adequate reason for accepting the evidence as being reliable in respect of thisappellant also. In fact there is good reason to feel that on the same standards this appel- 1345 lant also should havegot the beneﬁt of the doubt. At this stage, it is not out of place to mention one fact. It appears from the evidenceof the Investigating Oﬃcer, P.W.14, that in the course of the investigation the prosecuting authorities were of the opinion that the murder in thiscase was to be attributed to the prosecution witness, Ram Bhawan, P.W. 4, and not to the appellant, and that intheir view even the evidence as against Ram Bhawan was not suﬃcient to put him on trial for the murder.Doubtless such an opinion of the prosecuting authorities has no relevancy in the case and should not have beenplaced on the record in this case. But when we have to consider the desirability or otherwise of retrial, we need notshut our eyes to these features of the case which have been brought on the record.In the circumstances mentioned above we do not consider that the interests of justice require that any retrialshould be ordered. We accordingly direct that there shall be no retrial.In the result, the convictions of the appellant under sections 307 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code and thesentences therefor are hereby set aside. But his conviction under section 148 of the Indian Penal Code ismaintained as also the sentence of two years and a half in respect thereof. This appeal is accordingly allowedpartially to the extent indicated above.Appeal partially allowed."

C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (G. N. Joshi, PorUs A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale, with him), for theappellant.J. B. Dadachanji, M. V. Jayakar and Rajinder Narain, for respondent No. 1.1955. March 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 1347 SINHA J.-This is an appeal by special leave fromthe orders dated the 28th September 1951 passed by the 2nd respondent, the Authority appointed under section15(1) of the Payment of Wages Act (IV of 1936), (which hereinafter will be referred to as the Act) allowing the 1strespondent' s claim for house rent allowance as part of his wages.In this case the facts are not in dispute and may shortly be stated as follows: The 1st respondent is a gangman inthe employ of the Central Railway (which previously used to be known as the G.I.P. Rly.), since April 1945. At thattime his wages were Rs. 18 per month plus dearness allowance.With eﬀect from the 1st November 1947 the Railway Board under the Ministry of Railways of the Government ofIndia introduced a scheme of grant of compensatory (city) allowance and house rent allowance at rates speciﬁed intheir memorandum No. E47 CPC/14. This scheme was modiﬁed by the Railway Board' s letter No. E47 CPC/14dated 1st December 1947. As a result of this scheme certain railway employees stationed at speciﬁed headquarterswere eligible for the allowance aforesaid at certain speciﬁed rates. The 1st respondent thus became entitled to theallowance of Rs.10 per month. This allowance the 1st respondent drew along with his salary until the 18th August 1948 when hewas oﬀered by the Government, quarters suitable to his post, but he refused to occupy the same. On his refusal tooccupy the quarters oﬀered by the Government, the house rent allowance was stopped with eﬀect from the 19thAugust 1948.On the 8th June 1951 the 1st respondent put in his claim before the Authority for Rs. 290 on the ground that theappellant, the Divisional Engineer, G.I.P. Ry., who was the authority responsible under section 4 of the Act forpayment of wages, had stopped payment of house rent allowance to him from the 19th August 1948. The claimcovered the period the 19th August 1948 to the 18th January 1951 at the rate of Rs.10 per month. The appellant appeared before the Authority and by his written statement contested the claim onthe ground that the house rent allowance which was 1348 the subject matter of the claim was not "" wages"" withinthe meaning of section 2(vi) of the Act. It was, therefore, submitted by the appellant who was the opposite partybefore the Authority that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim which should be dismissed in limine. It wasfurther pleaded that the claim was inadmissible on the ground that there had been no illegal deduction from therespondent' s wages inasmuch as the respondent had been allotted railway quarters of a suitable type and as hehad refused to occupy those quarters he was not entitled under the rules to any house rent allowance.Alternatively, it was further pleaded by the appellant that so much of the claim as, related to a period preceding sixmonths immediately before the date of the application was time-barred under the ﬁrst proviso to section 15(2) ofthe Act.' The Authority condoned the delay and that part of the order condoning the delay is not in controversybefore us.On the issues thus joined between the parties the Authority came to the conclusion that the house rent allowancewas "" wages"" as deﬁned in the Act that as a matter of fact, accommodation was oﬀered to the 1st respondent andhe refused it; but that even so, the appellant was not entitled to withhold the house rent allowance. Accordinglythe claim for Rs. 290 was allowed by the Authority.The short point to be decided in this case is whether the house rent allowance claimed by the 1st respondent camewithin the purview of the deﬁnition of "" wages"" contained in the Act. There being no diﬀerence on questions of factbetween the parties, the answer to the question raised must depend upon the construction to be placed upon thefollowing material portion of the deﬁnition of "" wages"" in section 2(vi) of the Act:- ' Wages' means all remuneration,capable of being expressed in terms of money, which would, if the terms of the contract of employment, expressor implied, were fulﬁlled, be payable, whether conditionally upon the regular attendance, good work or conduct orother behaviour of the person employed or other- 1349 wise, to a person employed in respect of his employmentor of work done in such employment, and includes any bonus or other additional remuneration of the natureaforesaid which would be so payable and any sum payable to such person by reason of the termination of hiswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/11.html/02095959959524 9/12/2THE DIVISIONAL ENGINEER, G.I.P .

The question then arises, what are the terms of the contractbetween the parties. When the 1st respondent' s employment under the railway administration represented by theappellant began, admittedly be was not entitled to any such house rent allowance. As already indicated, thescheme for payment of house rent allowance was introduced with eﬀect from the 1st November 1947 when therules were framed, admittedly under sub-section (2) of section 241 of the Government of India Act, 1935, by theGovernor-General. Those rules were amended subsequently. We are here concerned with the amendment madeby the Railway Board by its letter No.E47CPC/ 14 dated the 1st December 1947, particularly rule 3(i) which is in these terms:- "" The house rent allowancewill not be admissible to those who occupy accommodation provided by Government or those to whomaccommodation has been oﬀered by Government but who have refused it"".It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the terms of the contract between the parties include the rulequoted above and that therefore the position in law is that there is no absolute right in the 1st respondent to claimthe house rent allowance; in other words, it is contended that there is a condition precedent to the claim for houserent allowance being admissible, namely, that the employee should be posted at one of those places, like Bombay,Calcutta, 1350 Madras' etc., before the claim for house rent allowance could arise and that there is a conditionsubsequent, namely, that the employee posted at any one of those places will cease to be entitled to the -allowance if either the Government provides accommodation to the employee in question or the employee-refuses to occupy the accommodation so oﬀered to him. On the other hand, it has been argued on behalf of the1st respondent that the employee' s right to the allowance accrues as soon as he has fulﬁlled the terms of thecontract of employment including regular attendance, good work or conduct and his other behaviour in terms ofthe deﬁnition of "" wages"" as contained in the Act. It was also argued on behalf of the 1st respondent that the termsof the deﬁnition have to be construed consistently with the provisions of sections 7 and 11 of the Act; that rule 3(i)quoted above is inconsistent with some of the terms of the deﬁnition of "" wages"" and the provisions of sections 7and 11 and that in any event, if rule 3(i) aforesaid were to be considered as a part of the terms of the contractbetween the parties, section 23 of the Act prohibits an employee from entering into such a contract as has theeﬀect of depriving him of his vested rights.It should be noted at the outset that the learned Attorney- General appearing on behalf of the appellant has notpressed the argument which appears to have been raised in the written statement of the appellant and also beforethe Authority as would appear from the orders passed by him, that clause (a) excluding ""the value of any houseaccommodation"" clearly showed that house rent allowance was not included in "" wages"" as deﬁned in section 2(vi)of the Act. As will presently appear, this argument proceeds on the unwarranted assumption that house rentallowance is synonymous with the value of any house accommodation referred to in -the deﬁnition of "" wages""in section 7(2)(b) and section 11 of the Act. andThe answer to the question whether house rent allowance is "" wages"" may be in the aﬃrmative if the rules framedby the department relating to the grant of house rent allowance make it compulsory for the 1351 employer togrant house rent allowance without anything more: in other words, if the house rent allowed had been grantedwithout any conditions or with conditions, if any, which were unenforceable in law. But the statutory rules framedby the Government governing the grant of house rent allowance do not make it unconditional and absolute interms. The house rent allowance in the ﬁrst instance is not admissible to all the employees of a particular class.It is admissible only to such railway employees as are posted at speciﬁed places in order ""to compensate railwayservants in certain costlier cities for excessive rents paid by them over and above what they might normally beexpected to pay""; nor is such an allowance ""intended to be a source of proﬁt"" or to be "" an allowance in lieu of freequarters"", as speciﬁcally stated in the preamble to the letter No.E47CPC/14, dated 1st December 1947, issued by the Railway Board. The argument on behalf of the 1st respondentwould have been valid if the rules in terms contemplated the grant of house rent allowance to every employee of aparticular category but the rules do not make the grant in such absolute terms. The house rent allowance isadmissible only so long as an employee is stationed at one of the speciﬁed places and has not been oﬀeredGovernment quarters. The rules distinctly provide that the allowance will not be ad- raissible to those who occupywww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/11.html/02095959959534 9/12/2THE DIVISIONAL ENGINEER, G.I.P . RAIL WAY V. MAHADEO RAGHOO & ANR [15] INSC 11; AIR 15 SC 25; 15 (1) SCR 1…Government quarters or to those to whom such quarters have been oﬀered but who have refused to takeadvantage of the oﬀer. Once an employee of the description given above has been oﬀered suitable houseaccommodation and he has refused it, he ceases to be entitled to the house rent allowance and that allowancethus ceases to be "" wages"" within the meaning of the deﬁnition in the Act, because it is no more payable under theterms of the contract.In our opinion, it is clear beyond all reasonable doubt that the rules which must be included in the terms ofcontract between the employer and the employee contemplate that an employee posted at one 173 1352 of thespeciﬁed places would be entitled to house rent allowance; but that as soon as he is oﬀered Government quartersfor his accommodation, he ceases' to be so entitled., whether he actually occupies or does not occupy the quartersoﬀered to him. Hence the grant of house rent allowance does not create an indefeasible right in the employee atall places wherever he may be posted and in all circumstances, irrespective of whether or not he has been oﬀeredGovernment quarters.But it has been argued on behalf of the respondent that such a conclusion would be inconsistent with theprovisions of sections 7 and 1 1 of the Act. We do not see any such inconsistency. Section 7 of the Act deals withsuch deductions as may be made from the wages as deﬁned in the Act, of an employee. Subsection (2) of section 7categorically speciﬁes the heads under which deductions may lawfully be made from wages. Clause (d) of this sub-section has reference to "" deductions for house accommodation sup- plied by the employer"", and section 11provides that such a deduction shall not be made unless the house accommodation has been accepted by theemployee and shall not exceed the amount equivalent to the value of such accommodation. The deﬁnition of"" wages"" in the Act also excludes from its operation the value of house accommodation referred to in sections 7 andII as aforesaid. The legislature has used the expression "" value of any house accommodation"" in the deﬁnition of"" wages"" as denoting something which can be deducted from "" wages"". The one excludes the other. It is thus clearthat the deﬁnition of "" wages"" under the Act cannot include the value of any house accommodation supplied by theemployer to the employee; otherwise it would not be a legally permissible deduction from wages. It Is equally clearthat house rent allowance which may in certain circumstances as aforesaid be included in "" wages"" is not the samething as the value of any house accommodation referred to in the Act. That being so, there is no validity in theargument advanced on behalf of the 1st respondent that rule 3(i) aforesaid is 1353 inconsistent with the provisionsof sections 7 and 11 of the Act.It remains to consider the last argument advanced on behalf of the 1st respondent that section 23 of the Actprohibits an employee from relinquishing such a right as is the subject matter of rule 3(i) quoted above. Thisargument proceeds on the assumption that house rent allowance which is a right conferred on the employee is anabsolute right.It has already been held above that the Act read along with the rules which constitute the terms of the contractbetween the employer and the employee does not create any absolute right in the employee to the house rentallowance. That being so, there is no question of the employee relinquishing any such right as is contemplated bysection 23.For the reasons aforesaid, the appeal succeeds. The orders passed by the Authority are set aside. In the specialcircumstances of this case there will be no order as to costs.Appeal allowed."

The respondent alleged that he had been paid hisactual wages as ﬁxed by the railway administration but that after the introduction of the scheme of upgrading ofpersons employed under the daily wages scheme, others who were junior to him had been placed on the monthlywages scheme whereas his claim to be so placed, had been ignored and that he had not been paid wages on thescale to which he would have been entitled if he had been placed on the monthly wages scheme.Held, per SINHA J.

The Judgment of Vivian Bose, Venkatarama Ayyar and Sinha JJ. was delivered by Sinha J.Jagannadhadas J. delivered a separate judgment.SINHA J.-This is an appeal by special leave from the order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated the24th August 1951 upholding that of a single Judge of that court sitting on the Original Side, dismissing theappellant' s petition under art. 226 of the Constitution for a writ of certiorari quashing the order dated the 23rdJanuary 1951 passed by the 1st respondent, the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act (hereinafter referredto as the Act).The facts leading up to this appeal may shortly be stated as follows: The 2nd respondent is and has been at allmaterial times an employee of the Central Railway (formerly called the G.I.P. Rly.) represented by the appellantwho has been nominated by the Railway Administration as responsible for payment of wages under section 3 ofthe Act. Ever since 1941, the 2nd respondent has been employed by the Railway Administration as a carpenter ondaily wages, and has been treated as a daily rated casual labourer and has been paid his wages at the rate of Rs. 3-4-0 per day. He continued receiving his wages at that rate until October,, 1949 without any demur, and grantingreceipts for the wages thus received. On the 2nd December, 1949 an application was made by one K. N. Pitkar "" anoﬃcial of Registered Trade Union, a person 1356 permitted by the Authority"" under sub-section (2) of section 15 ofthe Payment of Wages Act, 1936, against the G.I.P. Ry.administration through its Divisional Engineer, Parel, Bombay. It was alleged on behalf of the 2nd respondent thathis wages due in respect of six months from May to October 1949 amounting to Rs. 245 had not been paid or hadbeen subjected to illegal deductions as shown in the schedule.The schedule will be set out hereinafter. A claim for Rs.245 plus Rs. 15 by way of compensation was made.The appellant, as the opposite party before the Authority, resisted the claim, inter alia, on the grounds- (1) that Rs.245 had not been illegally deducted from the wages of the 2nd respondent; and (2) that the claim of the 2ndrespondent who was employed as a daily rated casual labourer on speciﬁed daily wages, to be placed on apermanent cadre on the scale of monthly rates of pay was unfounded.It was further alleged that the 2nd respondent did not come within the purview of the Railway Services (Revisionof Pay) Rules as he was a daily rated casual labourer charged to works and that no rules had been laid downgoverning the rates of pay and the conditions of service of daily rated casual laborers like the 2nd respondent.Hence his terms of service were the daily wages paid to him all along. It was thus contended that there had been.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/12.h/020959519535rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml27 9/12/2A.V. D'COSTA V . B. C. PA TEL & ANR [15] INSC 12; AIR 15 SC 42; 15 (1) S CR 13 (4 Mah 15)no deduction from his wages. In this connection reference was made to the award of the Railway WorkersClassiﬁcation Tribunal, dated the 28th May 1948.The Authority by its orders dated the 23rd January 1951 decided that the position of the 2nd respondent was notthat of a casual labourer but that of a ""temporary employee "" and that therefore he was entitled to be on the scaleof Rs. 55- 150 plus the allowances admissible. In coming to this conclusion the Authority observed that the workdone by the 2nd respondent is of the same nature as that of a member of the permanent staﬀ. Hence the 2ndrespondent could not be called a casual labourer. It also made reference to 1357 article 39 (d) of the Constitutioncontaining the direction that there should be equal pay for equal work. The Authority also negatived thecontention raised on behalf of the appellant that the question of classiﬁcation of an employee was outside itsjurisdiction. In pursuance of the said order the Authority allowed the 2nd respondent' s application by its furtherorders dated the 2nd March 1951.Against the said orders of the Authority the appellant moved the High Court of Judicature at Bombay by anapplication under article 226 of the Constitution for quashing the aforesaid orders. The matter was heard in theﬁrst instance by a learned single Judge of that court who by his orders dated the 19th June 1951 dismissed theapplication.The appellant preferred an appeal under the Letters Patent which was heard by a Division Bench of that court. TheDivision Bench by its order dated the 24th August 1951 dismissed the appeal and agreed with the conclusions ofthe Judge on the Original Side that the Authority had not acted without jurisdiction or had not exceeded itsjurisdiction in entertaining the 2nd respondent' s application. On the appellant' s application for leave to appeal tothis court being rejected by the High Court, the appellant moved this court and obtained special leave to appeal onthe 2nd February 1953.The main controversy between the parties in this court is whether, having regard to the relevant provisions of theAct, the 1st respondent was competent to pass the orders it did, which orders had been upheld by the High Courtof Bombay.The Authority set up under section 15 of the statute in question is undisputably a tribunal of limited jurisdiction.Its power to hear and determine disputes must necessarily be found in the provisions of the Act. Such a tribunal, itis undoubted,, cannot determine any controversy which is not within the ambit of those provisions. On examiningthe relevant provisions of the Act it will be noticed that it aims at regulating the payment of wages to certainclasses of persons employed in industry. It applies 1358 in the ﬁrst instance to the payment of wages to personsemployed in any factory or employed by a railway administration; but the State Government has the power aftergiving three months notice to extend the provisions of the Act or any of them to the payment of wages to any classof persons employed in any class or group of industrial establishments. "" Wages"" means- "" all remuneration,capable of being expressed in terms of money, which would, if the terms of the contract of employment, expressor implied, were fulﬁlled, be payable........ to a person employed in respect of his employment or of work done insuch employment...."" (omitting words not necessary for our present purpose).Section 3 lays down that every employer or his re- presentative or nominee shall be responsible for the payment topersons employed by him of all wages Section' s provides for ﬁxation of "" wage-periods' which shall not exceed onemonth in any case. Section 5 indicates the last date within which, with reference to the particular wage-period,wages shall be paid. Section 7 lays down that the wages of an em- ployed person shall be paid to him withoutdeductions of any kind except those authorized by or under the Act. Section 7(2) in clauses (a) to (k) speciﬁes theheads under which deductions from wages may be made, namely, ﬁnes; deductions for absence from duty;deductions for damage to or loss of goods of the employer; deductions for house accommodation supplied by theemployer; deductions for amenities and services supplied by the employer; deductions for recovery of advances orfor adjustment of overpayments of wages;deductions of income-tax payable by the employee; deductions to be made under orders of a court or othercompetent authority; deductions for subscriptions to, and for repayment of advances from any provident fund;deductions for payments to cooperative societies, etc.; and ﬁnally, deductions made with the concurrence of theemployed person in furtherance of certain schemes approved by Government.No other deductions are permissible. It is also laid 1359 down that every payment made by the employed person tothe employer or his ' agent shall be deemed to be deduction from wages. Each of the several heads of deductions.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/12.h/020959519535rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml37 9/12/2A.V. D'COSTA V . B. C. PA TEL & ANR [15] INSC 12; AIR 15 SC 42; 15 (1) S CR 13 (4 Mah 15)aforesaid is dealt with in detail in sections 8 to 13. Section 8 lays down the conditions and limits subject to whichﬁnes may be imposed and the procedure for imposing such ﬁnes. It also requires a register of such ﬁnes to bemaintained by the person responsible for the payment of wages. Section 9 deals with deductions on account ofabsence from duty and prescribes the limits and the proportion thereof to wages.Section 10 similarly deals with deductions for damage or loss to the employer and the procedure for determiningthe same. Like section 8, this section also requires a register of such deductions and realizations to be maintainedby the person responsible for the payment of wages. Section 11 lays down the limits of deductions for houseaccommodation and other amenities or services which may have been accepted by the employee, subject to suchconditions as the State Government may impose. Section 12 lays down the conditions subject to which deductionsfor recovery of advances may be made from wages. Finally section 13 provides that the deductions for payment toco-operative societies and insurance schemes shall be subject to such conditions as the State Government mayprescribe. Section 14 makes -provision for the appointment of Inspectors for carrying out the purpose of the Act,with power to enter on any premises and to examine any registers or documents relating to the calculation orpayment of wages and to take evidence on the spot. His function is to see that the registers or documentsprescribed by the Act containing the necessary entries as regards deductions and other matters have beenproperly kept by the employers or their agents in order to be able to ascertain whether any deductions from wagesin excess of the provisions of sections 7 to 13 aforesaid have been made. We then come to section 15 which makesprovision for the appointment of the Authority ""to hear and decide for any speciﬁed area all claims arising out ofdeductions from the wages, or delay in payment of 174 1360 the wages of persons employed or paid in that area ""Where the Authority ﬁnds that any deduction has been made from the wages of an employed person or thepayment of any wages had been delayed, he may at the instance of the wage-earner himself or any legalpractitioner or any oﬃcial of a registered trade union authorized in writing to act on his behalf, or any Inspectorunder the Act or any other person acting with the permission of the Authority, after making such enquiry as hethinks ﬁt and after giving an opportunity to the person responsible for the payment of wages under section 3 toshow cause, direct the refund to the employed person of the amount deducted or the payment of delayed wagestogether with such compensation as he may determine. The section also lays down the limits and conditions of hispower to direct payment of compensation to the employed person or of penalty to the employer, if he is satisﬁedthat the application made on behalf of an employee was either malicious or vexatious. His determination is ﬁnalsubject to a very limited right of appeal under section 17. Section 18 vests the Authority with all the powers of acivil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, for the purpose of taking evidence, of enforcing the attendance ofwitnesses and of compelling the production of documents. Section 22 lays down that no court shall entertain anysuit in respect of wages or of deduction from wages in so far as the claim forms the subject matter of a pendingproceeding under the Act or has formed the subject of a direction in favour of or against the plaintiﬀ under section15, or which could have been recovered by the application under that section. Section 26 empowers the StateGovernment to make rules to regulate the procedure to be followed by the authorities and courts referred to insections 15 and 17 and provides that rules may be made inter alia, requiring the maintenance of records, registers,returns and notices necessary under the Act and the display in a conspicuous place of notices specifying the ratesof wages payable to persons employed on such premises; and prescribing the authority for making a list of 1361acts and omissions in respect of which ﬁnes may be imposed and the procedure for imposing such ﬁnes..We have set out above in some detail the relevant provisions of the Act in order to point out that those provisionsare not applicable to the complaint made in the present case.In this connection it is necessary to set out in extenso the "" particulars of claim""application which are as follows: in the schedule appended to his"" The applicant is working as a carpenter-mason with the opposite party under I.O.W., Byculla. According to theorders on introduction of the prescribed scales, the Railway Administration has to make the staﬀ working underI.O.W. on permanent monthly wages scheme under the rules of the prescribed scales. The applicant along withothers was up till now under daily wages scheme. About 20 posts under I.O.W. where the applicant is working wereto be made per- manent. The opposite party in supersession of claim of the applicant has conﬁrmed his juniors onthe permanent scales as a skilled workman in the scale of 55-3-85-4-125-5-130, whereas the opposite partycontinued to pay the applicant on daily wages scheme thus depriving him of his legitimate wages under theprescribed scale, which resulted in the monetary loss to the applicant of Rs. 40-13-4 per month.Notice on behalf of the applicant was served on this count on the opposite party but of no avail and hence thisapplication.

D'COSTA V . B. C. PA TEL & ANR [15] INSC 12; AIR 15 SC 42; 15 (1) S CR 13 (4 Mah 15)There is no allegation of delay in payment of wages inasmuch as it is not the respondent' s case that his wageswere not paid within the time limit laid down in section 5; nor are there allegations to show that any paymentshave been made by the employed person to the employer or his agent which could be deemed to be a deductionfrom his wages within the meaning of section 7. None of the categories of deductions as laid down in section 7have been referred to. In other words, it is not alleged that his Wages 1362 were so much and that so much hadbeen deducted under any of the heads set out under section 7(2). The allegations made by the respondent onlyamount to saying that he had been paid his actual wages as ﬁxed by the railway administration but that after theintroduction of the scheme of upgrading of persons employed under the daily wages scheme, others who werejunior to him had been placed on the monthly wages scheme whereas his claim to be so placed had been ignored.The respondent' s main grievance, therefore, appears to be that he had not been paid wages on the scale to whichhe would have been entitled if he had been placed on the monthly wages scheme.In our opinion, the scheme of the Act as set forth above shows that if an employee were to state that his wageswere, say Rs. 100 per month and that Rs. 10 had been wrongly deducted by authority responsible for the paymentof wages that is to say, that the deductions could not come under any one of the categories laid down in section 7(2), that a would be a straight case within the purview of the Act and the authority appointed under section 15could entertain the dispute. But it is said on behalf of the respondent that the authority has the jurisdiction notonly to make directions contemplated by sub-section (3) of section 15 to refund to the employed person anyamount unlawfully deducted but also to ﬁnd out what the terms of the contract were so as to -determine what thewages of the employed person were.There is no diﬃculty in accepting that proposition. If the parties entered into the contract of service, say bycorrespondence and the contract is to be determined with reference to the letters that passed between them, itmay be open to the authority to decide the controversy and ﬁnd out what the terms of the contract with referenceto those letters were. But if an employee were to say that his wages were Rs. 100 per month which he actuallyreceived as and when they fell due but that he would be entitled to higher wages if his claims to be placed on thehigher wages scheme had been recognized and given eﬀect to, 1363 that would not in our opinion, be a matterwithin the ambit of his jurisdiction. The authority has the jurisdiction to decide what actually the terms of thecontract between the parties were, that is to say, to determine the actual wages;but the authority has no jurisdiction to determine the question of potential wages. The respondent' s complaint inthe present case comes within the latter illustration. If the respondent' s claim to be placed on the scheme ofhigher wages had been. unduly passed over by the appellant, if indeed he had the power to do so, the obviousremedy of the respondent was to approach the higher authorities of the railway administration by way ofdepartmental appeal or revision; but instead of doing that, he has sought his redress by making his claim beforethe authority under the Act. The question is, has the authority the power to direct the appellant or his superioroﬃcers who may have been responsible for the classiﬁcation, to revise the classiﬁcation so as to upgrade him fromthe category of a daily wageearner to that of an employee on the monthly wages scheme. If the respondent hadbeen on the cadre of monthly wages and if the appellant had withheld his rise in wages to which he wasautomatically entitled, without any orders of his superior oﬃcers, be might justly have claimed the redress of hisgrievance from the authority under the Act, as it would have amounted to an underpayment. But in the presentcase, on the case as made on behalf of the respondent, orders of the superior oﬃcers were necessary to upgradehim from a daily wage-earner to a higher care.The authority under the Act has not been empowered under section 15 to make any such direction to thosesuperior oﬃcers. The appellant is responsible to pay the respondent only such wages as are shown in the relevantregister of wages presumably maintained by the department under the provisions of the Act, but he cannot bedirected to pay the respondent higher wages on the determination by the authority that he should have beenplaced on the monthly wages scheme.In that view of the matter it is not necessary to go 1364 into the merits of the controversy as to what classiﬁcationas adumbrated by the Railway Workers' Classiﬁcation Tribunal, and adopted by the Railway administration, thesecond respondent should have been brought under. If that question were open to determination by the Authority,we would have had to remit the case to the Authority to give a fresh opportunity to the parties to adduce all therelevant evidence and then to come to its ﬁnal conclusions, as it appeared to us during the hearing of the case thatall relevant information had not been placed before the Authority. But, as, in our opinion, that is not a matterwithin its limited jurisdiction, that contingency does not arise..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/12.h/020959519535rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml57 9/12/2A.V.

He claimed that he should have been absorbed as a monthly-rated permanent employeeand that he has been wrongly superseded. His claim to be treated as a permanent employee was apparently notaccepted by the Tribu- nal (the Authority under section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act for Bombay). But it washeld that the position of the applicant is not that of a daily-rated casual labourer but that of a monthly-ratedtemporary employee. His claim was treated and upheld by the Tribunal as one substantially based on the groundthat the Award of the Railway Workers' Classiﬁcation Tribunal in relation to the recommendations of the CentralPay Commission was approved by the Railway Board and directed to be implemented, and that by virtue thereofhe was no longer a mere casual labourer but was entitled to higher wages on the footing of a monthly-ratedlabourer. No question arises that the order of the Tribunal is bad owing to the 1365 variation between the claimmade and the relief granted. As held by the High Court, pleadings in these cases have to be liberally construed.That his claim was understood as having been based on the Award of Railway Workers' Classiﬁcation Tribunal, bythe Railway Authorities themselves, is clear from the statement ﬁled on their behalf in answer to the J. employee' sclaim. Apart from the question of jurisdiction, the defence was two-fold. (1) The applicant being a daily-ratedcasual labourer, charged to works, the directive of the Railway Board did not apply to him. (2) Even if it applied to aperson in the situation of the applicant, he was not entitled to be brought on to the monthly-rates of pay in theskilled grade, without his previously passing a trade test to establish himself as skilled in his trade and he did notpass the test. The Tribunal. on the material referred to by it in its order, came to the conclusion (1) that theapplicant did not fall within the category of workcharged staﬀ, (2) that under the Award of the Railway Workers'Classiﬁcation Tribunal, no trade test was necessary for the applicant who was a carpenter, and (3) that as percertain instructions of the concerned authority, the period of casual labour was to be limited to six months, andthat since this applicant was admittedly a casual labourer under the Railway for a much larger period, i.e. since1941, he became entitled to be treated as a temporary employee and not as a casual labourer and to receive wagesas such. Whether these conclusions are right or wrong is not the question before us. The only question is whetheror not the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to ﬁnd that the applicant was entitled to the emoluments of a monthly-rated temporary employee and not to that of a daily-rated casual labourer, as the result of the order of the RailwayBoard directing implementation of the Award of the Classiﬁcation Tribunal.The jurisdiction of the Tribunal arises under section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (Act IV of 1936)(hereinafter referred to as the Act). The Tribunal is set up to decide "" all claims arising out of deductions from thewages or delay in payment of 1366 wages"". The relief which it is authorised to award,is to direct ""the refund of theamount deducted, or the payment of the wages delayed"". Such a direction made by the Tribunal is ﬁnal, undersection 17 of the Act, subject to the right of appeal provided therein. Under section 22, no suit lies in any court forthe recovery of wages or of any deduction therefrom which could have been recovered by an application undersection 15. However limited this jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and however elaborate the provisions in the Act forthe preparation and display by the employer of the table of wages payable to the employees, and for theinspection thereof by the Factory Inspectors, it cannot be supposed that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is only toenforce the wages so displayed or otherwise admitted. Such a narrow construction would rob the machinery of theAct of a great deal of its utility and would conﬁne its application to cases which are not likely to arise often, in awellordered administration like the Railways. Indeed, I do not gather that such a construction was pressed for,before us, in the arguments. Even a Tribunal of limited jurisdiction, like the one under consideration, mustnecessarily have the jurisdiction to decide, for itself, the preliminary facts on which the claim or dispute before itdepends. In the instant case, it must have jurisdiction to decide what the wages payable are and, for that purpose,what the contract of employment and the terms thereof are. The judgment of my learned brothers in this caseapparently recognizes the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as above stated, when it said that the Tribunal has the powerto ﬁnd out what the terms of the contract were to determine what the wages of the employed person were"".Whether the Tribunal' s decision in this behalf is conclusive or not is a matter that does not arise for decision in thiscase.But, it is said that the Tribunal has no authority to determine the question of "" potential wages"". Undoubtedly aclaim to a higher potential wage cannot be brought in under the category of "" claim arising out of deduction fromthe wages or delay in pay- 1367 ment of the wages"" if that wage depended on the determination by a superiordepartmental or other authority as to whether or not a particular employee is entitled to the higher wage-a.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/12.h/020959519535rc95wwwiiofindirasee95tml67"" 9/12/2A.V.

PA TEL & ANR [15] INSC 12; AIR 15 SC 42; 15 (1) S CR 13 (4 Mah 15)determination which involves the exercise of administrative judgment or discretion or certiﬁcation, and whichwould, in such a situation., be a condition of the payability of the wage. But where the higher wage does notdepend upon such determination but depends on the applica- tion of, and giving eﬀect to, certain rules and orderswhich, for this purpose, must be deemed to be incorporated in the contract of employment, such a wage is, in myview, not a prospective wage, merely because the paying authority concerned makes default or commits error inworking out the application of the rules. In this context it is relevant to notice that the deﬁnition of "" wages"" in theAct is "" all remuneration which would if the terms of the contract, express or implied, were fulﬁlled, be payable"".The word "" were"" in this deﬁnition which I have underlined, seems to indicate that even a "" prospective wage"" whichwould be payable on the proper application of the rules in the sense which I have explained above may well fallwithin its scope.he wage under the Act is not, necessarily, the immediately pre-existing wage but the presently-payable wage.In the case before us, the order of the Tribunal proceeded on the view that the applicant was presently entitled tobe treated as a monthly-rated temporary employee and not as a daily-rated casual labourer, by virtue of thedirections of the Railway Board for the implementation of the scheme of classiﬁcation and that therefore he wasentitled to the appropriate higher wage. We have not been shown any material to indicate that this higherclassiﬁcation of the applicant depended not on the mere application, of the classiﬁcation scheme and the rulesthereunder, to him but upon any determination by a departmental higher authority.If it was the latter, undoubtedly the Tribunal cannot claim to sit in judgment over that determination, whether itwas right or wrong. Such 175 1368 determination, if wrong, could be corrected only by a further departmentalappeal, if any, available. But the Tribunal had, to my mind, the authority to ﬁnd whether the applicant' s case fallswithin the scope of determination by the departmental authority or is one of mere application of the rules to thefacts of this case. If the decision of the Tribunal in this behalf was wrong, the appropriate remedy for the RailwayAuthority was by way of an appeal under section 17 of the Act. Since the ﬁnding of the Tribunal in this caseinvolved the case of as many as six persons and the net additional amount ordered was a sum of Rs. 1,341, itsﬁnding was appealable under section 17 of the Act.Whether or not an employee was entitled to wages of a higher category than what he was till then drawing woulddepend entirely on the scope of the rules with reference to which he is entitled to become one in the highercategory and it cannot be assumed a priori that such a claim is a claim to "" prospective wages"".In my view, therefore, there is no suﬃcient reason to reverse the judgment of the learned Judges of the BombayHigh Court and this appeal should be dismissed with costs.BY THE COURT. In accordance with the decision of the majority, the appeal is allowed and the orders of theAuthority and of the High Court are quashed. There will be no order as to costs throughout.Appeal allowed."

Section 84 in so far as it relates tothe constitution of a special bench where one of the parties belongs to a place outside the State of U. P. is ultravires. Hence no competent bench could be constituted under s. 49 of the Act for the trial of the present case inwhich there were three accused one of whom was a person belonging to a diﬀerent State.Under the circumstances the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts was not excluded.Exclusion of jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction, can be brought about by the setting up of a court oflimited jurisdiction, in respect of the limited ﬁeld, only if the vesting and the exercise of that limited jurisdiction isclear and operative.The bar under s. 55 of the Act relates to the case as a whole and has reference to the entire proceeding in respectof all the accused together.","Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 1954.1446 Appeal under Article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution from the Judgment and Order dated the 27th October 1953of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Reference No. 121 of 1953.K. P. Gupta and A. D. Mathur, for the appellant.K. B. Asthana and C. P. Lal, for the respondent.1955. March 15. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal by leavegranted by the High Court of Allahabad presumably under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution. The facts aresimple. Three persons including the appellant were, at the material time, parcel porters at the railway stationManikpur in the district Banda of Uttar Pradesh. On the night of the 18th June, 1952, they were found by twowatchmen of the Watch and Ward staﬀ attached to the railway station, committing theft of certain packets ofbiscuits by breaking open a railway parcel containing those packets, which as parcel porters, they had occasion tohandle. First information of the same was lodged, before the Sub-Inspector, Railway Police, by one Ram Prasad,Head Watchman. The Railway Police ﬁled the charge-sheet under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code on the 20thJune, 1952. The case was taken cognizance of by the Railway Magistrate, Manikpur. All the three accused pleadedguilty. They were convicted by the Magistrate on the 15th July, 1952, and sentenced to a ﬁne of Rs. 25 each.Against this conviction the present appellant ﬁled a revision to the Sessions Judge of Banda. It is necessary at thisstage to mention that under the U. P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1947, the Panchayati Adalats in U. P. have criminaljurisdiction in certain matters. The point taken before the Sessions Judge was that by virtue of the said Act, thepresent case should have been tried by the Panchayati Adalat and that the Railway Magistrate had no jurisdiction.This contention was accepted by the ' learned Sessions Judge. He accordingly made a reference to the High Courtfor quashing the conviction 1447 and sentence. It came before a Single Judge of the High Court who did not feelquite satisﬁed that the Railway Magistrate had jurisdiction. But without deciding the question one way or theother, he declined to accept the reference on the ground that the revisional jurisdiction of the High. Court was J.discretionary. Somewhat -' curiously however, the learned Judge granted a certiﬁcate against his own judgmentthat the case is a ﬁt one for appeal to the Supreme Court. If the learned Judge thought ﬁt to grant leave to appeal,he might well have himself decided the question involved so that we should have had the beneﬁt of hisconsideration of the same.To decide the question of jurisdiction thus raised it is necessary to notice the scheme of the U. P. Panchayat RajAct, 1947 (U.P. Act XXVI of 1947) (here in after referred to as the Act) and a few relevant sections of the same. Itmay be mentioned that the Act appears to have undergone some amendments in the year 1952 and recently in1955. These amendments have no application to the present case. Under the Act, as it stood at the time of thecommission of the oﬀence- and the conviction there for, the scheme thereunder is as follows: Under section 3, theState Government shall, by notiﬁcation in the oﬃcial Gazette, establish a Gaon Sabha for every village or group ofvillages. Under section 42, the State Government or the prescribed authority shall divide a district into circles, eachg/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/IEHTT95NS95395C44arc95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS954.html25 9/12/ 2020BHM SN V.

The StateGovernment shall also establish Panchayati Adalats for each, such circle, provided that the areas of Gaon Sabhaswithin each circle shall, as far as possible, be contiguous. Under section 43, every Gaon Sabha in a circle shall electﬁve adults of prescribed qualiﬁcation permanently residing within its jurisdiction to act as Panches in thePanchayati Adalat of that circle.The Panches so elected by all the Gaon Sabhas in a circle shall form a panel. Under section 44 all the Pancheselected under section 43 shall elect from among themselves a person who is able to record proceedings and to act,185 1448 as Sarpanch of the Panchayati Adalat. As will be seen from the subsequent sections the PanchayatiAdalat has jurisdiction to deal with all disputes and cases, both civil and criminal, arising within its area but it isenough for the present case to notice only those -portions which relate to criminal jurisdiction Section 52(1)provides that certain speciﬁed ;Oﬀences if committed within the jurisdiction of a Panchayati Adalat (which in thiscontext must be taken to refer to local jurisdiction) shall be cognizable by such Panchayati Adalat. The clauses ofsub- section (1) of section 52 specify the various classes of oﬀences under the Indian Penal Code and under someother special and local Acts which are within the cognizance of the Panchayati Adalat. Section 379, Indian Penal,Code, is one of the; sections, so enumerated and it is speciﬁcally provided that the jurisdiction of the Adalat inrespect of this oﬀence is only where the theft of the stolen property does not exceed Rs. 50. ' Section 51(1) providesthat not with stand anything contained in the Code of Criminal Pro- cedure, 1898, every case instituted under theAct shall be instituted before the Sarpanch of the Panchayati Adalat of the circle in which the oﬀence iscommitted. It is also provided under section 55 that no court shall take cognizance of any case which is cognizableunder the Act by the Panchayati Adalat unless an ' Order has been passed by a Sub-Divisional Magistrate undersection. 85. Section 851 authorises a Sub-Divisional Magistrate, on an -application of a party or on his own motion,to cancel the jurisdiction of the Panchayati Adalat with regard to any pending case if there is an apprehension ofmiscarriage of justice. Section 49 provides the machinery for the trial of ' Cases by the formation of benches to dealwith the same. It is necessary to set out the whole of that section in so far as it relates to criminal cases and it is asfollows:"" 49. (1) The Sarpanch shall, for the trial of every case, form a bench of ﬁve Panches from the panel (the panelreferred to: in section 43 above noticed). provided that at least one of the Panches in the bench 1449 shall be aperson who is able to record evidence and proceedings.(2) Every such bench shall include one Panch who resides in the area of the Gaon Sabha -in which the complainantof a case resides and likewise one Panch in the area in which the accused resides and J. three Panches residing inthe area of the Gaon Sabha in which neither party resides, provided that in police cases -one Panch shall be such asmay be residing in the Gaon Sabha in which the oﬀence was committed, one Panch residing in the area of GaonSabha in which the accused resides and three Panches residing in the areas other than those mentioned above.(3)......................................................................(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the State Government may, by rules, prescribe theconstitution of special benches for' determining any dispute arising between any parties or Gaon Sabhas ordiﬀerent circles ' or for any other purpose"".One of the rules framed with reference to this subsection which is relevant for the present purpose is rule 84 and isas follows:"" For the purposes of trial or decision of any case or proceeding parties of which are residents of diﬀerent circles ordiﬀerent districts or any one of the parties is a resident of a place not governed by the Act, the prescribed authorityhaving jurisdiction over the Panchayati Adalat in which a case or proceeding is instituted or transferred for disposalshall constitute a special bench consisting of Panches of the said Panchayati Adalat and if convenient and possiblemay include a Panch of the other circle and shall appoint one of them as Chairman of the bench unless theSarpanch is a member of it"".The question of jurisdiction arises with reference to ' the above provisions of the Act. The charge-sheet ﬁled by thepolice shows that the theft of the property involved in the case is Rs. 3. There can also be no doubt that the oﬀencehas been committed within the limits of Manikpur. It would appear, therefore, prima 1450 facie that by virtue ofsections 51 and 52, the Panchayati Adalat of Manikpur had jurisdiction to try the case. If so, the jurisdiction of theregular Magistrate would appear to be barred under section 55 of the Act, since it is,not suggested that there hasbeen any order under section 85.g/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/IEHTT95NS95395C44arc95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS954.html35 9/12/ 2020BHM SN V. TE SAE OF U. P [ 15] IC 14; AIR 15 SC 45; 15 (1) SR 14 (15 Mh 15)But there is a serious diﬃculty in the way of the exercise of this jurisdiction by the Adalat.The jurisdiction of the Adalat to try any criminal case has to be exercised by a bench of the Panches to be formedby the Sarpanch under section 49 of the Act. The bench has to consist of ﬁve Panches of whom one is to be of theGaon Sabha of Manikpur (since the oﬀence was committed in that place and this is a police case) and anotherbelonging to the Gaon Sabha of the accused and the other three from Gaon Sabhas outside the above two. Wherethere is only one accused and that accused belongs to an area within Uttar Pradesh for which a Gaon Sabha hasbeen formed under the Act or where there are more than one accused all belonging to the area of the same GaonSabha, the constitution of a bench of the Panchayati Adalat for the trial of such a case presents no diﬃculty. But inthe present case it is on the record that one-out of the three accused by name Tulsi belongs to Jubbalpore inMadhya Pradesh. It was, therefore, not possible to constitute a bench in strict compliance with section 49(2) of theAct to try his case. Recourse had, therefore, to be had to section 49(4) and the rules framed thereunder. Therelevant rule 84 (which has been quoted above) no doubt provides for the constitution of special benches to trycases where there are more than one accused who are residents of diﬀerent areas. Now this rule in so far as itprovides for cases wherein all the parties concerned are residents.of Uttar Pradesh may be unexception- able. Butwhether it is valid in so far as it provides ' for the exercise of jurisdiction in respect of a resident outside the Statemay be open to argument on more grounds than one. In the present case, it is suﬃcient to consider whether thisportion of the rule is valid, with reference to section 49(4) under which it is 1451 framed. Section 49(4) authorisesthe Government to frame rules for the constitution of special benches ""for determining disputes between partiesof diﬀerent circles or Gaon Sabhas or for any other purpose"". "" Circles or Gaon Sabhas"" mentioned herein hasreference only to circles and Gaon Sabhas constituted.' under the Act. This does not authorise the framing of a rulein so far as it relates to a person belonging to a place outside the State. Nor can the phrase ""for any other purpose""in sub-section (4) of section 49 whatever that may mean-be construed so widely as to authorise a rule aﬀectingsuch an outsider, assuming without deciding, that a statutory provision by a State Legislature can, directly or bydelegation and in terms, validly provide for the exercise of such jurisdiction by a Panchayati Adalat. We are clearlyof the opinion that rule 84 in so far as it relates to the constitution of a special bench where one of the partiesbelongs to a place outside the State is ultra vires. Hence no competent bench could be constituted under section49 of the Act for the trial of the present case in which there are three accused of whom one is a person belongingto a diﬀerent State.Now, in these circumstances, it has to be considered whether the trial of this case by the ordinary criminal Court isbarred. The bar of the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal Court is brought about by section 55 of the Act.But it requires to be noticed that the bar which is brought about by the section, is a bar which relates to the case asa whole. Because, in, terms, what it says is "" no court shall take cognizance of any case which is cognizable underthe Act by a Panchayati Adalat"". Under section 2(a) of the Act a "" case"" is deﬁned as meaning "" criminal proceedingin respect of an oﬀence triable by a Panchayati Adalat "" and "" Panchayati Adalat"" is deﬁned as ""including a benchthereof "". It is clear, therefore, that this bar has reference to the entire proceeding, i.e., as involving all the accusedtogether. Such a bar in. respect of the entire case can be operative only where there is a valid machinery for thetrial thereof. In the present case in which at ' least one of the accused 1452 (though not this very. appellant) is aperson coming from an area outside the local extent of the Act, any -bench of the Adalat that can be validlyformed there-. under cannot try the three accused together and hence can have no Jurisdiction over the wholecase. The jurisdiction of the regular criminal court in respect of such a case cannot be taken away by the operationof section 55 of the Act. It is to be remembered that the jurisdiction of the criminal courts under section 5 of theCode of Criminal Procedure is comprehensive. That section enjoins, that all oﬀences under the Indian Penal Codeshall be investigated, enquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with "" according ' to the provisions hereinaftercontained"". To the extent that no valid machinery is set up under the U.P. Panchayat Raj' Act for the trial of anyParticular case, the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal court under section 5 Code of Criminal Procedure cannotbe held to have been excluded. Exclusion of jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction, can be brought about bythe setting no of a court of limited jurisdiction, in respect of the limited ﬁeld, only if the vesting and the exercise ofthat limited jurisdiction is clear and operative. Where, as in this case, there is no adequate machinery for theexercise of this jurisdiction in a speciﬁc case, we -cannot hold that the exercise of jurisdiction in respect of such acase by the Court of general jurisdiction is illegal.We are, therefore, of the opinion that the Railway Magistrate had the jurisdiction to try the case.The appeal is accordingly dismissed.Appeal dismissed.g/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/IEHTT95NS95395C44arc95www.liiofindia.oraseeNS954.html45 9/12/ 2020BHM SN V.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA J.-This is an appeal by special leave againstthe orders of the Lucknow Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India (hereinafter to be referred to as ""TheAppellate Tribunal"") dated the 31st August 1953, setting aside the award dated the 13th October 1952 made by theChairman, Central Government Industrial Tribunal, Calcutta (herein- after to be referred to as ""The Tribunal"")reinstating the appellant as the head cashier with back salary under the Punjab National Bank (hereinafter called""The Bank"").The facts leading up to this appeal may shortly be stated.The appellant started his service as the head cashier in the Una Branch of the Bank on the 18th June 1949. TheCash Department of the Bank is in charge of Treasurers. The relation between the Bank and the Treasurers isevidenced by an agreement dated the 1st May 1944 (Ex. 1) which will be noticed in detail hereinafter. That was anagreement between the Bank and ""Messrs Rai Bahadur Karam Chand Puri & Bros"". That ﬁrm was appointed theTreasurers at the head oﬃce of the Bank and other places in and outside the Punjab. On the 28th September 1951the District Manager of the Northern Circle of the. Bank wrote a letter (Ex. 4) to the Treasurers informing 1420them that it had been decided to close the Una oﬃce of the Bank with eﬀect from the close of business on the 3rdNovember 1951. In pursuance of that letter the Treasurers intimated by a letter dated 2nd October 1951 enclosinga copy of Ex. 4 to the appellant that the Una Branch of the Bank will cease to function from the close of businesson the 3rd November 1951 and that his services will not be required after that date. The Punjab National Bank Em-ployees' Union (Punjab) took up the cause of the appellant as also that of other employees and maderepresentations to the Government of India. The Government of India by a notiﬁcation No. SRO-432 dated the 8thMarch 1952 published in the Gazette of India, Part II-Sec. 3, in exercise of its powers under section 10 of theIndustrial Disputes Act XIV of 1947 (hereinafter called the Act) referred the industrial dispute between the Bankand its workmen named in schedule 2 (concerning workers dismissed) and schedule 3 (relating to workerstransferred) for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal at Calcutta constituted under section 7 of the Act.Schedule 1 in so far as it is necessary for purposes of this case contains the following points of dispute between theemployer and the workmen:- ""1. Wrongful dismissal of the workmen mentioned in schedule II and theirreinstatement.""2. In the event of any order for reinstatement payment of wages and other allowances from the date of dismissalto the date of reinstatement"".The appellant is No. 5 in schedule 2 aforesaid. The 'Tribunal gave its award on the 13th October 1952 in respect of anumber of employees whose cases were actually in controversy before it. It is only necessary to refer to the awardin so far as it concerned the appellant. After overruling the preliminary objection of the Bank that the Union bad nolocus standi to represent the appellant the Tribunal formulated the following point for its decision:- ""On merits themain point involved is as to whether the services of an employee of the Cash 1430 Department can be terminatedon a change made in the services of the Contractor Cashier"".It answered this point in these words:- ""This point has been agitated in more than one case and I have also held inReference No. 3 of 1951 as Chairman of Industrial Tribunal (P. N. Bank dispute) relating to 5 cashiers that theemployees of the Cash Department are the employees of the Bank and not the nominees of the ContractorCashiers so far service conditions are concerned, and I think it will serve no useful purpose to discuss all the legalprecedents cited, more especially when the point has been set at rest by their Lordships of the Supreme Court inCivil Appeal No. 66 of 1952 in the matter of United Commercial Bank Ltd. v. Secretary, U. P. Bank EmPloyees'Union and Others. I am of the opinion that the dismissal of Shri Sharma was wrongful and liable to be set aside.Now the normal remedy is reinstatement and I have no hesitation in allowing the same. He will also be paid hisback salary an allowance from the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement"".Whatever may be the merits of the answer given to the question propounded by the Tribunal, there is no doubtthat the question posed had been wrongly framed. The discharge or dismissal of the appellant had nothing to dowith the change in the personnel of the Treasurers. The appellant's services were dispensed with on the groundthat the Una Branch where he was employed as head cashier being an un- economic unit had to be closed and thattherefore the appellant's services were no more required. The res- pondent's case appears to have been that theﬁrm. known as Messrs R. B. Karam Chand Puri & Bros. have been contractors for the Cash Department of the Bankat the head oﬃce and some of the other oﬃces in the Punjab and beyond; that from time to time agreementsg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/1/95959542rcwww.liiofindia.orasee955.html28 9/12/ 2020SHIVNANDAN SHARMA V. THE PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK LTD. [15] INSC 15; AIR 15 SC 40 4; 15 (1) SCR 17 (15 Ma…were executed between the Bank and the aforesaid ﬁrm; that the last agreement was executed on the 1st May1954 (Ex. 1); that the appellant according to the respondent-Bank was the -nominee of the said ﬁrm, and that hisservices had been dispensed 1431 with by the said ﬁrm whose employee he was and not by the Bank which hadnothing directly to do with the employment of cashiers and other workers in the Cash Department which was incharge of the Treasurers described as ""Contractor Treasurers"". Hence the main question in controversy betweenthe parties was whether the appellant was an employee of the Bank or of the said ""Contractor Treasurers"", whomwe shall call the ""Treasurers"" for the sake of brevity. The Tribunal did not address itself to the determination of thatquestion. This Court also did not discuss and decide the matter in Civil Appeal No. 66 of 1952, but assumed thatcashiers of the Bank were its employees. If that question had been decided by this Court, as the Tribunalerroneously thought this Court had, in Civil Appeal No. 66 of 1952, the controversy would have been at an end.Therefore when the respondent preferred an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal, the Bank at the forefront of itsattack against the award of the Tribunal raised the ground that the Tribunal had not determined the basic questionwhich could have given jurisdiction to the Tribunal to decide the dispute whether the head cashier was anemployee of the Bank or was a nominee of the ""Treasurer"" as contended on behalf of the Bank. The Bank reliedvery strongly before the Appellate Tribunal on the memorandum of agreement (Ex. 1) and the correspondencethat passed between the Bank and the ""Treasurers"" on the one hand and the latter and the appellant before us onthe other (Exs. 2, 3, 4 and 5).The Appellate Tribunal rightly remarked that the Tribunal had recorded no ﬁnding on that basic question and hadassumed that the respondent before it was an employee of the Bank. The Appellate Tribunal took the view thatthe agreement (Ex. 1) was decisive of that question. After referring in great detail to the terms of the agreementthe Appellate Tribunal came to the conclusion that the cashier was not an employee of the Bank but of theTreasurers and that therefore the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to give any relief to the complainant before it. The183 1432 award by the Tribunal was, in the result, set aside and the Bank's appeal allowed.The appellant in this Court through his counsel Shri Chari, argued that the Appellate Tribunal had misinterpretedthe provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act in coming to the conclusion that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction toentertain the dispute simply on the ground that one of the parties to the dispute bad successfully denied therelationship of employer and employee; that the Appellate Tribunal misconceived its functions by basing itsﬁndings on the interpretation of the written agreement between the Bank and its Treasurers when it should havegone into all the relevant facts to determine the substance of the matter;and ﬁnally, that the Appellate Tribunal misdirected itself on the question of the interpretation of the agreementfor coming to the conclusion that the appellant was not an employee of the Bank but was a nominee of the""Treasurers"".It was further argued on behalf of the appellant that the Tribunal having based its decision on its previous awarddated the 16th September 1952 in Reference No. 3 of 1951 between persons more or less in the same position asthe appellant and the respondent-Bank, in the background. of the decision of the previous Tribunals, e.g., theaward of the Conciliation Board presided over by Mr. Justice Bind Basni Prasad of the Allahabad High Court, theaward by the Tribunal presided over by Mr' K. C. Sen, and the award of the All India Industrial Tribunal '(BankDisputes), presided over by Sri S. Panchapagesa Sastri and the award dated the 24th March 1951 in Reference No.20, the award of the Tribunal was really ﬁnal. The argument was that the award of the Tribunal was based onconsiderations of facts and circumstances disclosed in those earlier awards to which the Bank and its cashiers andother employees employed in the Cash Department were parties. It was thus a ﬁnal ﬁnding of fact which was notopen to appeal before the Appellate Tribunal. It was therefore contended that the Appellate Tribunal bad nojurisdiction to entertain the appeal and to reverse the award of the Tribunal.1433 On behalf of the respondent-Bank it was contended that no speciﬁc grounds had been taken either before theAppellate Tribunal or in the memorandum of appeal to this Court that the Appellate Tribunal had no jurisdiction onthe ground now taken by the appellant in this Court, nor was that ground taken in the statement of case. Onmerits it was contended by the respondent's counsel that the Tribunal is as much bound by the rules of evidenceand procedure as any other Tribunal and as the Tribunal had not addressed itself to the question whether thecashier-appellant was an employee of the Bank, the question was open before the Appellate Tribunal which wascompetent to pronounce on that basic question. Finally it was argued that on a true construction of the provisionsof the agreement (Ex. 1) this Court should accept the ﬁnding of the Appellate Tribunal that the appellant was notan employee of the Bank and that on that account the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to grant any relief to theappellant.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/1/95959542rcwww.liiofindia.orasee955.html38 9/12/ 2020SHIVNANDAN SHARMA V. THE PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK LTD. [15] INSC 15; AIR 15 SC 40 4; 15 (1) SCR 17 (15 Ma…On behalf of the respondent the case was practically rested on the construction of the agreement (Ex. 1). Withreference to the terms of the agreement the learned counsel for the respondent argued that the Treasurers werenot servants or employees of the Bank but were ""independent contractors"" and that the appellant and otheremployees in the Cash Department having been nominees of the ""independent contractors"" there could not beany relation of employer and employee between the Bank and the appellant. It is therefore necessary to examinein some detail the terms of the agreement aforesaid. We set out below, underlining important words, the terms ofthe agreement in so far as they are relevant for the determination of the true relation between the Bank and theTreasurers. Though this agreement is dated the 1st May 1944, cl. (1) provides that it will be deemed to havecommenced and come into force from the 15th March 1942, the date of the death of R. B. Karam Chand Puri andwill take the place of the previous agreement dated the 26th July 1941, thus maintaining the continuity of therelationship between the 1434 Bank and the Treasurers'. The agreement provides that the Treasurers shalldiligently and faithfully serve the Bank at the Head Oﬃce and its various oﬃces mentioned in schedule A attachedto and forming part of the agreement and at other oﬃces where they may hereafter be appointed treasurers andshall in all respects diligently and faithfully obey and observe all lawful orders and instructions of the Bank or theperson placed by the Bank in authority over them in relation to the due discharge of their duties as Treasurers. TheTreasurers in addition to the duties, liabilities and responsibilities devolving upon them by virtue of the provisionsof the agreement shall also be liable to perform such duties and discharge such responsibilities as by customusually devolve on treasurers in the employ of a bank. The Treasurers shall be paid for their services aremuneration as mentioned in schedule A aforesaid or such remuneration as the General Board of Directors of theBank may determine from time to time. Out of the remuneration paid to them by 'the Bank the Treasurers shallpay salaries to their nominees employed by them for performing the duties of a cashier in the Bank on their behalfor other functionaries of a similar nature. The salaries of such nominees employed by them will be ﬁxed by theTreasurers themselves but the same will be subject to the approval of the Bank. The remuneration of theTreasurers will be the net amount which will be left to them after paying salaries to their nominees employed bythem for working as cashiers, etc. The Treasurers themselves will not be entitled to any kind of allowances besidesthe net remuneration as aforesaid but their nominees or working cashiers will be entitled to allowances which ,theauthorities of the Bank may sanction for members of the -staﬀ from time to time. The Treasurers shall employ thenumber of men at each oﬃce as mentioned in schedule A aforesaid. The Board of Directors shall have the powerto increase or decrease the number of their nominees for any particular oﬃce and the amount of remunerationﬁxed for that oﬃce. The Treasurers shall be responsible for the due safety, both within and outside the premises ofthe Bank at any 1435 oﬃce placed under their charge, of all money, specie, ornaments, bullion, cash, etc. and ofother valuable documents received by them for and on behalf of the Bank or from the Bank and shall beanswerable to the Bank for all losses occurring either inadvertently or by or through the negligence or misconductof the Treasurers or any of their nominees. The Treasurers shall be entitled to resign the services of the Bank bygiving three calendar months' notice to the Bank. The Bank shall also be entitled to dispense with the Treasurers'services on giving three months' notice In case of gross negligence or misconduct or of any fraud,misappropriation or embezzlement by the Treasurers or any of the nominees in the discharge of ,their duties assuch Treasurers, no notice shall be necessary and the Bank shall have the right to dispense with their servicesforthwith. The Bank shall have the right to take the Treasurers into the service of the Bank after settlement ofremuneration with the Treasurers at any other oﬃce or oﬃces of the Bank. The Treasurers and their nomineesshall obey all the orders, rules and regulations prescribed by the Bank with regard to the discharge of their dutiesby the cashiers as well as with regard to the amount of balance they are allowed to keep with them. It shall be theduty of the cashiers to inform the manager of the Bank as soon as the balance in hand exceeds the prescribed limitand to ask for orders on the point. The Treasurers shall not engage any person as their assistant or peon aboutwhose character, conduct or reliability the manager of the Board of Directors of the Bank may have any objection.The Treasurers shall also arrange that no person under employment absents himself from duty without the writtenpermission of the manager for the time being. If any such employee is absent without leave, or he is turned out onthe objection of the Board or the Manager, the Treasurers shall forthwith appoint a substitute in his place. TheTreasurers shall be responsible for the acts and defaults of all their nominees.The Treasurers and their nominees shall be entitled to traveling allowance according to rates sanctioned by theBoard 1436 of Directors of the Bank. The Treasurers have deposited security of the value of Rs. 15,000/- on whichthey shall be entitled to receive interest at the rate of 31 per cent. per annum. As a further security for the dueperformance of the terms and conditions of the agreement as a cover for loss that may be caused to the -Bank byany act or omission of themselves or any one of their nominees, the Treasurers hypothecated properties as perschedule C attached to and forming part of the agreement. Schedule A aforesaid contains the names of theoﬃces, the monthly remuneration of the Treasurers in respect of each one of those oﬃces separately, net savingsof the Treasurers after paying the salaries of the total number of men including cashiers, etc., as stated againstg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/1/95959542rcwww.liiofindia.orasee955.html48 9/12/ 2020SHIVNANDAN SHARMA V. THE PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK LTD. [15] INSC 15; AIR 15 SC 40 4; 15 (1) SCR 17 (15 Ma…each one of the oﬃces. Apart from the terms set out above bearing on the relation between the Bank and theTreasurers, some of which apply equally to their nominees, the following terms of the agreement bear directly onthe relation between the nominees of the Treasurers, like the appellant, and the Bank. In this connection theagreement provides that the Board of Directors shall have the power to increase or decrease the number of theTreasurers' nominees for any particular oﬃce and the amount of remuneration ﬁxed for that oﬃce. Such nomineesshall be entitled as servants of the Bank to any bonus which may from time to time be declared for the members ofthe staﬀ. The bonus of the Treasurers shall be limited to the amount of their own net remuneration and no further.They shall not be entitled to any bonus to which their cashiers are not eligible under the rules of the Bank.The nominees of the Treasurers shall be entitled to participate as ordinary members of the staﬀ in the providentfund constituted by the Bank. Such nominees shall also be entitled to traveling allowance according to ratessanctioned by the Board of Directors of the Bank whenever they are required to go to out-stations on bankbusiness.From the terms of the agreement aforesaid set out above almost verbatim omitting such clauses and words as arenot relevant to this case, it will appear 1437 that the Treasurers are under the employment of the Bank on amonthly basis for an indeﬁnite term, that is to say, until such time as either party to the agreement terminated it inaccordance with the terms quoted above. They are under the complete control and direction of the Bank throughits manager or other functionaries. The Treasurers have to take their orders from day to day as regards the cashbalance or other cognate matters relating to the safe custody of cash, valuable documents, etc. belonging to theBank or its constituents. The Treasurers receive in respect of each oﬃce under the incharge a certain name sumout of which they have to pay the salary of a stated number of their assistants who may be head cashiers orcashiers or assistant cashiers and other such functionaries. They are entitled to receive bonus on the net amountsecured to them as their remuneration, being the lump sum ﬁxed in respect of each oﬃce, minus the salary of theassistants. It is true that these Treasurers are not and cannot be expected to be personally present to dischargetheir onerous duties at each one of the large number of oﬃces spread over the Punjab and outside. Naturally theyhad to be authorized to engage head cashiers, or assistant cashiers in respect of each of the oﬃces placed in theircharge. They had to guarantee the ﬁdelity of the persons so employed as their assistants. Those assistants had tobe persons in whose reliability, 'honesty and eﬃciency both the Bank and the Treasurers had conﬁdence. TheTreasurers have the right to nominate those assistants but the Bank had the ﬁnal words in the choice. The BankManager has -complete control over such nominees in the matter of leave of absence, discipline and conduct inthe discharge of their duties as assistants managing the cash and other valuables in the custody of the Bank. Fromthe very nature of things it bad to be a dual control in the sense that the Treasurers had to nominate the assistantswho are to discharge those responsible functions in connection with cash and other valuables of the Bank and theBank could not abdicate its powers of full control over the day to day working of 1438 the Cash Department. Thenominees of the Treasurers are treated on the same footing as the other servants of the Bank in the matter ofbonus' travelling allowance and provident fund, etc. It is true those nominees are to be paid by the, Treasurers butit is out of the money provided by the Bank.It is not always easy to determine whether the relation between two parties, in the present case of the Treasurersvis-a-vis the Bank, is that of servants to a master or of independent contractors who have undertaken to do aparticular job for their employer. The question has generally arisen in connection with the determination ofvicarious liability of an employer in respect of acts done by his agent (using a neutral word which includes anindependent contractor as also a servant). The distinction between a servant and an independent contractor hasbeen the subject matter of a large volume of case-law from which the text-book writers on torts have attemptedto lay down some general tests. For example, in Pollock's Law of Torts,* the distinction has thus been brought out:""A master is one who not only prescribes to the workman the end of his work, but directs or at any moment maydirect the means also, or, as it has been put, 'retains the power of controlling the work', a servant is a personsubject to the command of his master as to the manner in which he shall do his work........ An independentcontractor is one who undertakes to produce a given result but so that in the actual execution of the work he is notunder the order or ,control of the person for whom be does it, and may use his own discretion in things notspeciﬁed before- hand......................."" Clerk & Lindsell on Torts (11th Edn.) at p. 135 have adopted the descriptionof an independent contractor given by Pollock as quoted above.In the 11th Edn. of Salmond's Treatise on the Law of Torts, the same distinction has been clearly indicated in thefollowing passage at p. 98 *Pages 62 & 63 of Pollock on Torts, 15th Edn.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/1/95959542rcwww.liiofindia.orasee955.html58 9/12/ 2020SHIVNANDAN SHARMA V. THE PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK LTD. [15] INSC 15; AIR 15 SC 40 4; 15 (1) SCR 17 (15 Ma…1439 ""what then, is the test of this distinction between a servant and an independent contractor? The test is theexistence of a right of control over the agent in respect of the manner in which his work is to be done. A servant isan agent who works under the supervision and direction of his employer; an in- dependent contractor is one who ishis own master. A servant is a person engaged to obey his em- ployer's orders from time to time; an independentcontractor is a person engaged to do certain work, but to exercise his own discretion as to the mode and time ofdoing it-he is bound by his contract, but not by his employer's orders"".Those learned authors have discussed in great detail cases illustrative of those distinctions, indicating thecircumstances in which the general rule has been applied to individual cases with such modiﬁcations as the factsand circumstances of a particular case required. We are here not concerned with those nice distinctions which havebeen drawn in connection with the rule of vicarious liability in torts. We are here concerned only with the questionhow far the test laid down by the standard authors as quoted above can be applied to determine the presentcontroversy whether the Treasurers of the Bank were its servants as contended on behalf of the appellant orindependent contractors as claimed on behalf of the respondent-Bank. The agreement between the parties, assummarised above, is a composite transaction constituting the Treasurers agents of the Bank, the former agreeingto indemnify the latter against any loss occasioned to the Bank due to the lack of ﬁdelity and eﬃciency of theministerial staﬀ entrusted with the charge of the Bank's cash and valuable documents. The Treasurers have beencharged with the duty of nominating their assistants who are to be responsible in their day to day work to theBank which all the time has full control over them in the matter of their leave of absence, as to how they shall keepthe cash and other valuables and as to how they shall be under the general direction of the Bank's manager or,some 184 1440 other functionary who may be nominated by the Bank to supervise the work of the CashDepartment. The Bank makes itself answerable to the employees thus appointed by the Treasurers with theconcurrence of the Bank for their bonus, provident fund and travelling allowance. For those purposes theseassistants are to be on the same footing as the other employees of the Bank.It was contended on behalf of the respondent Bank that its agreement with the Treasurers shows that the latterbad the fullest responsibility for the appointment and dismissal and payment of salary of the employees in chargeof the, Cash Department of the Bank and that therefore the Treasurers could not but be independent contractors.It has already been noticed that the appointment of such assistants as are entrusted with the work of the CashDepartment is not under the absolute power of the Treasurers. The appointment-has to be approved by the Bankand the Treasurers cannot continue to employ those workmen in whose ﬁdelity and eﬃciency the Bank has noconﬁdence. Hence both in the matter of appointment and dismissal of the employees the Bank reserves to itselfthe power to' give direction to the Treasurers. Similarly in the matter of the payment of salary the money comesout of the coﬀers of the Bank, though it may be paid by the hand of the Treasurers. In this connection it wascontended on behalf of the appellant that payment of salary of the employees in the Cash Department is madethrough the Ban].,, itself but we have no tangible evidence in this case beyond the bare assertion at the Bar. But, inour opinion, the situation in respect of the appointment, dismissal and payment of salary of the employees of theCash Department is analogous to that of the employees of a particular department of Government, in whichappointment and dismissal of ministerial staﬀ may rest with an authority so empowered by the head of thedepartment.Payment of salary may also be made by the appointing authority but the money comes out of the Governmenttreasury. In those circumstances, can it be rightly asserted that 1441 those employees are not the servants ofGovernment? The analogy may not be perfect, because, in the present case, the appointment and dismissal of theemployees of the Cash Department is the joint responsibility of the Bank and its Treasurers. It has got to be sobecause the Treasurers are the guarantors of the ﬁdelity and eﬃciency of the employees and the Bank has toexercise complete control over the day to day discharge of their functions because it is the Bank which is vitallyand immediately concerned with the eﬃcient and honest discharge of the duties of the assistants in the CashDepartment, the eﬃcient running of which is the most important of a bank's functions.It will further be noticed with reference to the terms of the agreement set out above that whereas the Treasurersand their nominees have to take their orders from the Bank Manager or other such functionary, there is no speciﬁcprovision that those nominees shall discharge their day to day functions under the direct control of the Treasurersor that they will be subject to the immediate control of the Treasurers in the discharge of their daily duties and inthe matter of the grant of leave of absence. There could not be such a provision, as a dual control of that kind inthe daily work of the employees would lead to a great deal of confusion and lack of discipline amongst theministerial staﬀ. The employees of the Cash Department have of necessity to be under the direct control of theBank Manager or of some other functionary appointed by the Bank. It is the Bank which has undertaken theg/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/1/95959542rcwww.liiofindia.orasee955.html68 9/12/ 2020SHIVNANDAN SHARMA V. THE PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK LTD. [15] INSC 15; AIR 15 SC 40 4; 15 (1) SCR 17 (15 Ma…responsibility in the matter of their pay and prospects in the service and naturally therefore, such employees, evenas other employees of the Bank, have to take their orders from the Bank. It must therefore be held that theTreasurers are the servants of the Bank and that their nominees must equally be so.The Appellate Tribunal held that on a reading-as a whole of the clauses of the agreement aforesaid the appellantwas an employee of the Treasurers and not of the Bank, It did not address itself pointedly 1442 to the question asto what was the exact relation between the Bank and the Treasurers. It did not also consider the question as towhat would be the position of the employees of the Cash Department vis-a-Vis the Bank if it were held that theTreasurers Id. themselves were the servants of the Bank and not independent contractors. Before the AppellateTribunal both parties appear to have concentrated their attention on the question as to whether the employees ofthe Cash Department were servants of the Bank or of the Treasurers. In our opinion, that was not a correctapproach to the determination of the controversy between the parties.If the Treasurers' relation to the Bank was that of servants to a master, simply because the servants wereauthorized to appoint and dismiss the ministerial staﬀ of the Cash Department would not make the employees inthe Cash Department independent of the Bank. In that situation the ultimate employer would be the Bank throughthe agency of the Treasurers. It was argued on behalf of the respondent that even if it were held that theTreasurers were the servants of the Bank and not independent contractors, the legal position of the employees ofthe Cash Department vis-a-vis the Bank would be the same, namely, that they will be in law the servants of theTreasurers. In our opinion, there is no substance in that contention. If a master employs a servant and authorizeshim to employ a number of persons to do a particular job and to guarantee their ﬁdelity and eﬃciency for a cashconsideration., the employees thus appointed by the servant would be equally with the employer, servants of themaster. It is not always correct to say that persons appointed and liable to be dismissed by an independentcontractor can in. no circumstances be the employees of the third party. This would be clear from the followingobservations of Lord Esher, M.R., in the case of Donovan v. Laing, Wharton & Down Construction,Syndicate(1):- ""Itis true that the' defendants selected the man and paid his wages, and these are circumstances which, if nothingelse intervened, would be strong to show (1) (1893] 1 Q.B.D. 629 at 632, 1443 that he was the servant of thedefendants. So, indeed, he was as to a great many things- but as to the working of the crane he was no longertheir servant, but bound to work under the orders of Jones & Co., and, if they saw the man misconducting himselfin working the crane or disobeying their orders, they would have a right to discharge him from that employment"".Those observations have been approved in the latest decision of the House of Lords in the case of Mersey Docks &Harbour Board v. Coggins & Griﬃth (Liverpool) Ltd.(1). The House of Lords distinguished that ruling on facts butdid not depart from the general rule laid down in the earlier decision that the determinative factor is as to whichparty had control over the workers as to how they would do their job from day to day. Lord Macmillan in his speechat p. 14 has observed as follows:- ""Many reported cases were cited to your Lordships- but where,, as all agree, thequestion in each case turns on its own circumstances, decisions in other cases are rather illustrative thandeterminative. So far as attempts have been made to formulate a criterion of general application, it cannot be saidthat these attempts have been very successful"".It would thus appear that the question as to whose employee a particular person was has to be determined withreference to the facts and circumstances of each individual case.Lord Porter in the course of his speech in the reported case (supra) at p. 17 has observed as follows:- ""Many factorshave a bearing on the result. Who is paymaster, who can dismiss, how long the alternative service lasts, whatmachinery is employed, have all to be kept in mind. The expressions used in any individual case must always beconsidered in regard to the subject matter under discussion but amongst the many tests suggested I think that themost satisfactory, by which to ascertain who is the employer at any particular time is to ask who is entitled to tellthe employee the way in which he is to do the work upon which he is engaged"".(1) [ 1946] UKHL 1; [ 1947] A.C. 1, 1444 As indicated above, in the present case the direction and control of theappellant and of the ministerial staﬀ in charge of the Cash Department of the Bank was entirely vested in the Bankthrough its manager or other superior oﬃcer. We have therefore no hesitation in diﬀering from the conclusionarrived at by the Appellate Tribunal and in holding that the appellant was an employee of the Bank.That being so, the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to make the directions it did in respect of the appellant. Therespondent did not at any stage of the proceedings challenge the orders of the Tribunal on its merits. Thatconclusion being reached, there is no diﬃculty in upholding the orders of the Tribunal in respect of the appellant.

In the exercise of theirjurisdiction under Article 226, the High Courts should not act as Courts of Appeal or revision to correct mere errorsof law which do not occasion injustice in a broad and general sense. It is a sound exercise of discretion to bear inmind the policy of the legislature to have disputes about special rights, as in election cases, decided as speedily asmay be. The High Courts should not therefore entertain petitions for prerogative writs lightly in this class of case.The appellant ﬁled an election petition under section 100 of the Representation of the People -Act.

The appellant did not appear on the ﬁrst three hearings at that place so the tribunal proceeded ex parte.His counsel appeared on the fourth hearing but was not allowed to take any further part in the proceedingsbecause no good cause was shown for the earlier non-appearance and so the tribunal refused to set aside its ""exparte order"".Held, (1) Under section 90(2) of the Representation of the People Act the procedure for the trial of electionpetitions is to be, as near as may be, the same as in the trial of suits under the Civil Procedure Code;(2) under the Civil Procedure Code there is no such thing as an ex parte order for non-appearance"" which precludesfurther appearance at an adjourned hearing until the Order is set aside. If a party appears at an adjourned hearingthe court has a discretion (which must be exercised judicially) either to allow him to appear oil such terms as itthinks ﬁt, or to disallow further appearance; but (3) if he is allowed to appear then, unless good cause is shownunder Order 9, rule 7 for the earlier non-appearance the proceedings must continue from the stage at which thelater appearance is entered and the party so appearing cannot be relegated to the position he would haveoccupied if he had appeared at the earlier hearing or hearings; also, (4) in exercising its discretion the court mustsee that justice is done to all concerned, including the witnesses Rule 6 (1) (a) of Order 9 of the Civil ProcedureCode is conﬁned to the ﬁrst hearing of the suit and does not apply, per se to subsequent hearings. 0. 9, r. 7 gives aparty a right to be relegated to the position he would have occupied if he had appeared at the earlier hearing orhearings if he shows good cause. It does not per se prevent further appearance when no good cause is shown. O.17, r. 2 applies at the adjourned hearing and there, the Court is given a wide discretion to make such order as itthinks ﬁt.3 A code of procedure is a body of law designed to facilitate justice and further its ends, and should not be treatedas an enactment providing for punishments and penalties. The laws of procedure are grounded on the principle ofnatural justice which requires that men should not be condemned unheard, that decisions should not be reachedbehind their backs, that proceedings that aﬀect their lives and property should not continue in their absence andthat they should not be precluded from participating in them. Subject to clearly deﬁned exceptions the laws ofprocedure should be construed wherever reasonably possible, in the light of that principle. The court is investedwith the widest possible discretion to see that justice is done to all concerned. No hard and fast rule can be laiddown; and the court in the exercise of its judicial discretion will have, in a given case, to determine whatconsequences are to follow from non- appearance. An order awarding costs, or an adjournment, or theconsideration of the written statement and the framing of the issues on the spot, can in some cases meet the endsof justice. In other cases, more drastic action may be called for.By ""ends of justice"" is meant not only justice to the parties but also to witnesses and others who may beinconvenienced. The convenience of the witnesses, which deserves the greatest consideration, is ordinarily lostsight of in this class of case. Justice strongly. demands that this unfortunate section of the general public com-pelled to discharge public duties, usually at loss and inconvenience to themselves should not be ignored in theover-all picture of what will best serve the ends of justice; and it may well be a sound exercise of discretion in aparticular case to refuse an adjournment and permit the plaintiﬀ to examine the witnesses present and not allowthe defendant to cross-examine them. But broadly speaking, after all the various factors have been taken intoconsideration and carefully weighed, the endeavour should be to avoid snap decisions and to aﬀord the parties areal opportunity of ﬁghting out their cases fairly squarely.The Court must in every case exercise the discretion given to it. Its hands are not tied by a so-called ""ex partsorder"", and, if it thinks they are tied by rule 7 of Order 9 of the Code, then it is not exercising the discretion whichthe law says it should, and in a given case interference may be called for.Held, that the Election Tribunal did not exercise the discretion given to it by law because of a misapprehensionthat it had none. It was directed to do so now and to proceed with the further hearing of the case in accordancewith law.Hari Vishnu v. Ahmed Ishaque ([ 1955]S.C.R. 1 S.C.R. 1104), Darga Shankar Mehta v.

K. Rastogi and Ganpat Rai, for the appellant.R. C. Prasad, for S. L. Chhibber, for respondent No. 2.1955. March 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-The second respondent Bhurey Lal ﬁled anelection petition under section 100 of the Representation of the People Act against the appellant Sangram Singhand two others for setting aside Sangram Singh's election.The proceedings commenced at Kotah and after some hearings the Tribunal made an order on 11-12-1952 that thefurther sittings would be at Udaipur from the 16th to the 21st March, 1953. It was discovered later that the 16thwas a public holiday, so on 5-1-1953 the dates were changed to ""from the 17th March onwards"" and the partieswere duly notiﬁed.On the 17th the appellant did not appear nor did any of the three counsel whom he had engaged, so the Tribunalproceeded ex parte after waiting till 1-15 P.m.The Tribunal examined Bhurey Lal and two witnesses on the 17th, ﬁve more witnesses on the 18th and on the 19ththe case was adjourned till the 20th.On the 20th one of the appellant's three counsel, Mr, Bharat Raj, appeared but was not allowed to 5 take any partin the proceedings because the Tribunal said that it was proceeding ex parte at that stage. Three more witnesseswere then examined.On the following day, the 21st, the appellant made an application asking that the ex parte proceedings be set asideand asking that he be allowed to cross-examine those of Bhurey Lal's witnesses whose evidence had already beenrecorded.The Tribunal heard arguments and passed an order the same day rejecting the application on the ground that theappellant had ""failed to satisfy ourselves that there was -any just or unavoidable reason preventing the appearanceof respondent No. 1 himself or of any of his three learned advocates between the 17th and the 19th of March,1953"", and it added- ""at all events, when para 10 of the aﬃdavit makes it clear that Shri Bharatraj had alreadyreceived instructions to appear on 17-3-1953 there was nothing to justify his non- appearance on the 18th and 19thof March, 1953, if not, on the 17th as well"".The appellant thereupon ﬁled a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Rajasthanand further proceedings before the Tribunal were stayed.The High Court rejected the petition on 17-7-1953 on two grounds- (1) ""In the ﬁrst -place, the Tribunal was theauthority to decide whether the reasons were suﬃcient or otherwise and the fact that the Tribunal came to theconclusion that the reasons set forth by counsel for the petitioner were insuﬃcient cannot be challenged in apetition of this nature"" and (2) ""On the merits also, we feel no hesitation in holding that counsel for the petitionerwere grossly negligent in not appearing on the date which had been ﬁxed for hearing, more than two monthspreviously"".Five months later, on 16-12-1953, the High Court granted a certiﬁcate under article 133(1) (C) of the Constitutionfor leave to appeal to this Court, 6 The only question before the High Court was whether the Tribunal was right inrefusing to allow the appellant's counsel to appear and take part in the proceedings on and after the 20th ofMarch, 1953, and the ﬁrst question that we have to decide is whether that is suﬃcient ground to give the Highg/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/10GINGLECTIOROTUREY1955NS95295Cwww.liiofindia.oraseeNS957.html3 9/12/ 2020SANRAM SH V. EN TIBUNAL, KAH,BHY LAL BAA [] IC 17; A IR 15 SC 45; 15 (2) SR 1 ( 22 …Court jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution. That, in our opinion, is no longerres integra. The question was settled by a Bench of seven Judges of this Court in Hari Vishnu v. Ahmad Ishaque(1)in these terms:""Certiorari will also be issued when the Court or Tribunal acts illegally in the exercise of its undoubted jurisdiction,as when it decides without giving an op- portunity to the parties to be heard, or violates the principles of naturaljustice"".That is exactly the position here.It was urged that that cannot be so in election matters because of section 105 of the Representation of the PeopleAct of 1951 (Act XLIII of 1951), a section which was not considered in the earlier case. It runs thus:""Every order of the Tribunal made under this Act shall be ﬁnal and conclusive"".It was argued that neither the High Court nor the Supreme Court can itself transgress the law in trying to set rightwhat it considers is an error of law on the part of the Court or Tribunal whose records are under consideration. Itwas submitted that the legislature intended the decisions of these tribunals to be ﬁnal on all matters, whether offact or of law, accordingly, they cannot be said to commit an error of law when, acting within the ambit of theirjurisdiction, they decide and lay down what the law is, for in that sphere their decisions are absolute, as absolute asthe decisions of the Supreme Court in its own sphere.Therefore,'it was said, the only question that is left open for examination under article 226 in the case of anElection Tribunal is whether it acted within the scope of its jurisdiction.(1) [ 1954] INSC 122; [ 1955] 1 S.C.R. 1104,1121, 7 But this, also, is no longer open to question. The point has beendecided by three Constitution Benches of this Court. In Hari Vishnu v. Ahmad Ishaque(1) the eﬀect of section 105 ofthe Representation of the People Act was not considered, but the Court laid down in general terms that thejurisdiction under article 226 having been conferred by the Constitution, limitations cannot be placed on it exceptby the Constitution itself: see pages 238 and 242. Section 105 was, however, considered in Durga Shankar Mehta v.Raghuraj Singh(1) and it was held that that section cannot cut down or aﬀect the overriding powers of this Courtunder article 136. The same rule was applied to article 226 in Rai Krushna Bose v. Binod Kanungo and others(1) andit was decided that section 105 cannot take away or whittle down the powers of the High Court under article 226.Following those decisions we hold that the jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 is not taken away orcurtailed by section 105.The jurisdiction which articles 226 and 136 confer entitles the High Courts and this Court to examine the decisionsof all Tribunals to see whether they have acted illegally.That jurisdiction cannot be taken away by a legislative device that purports to confer power on a tribunal to actillegally by enacting a statute that its illegal acts shall become legal the moment the tribunal chooses to say theyare legal. The legality of an act or conclusion is something that exists outside and apart. from the decision of an in-ferior tribunal. It is a part of the law of the land which cannot be ﬁnally deter-mined or altered by any tribunal oflimited jurisdiction. The High Courts and the Supreme Court alone can determine what the law of the land is vis-a-vis all other courts and tribunals and they alone can pronounce with authority and ﬁnality on what is legal andwhat is not. All that an inferior tribunal can do is to reach a tentative conclusion which is subject to review underarticles 226 and 136. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the High (1) [ 1954] INSC 122; [ 1955] 1 S.C.R. 1104, 1121. (2)[ 1955] 1 S.C.R. 267.(3) [ 1954] INSC 8; 1954 S.C.R. 913, 918.8 Courts under article 226 with that of the Supreme Court above them remains to its fullest extent despite section105.That, however, is not to say that the jurisdiction will be exercised whenever there is an error of law. The HighCourts do not, and should not, act as Courts of appeal under article 226. Their powers are purely discretionary andthough no limits can be placed upon that discretion it must be exercised along recognised lines and not arbitrarily;and one of the limitations imposed by the Courts on, themselves is that they will not exercise jurisdiction in thisclass of case unless substantial injustice has ensued, or is likely to ensue. They will not allow themselves to beg/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/10GINGLECTIOROTUREY1955NS95295Cwww.liiofindia.oraseeNS957.html4 9/12/ 2020SANRAM SH V. EN TIBUNAL, KAH,BHY LAL BAA [] IC 17; A IR 15 SC 45; 15 (2) SR 1 ( 22 …turned into Courts of appeal or revision to set right mere errors of law which do not occasion injustice in a broadand general sense, for, though no legislature can impose limitations on these constitutional powers it is a soundexercise of discretion to bear in mind the policy of the legislature to have disputes about these special rightsdecided as speedily as may be. Therefore, writ petitions should not be lightly entertained in this class of case.We now turn to the decision of the Tribunal. The procedure of these tribunals is governed by section 90 of the Act.The portion of the section that is relevant here is sub- section (2) which is in these terms:""Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any rules made thereunder, every election petition shall be tried by theTribunal, as nearly as may be, in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908(Act V of 1908) to the trial of suits"".We must therefore direct our attention to that portion of the Civil Procedure Code that deals with the trial of suits.Now a code of procedure must be regarded as such. It is procedure, something designed to facilitate justice andfurther its ends: not a penal enactment for punishment and penalties; not a thing designed to trip people up. Tootechnical a construction of sections that leaves no room for reasonable elasticity of inter- 9 pretation shouldtherefore be guarded against (provided always that justice is done to both sides) lest the very means designed forthe furtherance of justice be used to frustrate it.Next, there must be ever present to the mind the fact that our laws of procedure are grounded on a principle ofnatural justice which requires that men should not be condemned unheard, that decisions should not be reachedbehind their backs, that proceedings that aﬀect their lives and property should not continue in their absence andthat they should not be precluded from participating in them. Of course, there must be exceptions and where theyare clearly deﬁned they must be given eﬀect to. But taken by and large, and subject to that proviso, our laws ofprocedure should be construed, wherever that is reasonably possible, in the light of that principle.The existence of such a principle has been doubted, and in any event was condemned as unworkable andimpractical by O'Sullivan, J. in Hariram v. Pribhdas(1). He regarded it as an indeterminate term ""liable to causemisconception"" and his views were shared by Wanchoo, C. J. and Bapna, J. in Rajasthan: Sewa Ram v. Misrimal(1).But that a law of natural justice exists in the sense that a party must be heard in a Court of law, or at any rate beaﬀorded an opportunity to appear and defend himself, unless there is express provision to the contrary, is, wethink, beyond dispute. See the observations of the Privy Council in Balakrighna Udayar v. Vasudeva Ayyar(3), andespecially in T. M. Barret v. African Products Ltd.(1) where Lord Buckmaaster said ""Do forms or procedure shouldever be permitted to exclude the presentation of a litigant's defence"". Also Hari Vishnu's case which we have justquoted.In our opinion, Wallace, J. was right in VenkataSubbiah v.Lakshminarassimham(5) in holding that ""One cardinal principle to be observed in trials by a Court obviously is thata party has a right to (1) A.I.R 1945 Sind 98,102 (2) A.I.R. 1952 Raj. 12,14.(3) A.I.R. 40 Mad. 793, 800 (4) A.I.R. 1928 P.C. 261, 262.(5) A.I.R. 1925 Mad. 1274.2 10 appear and plead his cause on all occasions when that cause comes on for hearing"", and that ""It follows that aparty should not be deprived of that right and in fact the Court has no option to refuse that right, unless the Codeof Civil Procedure deprives him of it"".Let us now examine that Code; and ﬁrst, we will turn to the body of the Code. Section 27 provides that ""Where asuit has been duly instituted, a summons may be issued to the defendant to appear and answer the claim"".Section 30 gives the Court power to ""(b) issue summonses to persons whose attendance is required either to giveevidence or to produce documents or such other objects as aforesaid"".Then come the penalties for default. They are set out in section 32 but they are conﬁned to cases in which asummons has been issued under section 30. There is no penalty for a refusal or an omission to appear in responseto a summons under section 27. It is true certain consequences will follow if a defendant does not appear and,popularly speaking, those consequences may be regarded as the penalty for nonappearance, but they are notg/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/10GINGLECTIOROTUREY1955NS95295Cwww.liiofindia.oraseeNS957.html5 9/12/ 2020SANRAM SH V. EN TIBUNAL, KAH,BHY LAL BAA [] IC 17; A IR 15 SC 45; 15 (2) SR 1 ( 22 …penalties in the true sense of the term. They are not punishments which the Court is authorised to administer fordisregard of its orders.The antithesis that section 32 draws between section 27 and section 30 is that an omission to appear in response toa summons under section 27 carries no penalty in the strict sense, while disregard of a summons under section 30may entail punishment. The spirit of this distinction must be carried over to the First Schedule. We deprecate thetendency of some Judges to think in terms of punishment and penalties properly so called when they shouldinstead be thinking of compensation and the avoidance of injustice to both sides.We turn next to the Rules in the First Schedule. It is relevant to note that the Rules draw a distinction between theﬁrst hearing and subsequent hearings, 11 and that the ﬁrst hearing can be either (a) for settlement of issues only.,or (b) for ﬁnal disposal of the suit.First, there is Order V. rule 1:""................................ a summons may be issued to the defendant to appear and answer the claim on a. day to betherein speciﬁed"".This summons must state whether the hearing is to be for settlement of issues only or for ﬁnal hearing (rule 5). If itis for ﬁnal hearing, then (rule 8):""it shall also direct the defendant to produce, on the day ﬁxed for his appearance, all witnesses upon whoseevidence he intends to rely in support of his case"".Then comes Order VIII, rule 1 which expressly speaks of ""the ﬁrst hearing"". Order IX follows and is headed""Appearance of parties and consequence of non-appearance"".Now the word ""consequence"" as opposed to the word ""penalty"" used in section 32 is signiﬁcant. It emphasises theantithesis to which we have already drawn attention. So also in rule 12 the marginal note is ""Consequence of non-attendance"" and the body of the rule states that the party who does not appear and cannot show suﬃcient cause""shall be subject to all the provisions of the foregoing rules applicable to plaintiﬀs and defendants, respectively,who do not appear"".The use of the word ""penalty"" is scrupulously avoided.Our attention was drawn to rule 6(2) and it was argued that Order IX does contemplate the imposition of penalties.But we do not read this portion of the rule in that light. All that the plaintiﬀ has to do here is to pay the costsoccasioned by the postponement which in practice usually means the cost of a fresh summons and the diet moneyand so forth for such of the witnesses as are present; and these costs the plaintiﬀ must pay irrespective of theresult.Rule I of Order IX starts by saying- ""On the day ﬁxed in the summons for the defendant to appear andanswer................................................."" 12 and the rest of the rules in that Order are consequential on that. This isemphasised by the use of the word ""postponement"" in rule 6 (1)(c), of ""adjournment"" in rule 7 and of""adjournment"" in rule 1. Therefore, we reach the position that Order IX, rule 6 (1) (a), which is the rule relied on, isconﬁned to the ﬁrst hearing of the suit and does not per se apply to subsequent hearings: see SahibzadaZeinulabdin Khan v. Sahibzada Ahmed Raza Khan(1).Now to analyse rule 6 and examine its bearing on the ﬁrst hearing. When the plaintiﬀ appears and the defendantdoes not appear when the suit is called on for hearing, if it is proved that the summons was duly served- ""(a).................................................... the Court may proceed ex parte"".The whole question is, what do these words mean? Judicial opinion is sharply divided about this. On the one side isthe view propounded by Wallace, J. in Venkatasubbiah v.Lakshminarasimham(2) that ex parte merely means in the absence of the other party, and on the other side is theview of O'Sullivan, J., in Hariram v. Pribhdas(3) that it means that the Court is at liberty to proceed without thedefendant till the termination of the proceedings unless the defendant shows good cause for his non-appearance.The re- maining decisions, and there are many of them, take one or the other of those two views.g/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/10GINGLECTIOROTUREY1955NS95295Cwww.liiofindia.oraseeNS957.html6 9/12/ 2020SANRAM SH V. EN TIBUNAL, KAH,BHY LAL BAA [] IC 17; A IR 15 SC 45; 15 (2) SR 1 ( 22 …In our opinion, Wallace, J. and the other Judges who adopt the same line of thought, are right. As we have alreadyobserved, our laws of procedure are based on the principle that, as far as possible, no proceeding in a Court of lawshould be conducted to the detriment of a person in his absence. There are of course exceptions, and this is one ofthem. When the defendant has been served and has been aﬀorded an opportunity of appearing, then, if he doesnot appear, the Court may proceed in his absence. But, be it noted, the Court is not directed to make an ex (1) 5I.A. 233, 236.(2) A,I.R. 1925 Mad. 1274.(3) A.I.R. 1945 Sind 98, 102.13 parte order. Of course the fact that it is proceeding ex parte will be recorded in the minutes of its proceedingsbut that is merely a statement of the fact and is not an order made against the defendant in the sense of an exparte decree or other ex parte order which the Court is authorised to make. All that rule 6 (1) (a) does is to removea bar and no more. It merely authorises the Court to do that which it could not have done without this authority,namely to proceed in the absence of one of the parties. The contrast in language between rules 7 and 13emphasises this.Now, as we have seen, the ﬁrst hearing is either for the settlement of issues or for ﬁnal hearing. If it is only for thesettlement of issues, then the Court cannot pass an ex parte decree on that date because of the proviso to OrderXV, rule 3(1) which provides that that can only. be done when ""the parties or their pleaders are present and none ofthem objects"".On the other hand, if it is for ﬁnal hearing, an ex parte decree can be passed, and if it is passed, then Order IX, rule13 comes into play and before the decree is set aside the Court is required to make an order to set it aside.Contrast this with rule 7 which does not require the setting aside of what is commonly, though erroneously, knownas ""the ex parte order"". No order is contemplated by the Code and therefore no order to set aside the order iscontemplated either. But a decree is a command or order of the Court and so can only be set aside by anotherorder made and recorded with due formality.Then comes rule 7 which provides that if at an adjourned hearing the defendant appears and shows good cause forhis ""previous non-appearance"", he can be heard in answer to the suit ""as if he had appeared on the day ﬁxed for hisappearance"".This cannot be read to mean, as it has been by some learned Judges, that he cannot be allowed to appear at all ifhe does not show good cause. All it means is that he cannot be relegated to the position he would have occupied ifhe had appeared, 14 We turn next to the adjourned hearing. That is dealt with in Order XVII. Rule I (1) empowersthe Court to adjourn the hearing and whenever it does so it must ﬁx a day ""for the further hearing of the suit"",except that once the hearing of the evidence has begun it must go on from day to day till all the witnesses inattendance have been examined unless the Court considers, for reasons to be recorded in writing, that a furtheradjournment is necessary. Then follows rule 2- ""Where., on any day to which the hearing of the suit is adjourned,the parties or any of them fail to appear, the Court may proceed to dispose of the suit in one of the modes directedin that behalf by Order IX or make such other order as it thinks- ﬁt"".Now rule 2 only applies when one or both of the parties do not appear on the day ﬁxed far the adjourned hearing.In that event, the Court is thrown back to Order IX with the additional power to make ""such order as it thinks ﬁt"".When it goes back to Order IX it ﬁnds that it is again empowered to proceed ex parte on the adjourned hearing inthe same way as it did, or could have done, if one or other of the parties had not appeared at the ﬁrst hearing, thatis to say, the right to proceed ex parte is a right which accrues from day to day because at each adjourned hearingthe Court is thrown back to Order IX, rule 6. It is not a mortgaging of the future but only applies to the particularhearing at which a party was aﬀorded the chance to appear and did not avail himself of it. Therefore, if a partydoes appear on ""the day to which the hearing of the suit is adjourned"", he cannot be stopped from participating inthe proceedings simply because he did not appear on the ﬁrst or some other hearing.But though he has the right to appear at an adjourned hearing, he has no right to set back the hands of the clock.Order IX, rule 7 makes that clear. Therefore, unless he can show good cause, he must accept all that has gonebefore and be content to proceed from the stage at which he comes in.g/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/10GINGLECTIOROTUREY1955NS95295Cwww.liiofindia.oraseeNS957.html7 9/12/ 2020SANRAM SH V. EN TIBUNAL, KAH,BHY LAL BAA [] IC 17; A IR 15 SC 45; 15 (2) SR 1 ( 22 …But what exactly does that import? To determine that it will be neces- 15 sary to hark back to the ﬁrst hearing.We have already seen that when a summons is issued to the defendant it must state whether the hearing is for thesettlement of issues only or for the ﬁnal disposal of the suit (Order V, rule 5). In either event, Order VIII, rule Icomes into play and if the defendant does not present a written statement of his defence, the Court can insist thathe shall; and if, on being required to do so, he fails to comply- ""the Court may pronounce judgment against him, ormake such order in relation to the suit as it thinks ﬁt"". (Order VIII, rule 10).This invests the Court with the widest possible discretion and enables it to see that justice is done to both sides;and also to witnesses if they are present: a matter on which we shall dwell later.We have seen that if the defendant does not appearat the ﬁrst hearing, the Court can proceed exparte, whichmeans that it can proceed without a written statement; and Order IX, rule 7 makes it clear that unless good causeis shown the defendant cannot be relegated to the position that he would have occupied if he had appeared. Thatmeans that he cannot put in a written statement unless he is allowed to do so, and if the case is one in which theCourt considers a written statement should have been put in, the consequences entailed by Order VIII, rule 10must be suﬀered. What those consequences should be in a given case is for the Court, in the exercise of its judicialdiscretion, to determine. No hard and fast rule can be laid down. ID some cases an order awarding costs to theplaintiﬀ would meet the ends of justice: an adjournment can be granted or a written statement can be consideredoil the spot and issues framed. In other cases, the ends of justice may call for more drastic action.Now when we speak of the ends of justice, we mean justice not only to the defendant and to the other side butalso to witnesses and others who may be inconvenienced. It is an unfortunate fact that the convenience of thewitness is ordinarily lost sight of in this class of case and yet be is the one that deserves 16 the greatestconsideration. As a rule, he is not parti- cularly interested in the dispute but he is vitally interested in his own aﬀairswhich he is compelled to abandon because a Court orders him to come to the assistance of one or other of theparties to a dispute. His own business has to suﬀer. He may have to leave his family and his aﬀairs for days on end.He is usually out of pocket.Often he is a poor man living in an out of the way village and may have to trudge many weary miles on foot. Andwhen he gets there, there are no arrangements for him. He is not given accommodation; and when he reaches theCourt, in most places there is no room in which he can wait. He has to loiter about in the verandahs or under -thetrees, shivering in the cold of winter and exposed to the heat of summer , wet and miserable in the rains: and then,after wasting hours and sometimes days for his turn, he is brusquely told that he must go back and come againanother day. Justice strongly demands that this unfortunate section of the general public compelled to dischargepublic duties, usually at loss and inconvenience to themselves, should not be ignored in the over all picture of whatwill best serve the ends of justice and it may well be a sound exercise of discretion in a given case to refuse anadjournment and permit the plaintiﬀ to examine the witnesses present and not allow the defendant to cross-examine them, still less to adduce his own evidence. It all depends on the particular case. But broadly speaking,after all the various factors have been taken into consideration and carefully weighed, the endeavour should be toavoid snap decisions and to aﬀord litigants a real opportunity of ﬁghting out their cases fairly and squarely. Costswill be adequate compen- sation in many cases and in others the Court has almost unlimited discretion about theterms it can impose provided always the discretion is judicially exercised and is not arbitrary.In the Code of 1859 there was a provision (section 119) which said that- ""No appeal shall lie from a judgmentpassed exparte against a defendant who has not appeared"".17 The Privy Council held in Sahibzada Zeinulabdin Khan v. Sahibzada Ahmed Raza Khan(' ) that this only appliedto a defendant who had not appeared at all at any stage, therefore, if once an appearance was entered, the rightof appeal was not taken away. One. of the grounds of their decision was that- ""The general rule is that an appeallies to the High Court from a decision of a civil or subordinate Judge, and a defendant ought not to be deprived ofthe right of appeal, except by express words or necessary implication"".The general rule, founded on principles of natural justice, that proceedings in a Court of justice should not beconducted behind the back of a party in the absence of an express provision to that eﬀect is no less compelling.But that apart. It would be anomalous to hold that the eﬃcacy of the so-called ex parte order expends itself in theﬁrst Court and that thereafter a defendant can be allowed to appear in the appellate Court and can be beard andcan be permitted to urge in that Court the very matters he is shut out from urging in the trial Court; and in theg/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/10GINGLECTIOROTUREY1955NS95295Cwww.liiofindia.oraseeNS957.html8 9/12/ 2020SANRAM SH V. EN TIBUNAL, KAH,BHY LAL BAA [] IC 17; A IR 15 SC 45; 15 (2) SR 1 ( 22 …event that the appellate Court considers a remand necessary he can be permitted to do the very things he wasprecluded from doing in the ﬁrst instance without wetting the exparte order set aside under Order IX, rule 7.Now this is not a case in which the defendant with whom we are concerned did not appear at the ﬁrst hearing. Hedid.The ﬁrst hearing was on 11-12-1952 at Kotah. The appellant (the ﬁrst defendant) appeared through counsel andﬁled a written statement. Issues were framed and the case was adjourned till the 16th March at Udaipur for thepetitioners evidence alone from the 16th to the 21st March. Therefore, Order IX, rules 6 and 7 do not apply interms. But we have been obliged to examine this order at length because of the diﬀering views taken in the variousHigh Courts and because the contention is that Order XVII, rule 2 throws one back to the position under Order IX,rules 6 and 7, and there, according to one set of (1) 5 I.A. 233.3 18 views, the position is that once an ex parte ""order"" is ""Passed"" against a defendant he cannot take further partin the proceedings unless he gets that 'corder"" set aside by showing good cause under rule 7. But that is by nomeans the case.If the defendant does not appear at the adjourned hearing (irrespective of whether or not he appeared at the ﬁrsthearing) Order XVII, rule 2 applies and the Court is given the widest possible discretion either ""to dispose of thesuit in one of the modes directed in that behalf by Order IX or make such other order as it thinks ﬁt"".The point is this. The Court has a discretion which it must exercise. Its hands are not tied by the so called ex parteorder; and if it thinks they are tied by Order IX, rule 7 then it is not exercising the discretion which the law says itshould and, in a given case, interference may be called for.The learned Judges who constituted a Full Bench of the Lucknow Chief Court (Tulsha Devi v. Sri Krishna(1) )thought that if the original ex parte order did not enure throughout all future hearings it would be necessary tomake a fresh ex parte order at each succeeding hearing. But this proceeds on the mistaken assumption that an exparte order is required. The order sheet, or minutes of the proceedings, has to show which of the parties werepresent and if a party is absent the Court records that fact and then records whether it will proceed ex parteagainst him, that is to say, proceed in his absence, or whether it will adjourn the hearing; and it must necessarilyrecord this fact at every subsequent bearing because it has to record the presence and absence of the parties ateach hearing. With all due deference to the learned Judges who hold this view, we do not think this is a grave or asound objection.A much weightier consideration is that the plaintiﬀ may be gravely prejudiced in a given case because, as ,thelearned Rajasthan Judges point out, and as O'Sullivan, J. thought, when a case proceeds ex parte, (1) A.I.R. 1949Oudh 59.19 the plaintiﬀ does not adduce as much evidence as he would have if it had been contested. He contents himselfwith leading just enough to establish a prima facie case.Therefore, if he is suddenly confronted with a contest after he has closed his case and the defendant then comesforward with an army of witnesses he would be taken by surprise and gravely prejudiced. That objection is,however, easily met by the wide discretion that is vested in the Court. If it has reason to believe that the defendanthas by his conduct misled the plaintiﬀ into doing what these learned Judges apprehend, then it might be a soundexercise of discretion to shut out cross-examination and the abduction of evidence on the defendant's part and toallow him only to argue at the stage when arguments are heard. On the other hand, cases may occur when theplaintiﬀ is not and ought not to be, misled. If these considerations are to weigh, then surely the sounder rule is toleave the Court with an unfettered discretion so that it can take every circumstance into consideration and dowhat seems best suited to meet the ends of justice in the case before it.In the present case, we are satisﬁed that the Tribunal did not exercise its discretion because it considered that ithad none and thought that until the ex parte order was set aside the defendant could not appear either personallyor through counsel. We agree with the Tribunal, and with the High Court, that no good cause was shown and sothe defendant had no right to be relegated to the position that he would have occupied if he had appeared on 17-3-1953, but that he had a right to appear through counsel on 20-3-1953 and take part in the proceedings -from thestage at which they had then reached, subject to such terms and conditions as the Tribunal might think ﬁt toimpose, is we think, undoubted. Whether he should have been allowed to cross- examine the three witnesses whowere examined after the appearance of his counsel, or whether he should have been allowed to adduce evidence,g/in/cs/cn/IC/15/1/10GINGLECTIOROTUREY1955NS95295Cwww.liiofindia.oraseeNS957.html9 9/12/ 2020SANRAM SH V.

Therefore, to all the respondentNo. 1 to step in now would certainly handicap the petitioner and would amount to a bit of injustice which we canneither contemplate nor con done"".But this assumes that the petitioner was misled and closed his case ""after oﬀering as little evidence as he thoughtwas just necessary to get his petition disposed of ex parte"". It does not decide that that was in fact the case.If the defendant's conduct really gave rise to that impression and the plaintiﬀ would have adduced more evidencethan he did, the order would be unexceptional but until that is found to be the fact a mere assumption would notbe a sound basis for the kind of discretion which the Court must exercise in this class of case after carefullyweighing all the relevant circumstances. We, therefore, disagreeing with the High Court which has upheld theTribunal's order, quash the order of the Tribunal and direct it to exercise the discretion vested in it by law along thelines we have indicated. In doing so the Tribunal will consider whether the plaintiﬀ was in fact misled or could havebeen misled if he had acted with due diligence and caution. It will take in-to consideration the fact that thedefendant did enter an appearance and did ﬁle a written statement and that issues were framed in his presence;also that the case was ﬁxed for the ""Petitioner's"" evidence only and not for that of the appellant; and that thepetitioner examined all the witnesses he had present on the 17th and the 18th and did not give up any of them;that he was given 21 an adjournment on 19-3-1953 for the examination witnesses who did not come on that dateand that the examined three more on 20-3-1953 after the defendant had entered an appearance through counselan( claimed the right to plead;also whether, when the appellant's only protest was against the bearings a Udaipur on dates ﬁxed for thepetitioner's evidence alone, it would be legitimate for a party acting with due caution and diligence to assume thatthe other side had abandoned his right to adduce his own evidence should the hearing for that be ﬁxed at someother place or at some other date in the same place.The Tribunal will also consider and determine whether it will be proper in the circumstances of this case to allowthe appellant to adduce his own evidence.The Tribunal will now reconsider its orders of the 20th, the 21st and the 23rd of March 1953 in the light of ourobservations and will proceed accordingly.The records will be sent to the Election Commission with directions to that authority to reconstitute the Tribunal, ifnecessary, and to direct it to proceed with this matter along the lines indicated above.There will be no order about costs."

T.G.N. Ayyar, Secretary to Government"".In pursuance of that resolution the surety bond in question was taken from the respondents. The material portionof the bond (Ex. 2) is in these terms:"" We, S. T.

As a result of the constitutional changes the jurisdiction of the Privy Councilcame to be transferred to the Federal Court by virtue of the Abolition of the Privy Council Juris- 81 diction Act(Constituent Assembly Act V of 1949) which came into force on the 10th October, 1949. As, from that date (""theappointed day"" ) all appeals' pending before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council by virtue of section 6stood transferred to the Federal Court. Ali Khan' s appeal to the Privy Council thus got transferred to the FederalCourt and in due course was heard by this Court. This Court dismissed the appeal in November 1950. In themeantime Ali Khan, the convicted person, who had gone to London to look after his appeal there, migrated toPakistan and thus placed himself beyond the jurisdiction of the courts in India. In December 1950 the DeputyCommissioner of Singhbhum issued notice to the sureties, the respondents, to produce Ali Khan within three days.On their failure to do so, the Deputy Commissioner called upon the sureties to show cause why their bond shouldnot be forfeited. The sureties raised certain legal objections to the proceedings taken by the DeputyCommissioner. They contended that he had no jurisdiction to initiate the proceedings. The Deputy Commissionerpostponed the decision of the preliminary objections and directed that all the points in controversy shall be heardand determined at the ﬁnal hearing. Against that order the respondents moved the Sessions Judge of Singhbhumwho by his orders dated the 12th November, 1951 overruled their objections and held that the DeputyCommissioner had jurisdiction to initiate the proceedings.It is not necessary to set out his reasons. The respondents moved the High Court in revision against the ordersaforesaid of the Sessions Judge. A Division Bench of the High Court allowed the application holding that theDeputy Commissioner had no such jurisdiction as he purported to exercise in the matter of enforcing the terms ofthe surety bond against them. Accordingly, the High Court quashed the proceedings before the DeputyCommissioner. Hence this appeal by the State of Bihar.From the terms of the surety bond quoted above it would appear that the sureties bound themselves for 11 82payment of Rs. 50,000 "" only in case Mr. Ali Khan fails............................ to surrender to the Deputy Commissioner.la.og/in/cs/cn/IC/15/18.h/020THTTOM95NS95795Carc95wwwiiofindiraseeNS95tml23 9/12/2E SAE OF BIHAR V.

In view of this clear provision in thebond the terms of which being penal in nature must be very strictly construed, it cannot be said that thecontingencies contemplated by the parties has occurred. There was no judgment or order of the JudicialCommittee upholding either in part or in whole the sentence against Ali Khan. As the terms of the bond soconstrued cannot be said to have been fulﬁlled, the penalty stipulated has not been incurred. It must therefore beheld that the proceedings taken against the respondents were entirely misconceived. It was in thesecircumstances that we did not think it necessary to hear the appeal on its merits, that is to say, on the point ofjurisdiction on which the case had been decided by the High Court.It was contended by the Advocate-General of Bihar who appeared in support of the appeal that in the eventswhich had happened there could be no judgment or order of the Judicial Committee and that therefore thejudgment of this Court, which by virtue of the constitutional changes had come by the jurisdiction vested in thePrivy Council, should be deemed to be the judgment or order contemplated by the parties to the surety bond. Inour opinion, there is no substance in this contention, ﬁrstly, because there is no term in the bond to the eﬀect thatthe surety would be bound by any judgment or order given by such other court as may succeed to the jurisdictionthen vested in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to hear the appeal preferred by Ali Khan against hisconviction by the courts in India:and secondly, because there is no room, while construing the penal clause of a surety bond, for the application of alegal ﬁction as suggested on behalf of the appellant. The Government through their legal advisers were not 83circumspect enough to insert any such alternative clause as would have given the judgment or order of, this Courtthe same eﬀect as is contemplated by the terms of the surety bond quoted above.The appeal must therefore be dismissed in limine.Appeal dismissed."

Mehta, for the respondents Nos. 3 to 5.1955. March 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal on leavegranted by the High Court of Punjab against its judgment aﬃrming the decree of the Sikh Gurdwara Tribunaldated the 19th December, 1940, dismissing the plaintiﬀ ' s suit. The plaintiﬀ in the appeal is the Committee ofManagement of Sikh Gurdwaras within the Municipal limits of Amritsar (except the Gurdwara Sri Akal TakhatSahib, Amritsar). The plaint was ﬁled under section 25-A of the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, (Punjab Act VIII of 1925)(hereinafter referred to as the Act) for possession of certain properties situated in Amritsar, marked and boundedas speciﬁed in the plaint and purporting to have been declared as a Sikh Gurdwara by the Government of Punjabunder section 17 of the Act by means of the notiﬁcation No. 9-G dated the 3rd March, 1937.The case of the plaintiﬀ-Committee is that these properties were, and were determined to be, a Sikh Gurdwara, byname Gurdwara Bunga Sarkar, by the Sikh Gurdwara Tribunal by its decree dated the 4th November, 1935 andconﬁrmed on appeal therefrom by the High Court of Judicature at Lahore, on the 16th June, 1936 and thataccordingly the Committee was entitled to possession of the properties. The facts that have led up to the presentappeal are as follows: After the Act was passed and within one year of its commencement the then existing non-statutory Shiromani Gur- 69 dwara Parbandhak Committee ﬁled a list under section 3 of the Act claiming the suitproperties and certain other items attached thereto as belonging to the Gurdwara Harmandir Sahib. Theseproperties comprised two items called Bunga Sarkar and Bunga Mai Mallan and the shops appurtenant to each ofthem. Objections were ﬁled to this list by way of two applications under section 8 of the Act claiming these asprivate properties. One was by Sardar Balwant Singh dated the 8th March., 1928 and the other was by SardarRaghbir Singh dated the 10th March, 1928. Sardar Raghbir Singh claimed the whole of Bunga Sarkar and itsappurtenant shops as well as 1/3rd of the Bunga Mai Mallan and of the appurtenant shops. Sardar Balwant Singh' sclaim was conﬁned to 1/3rd share in Bunga Mai Mallan and in the appurtenant shops. The other 1/3rd share inBunga Mai Mallan was apparently treated by these claimants as belong- ing to some other person who was not aparty to these proceedings. These two applications were forwarded under section 14 of the Act to the GurdwaraTribunal for its decision. The parties to these -proceedings entered into a compromise on the 6th february, 1930.There were two compromises one relating to each of the applications. The net eﬀect of the compromises was thatsome out of the items claimed were admitted to be the private property of the respective claimants and the rest aswakf bungas for the Yatries to Sri Darbar Sahib, that the non-personal properties were to remain in themanagement of the claimants, their heirs and representatives as such wakf with certain stipulations as to how thatmanagement was to be carried on. The Tribunal disposed of the two applications before them in terms of thesecompromises. It may be mentioned that though the original list under section 3 of the Act was ﬁled by the thennon-statutory Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the compromises were entered into by the ManagingCommittee of the Gurdwaras within the limits of the Municipal Committee, Amritsar, which presumably hadalready by then been formed Linder section 85 of the Act. Now, quite independently of these 70 proceedingsbefere the Tribunal, and prior to the ﬁling of the list under section 3 and of the objections under section 5 abovereferred to, there had been ﬁled a petition under section 7 of the Act, signed by 55 Sikhs, claiming these veryproperties as being in themselves a Sikh Gurdwara by name Bunga Sarkar (Maharaja Ranjit Singh Saheb) andenclosing a list of properties as belonging thereto under section 7(2) -of the Act. It does not appear that thispetition was brought to the notice of the Gurdwara Tribunal when it passed the decree in terms of the compromisewith reference to the objections under section 5 of the Act. The petition under section 7 was in the usual coursefollowed by a notiﬁcation issued by the Government on the 18th February, 1930, under section 7(3) of the Act. Thisresulted in (1) an objection under section 8 by the Granthis objecting that this was not a Sikh Gurdwara, and (2)two other objections by Sardar Raghbir Singh and Sardar Balwant Singh, already previously above referred to,under section 10 of the Act claiming the properties as their own and objecting to the claim made that they wereSikh Gurdwaras.These objections were ﬁled on the 5th April, 1930. It may be noticed that the notiﬁcation under section 7(3) of theAct was within a few days after the compromise decrees in the proceedings under section 5 of the Act and it doesnot appear whether the compromises were brought to the notice of the Government or not. These objectionsunder sections 8 and 10 (and presumably also the petition under section 7) were forwarded to the Tribunal for itsdecision under section 14 of the Act. The petition under section 8 ﬁled by the Granthis was contested by the.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/19.h/0209595wwwiiofindirasee95tml26 9/12/2SHIROMANI GUR DWARA PARBANDHAKCOMMITTEE V. L T.

On theobjections under section 10;notices were given to the Committee of Manaaement as well as to the Shiromani Gurdwara ParbandhakCommittee but they declined to become parties to it. The contest under section 10 of the Act 71 was only asbetween the claimants and some of the Sikhs who ﬁled the petition under section 7. At the hearing before theTribunal both sides relied upon the previous compromises in support of their respective claims. The Tribunal by itsdecision dated the 4th November, 1935, decided that the properties which had been declared as the properties ofSardar Raghbir Singh and Sardar Balwant Singh respectively, should be declared to be their personal propertiesand that the rest of the properties claimed to belong to Bunga Sarkar and Bunga Mai Mallan should be declared tobe Sikh Gurdwaras and as properties appurtenant thereto. It was also declared that these two Gurdwaras and theproperties held to be appurtenant to them should vest in the management of Sardar Raghbir Singh and SardarBalwant Singh by virtue of and as per terms of the compromises. As against these decrees two appeals werepresented by the Sikh worshippers to the High Court and the only question that ultimately appears to have beenraised was that the direction given by the Tribunal to the eﬀect that the properties should remain in themanagement of the claimants, Sardar Raghbir Singh and Sardar Balwant Singh, was illegal. The High Courtwithout giving any decision on the legal question so raised was of the opinion that it was no function of the SikhGurdwara Tribunal to pass an order on an application made under section 10 by the claimants that the claimantsshould manage the properties appurtenant to the Gurdwaras by virtue of the compromises. They thought that thequestion of right of management should be left open in these proceedings and that the directions in the decree ofthe Tribunal relating to the management should be deleted therefrom and that the rest of the decrees of the SikhGurdwara Tribunal is to stand. They expressed their conclusion in the following terms:"" That portion of the decree of the Sikh Gurdwara s Tribunal which has declared the respondents' right to managethe Gurdwaras and the properties appended thereto shall form no part of the decree granted by the Tribunal; therest of the decree of the Sikh Gur- 72 dwaras Tribunal stands, that is to say, the properties which have beendeclared to be the personal properties of Sardar Raghbir Singh and Sardar Balwant Singh shall remain theirproperties and the properties which have been declared to be appended to the two Gurdwaras shall remain theproperties of the two Gurdwaras"".The High Court also added that though the proceedings mentioned the existence of two Gurdwaras by nameBunga Sarkar and Bunga Mai Mallan, the real position seemed to be that there was only one Gurdwara, viz. BungaSarkar, and that Bunga Mai Mallan had no separate existence as a Gurdwara but was a well-known part of BungaSarkar. This decision of the High Court was on the 16th June, 1936. This was followed by notiﬁcation No. 9-G datedthe 3rd March, 1937, under section 17 of the Act which is the foundation of the present suit.On these facts a number of contentions were raised by both sides before the High Court as well as before us. Thejudgment of the High Court as well as the arguments before us have covered a wide range. On the merits, the casefor the plaintiﬀ is quite simple. The plaintiﬀ says that whatever may be the position with reference to the earliercompromises arrived at between the parties in the proceedings under section 5 of the Act, the later proceedingswith reference to those very properties under section 10 of the Act resulted in the judgment of the High Courtdated the 16th June 1936, which is conclusive and binding. By virtue of the said judgment and the notiﬁcationdated the 3rd March, 1937, following thereupon, the plaintiﬀ is entitled to possession of the properties by virtue ofsection 25-A of the Act. On the side of the defendants various objections have been raised which may besummarised as follows: (1) The proceedings under section 10 did not result in any speciﬁc declaration in favour ofthe Committee that the properties in dispute in the present suit constituted a Sikh Gurdwara or belong to a SikhGurdwara.No such declaration can-be gathered from the decision of the Tribunal dated the 4th November, 1935, or from thatof 73 the High Court on appeal dated the 16th June, 1936. (2) The Tribunal had no jurisdiction in disposing of anapplication under section 10 of the Act, to give a positive declaration that the property in question is a SikhGurdwara. Its only function was to decide whether or not the properties claimed were the private properties of theclaimants. Hence even if the decision of the Tribunal and of the High Court can be treated as a decision declaringthe properties as a Sikh Gurdwara that is not valid and the notiﬁcation issued thereupon is void. (3) Any suchdecision would be contrary to section 37 of the Act and also contrary to the principles of res judicata and would be,therefore, a nullity on that ground. (4) The conduct of the Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and the concernedCommittee of Management, in entering into the compromises in the proceedings under section 5 of the Actwithout disclosing the pendency of the petition ﬁled by the 55 Sikhs under section 7 of the Act, followed up by.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/19.h/0209595wwwiiofindirasee95tml36 9/12/2SHIROMANI GUR DWARA PARBANDHAKCOMMITTEE V. L T. SARDAR RAGHBIR SINGH & ORS [15] INSC 19; AIR 15 SC 4…their declining to be made parties in the section 10 proceedings and in virtually promoting the contest of theproceedings under sections 8 and 10, was fraudulent. They are accordingly estopped from relying on the decreeobtained under section 10 proceedings and basing their right to relief thereon. (5) The suit under section 25-A liesonly where the decision on an objection under section 10(1) is reached after the notiﬁcation that the Gurdwara is aSikh Gurdwara is published since the section refers to. a decision in favour of a "" Notiﬁed Sikh Gurdwara"" implyingthe pre-existence of such notiﬁcation. (6) The suit under section 25-A was barred by limitation. (7) The wholeappeal abated in the High Court inasmuch as one of the respondents, Sardar Balwant Singh died during thependency of the appeal.His legal representatives were not brought on record in time and the High Court declined to excuse the delay andto set aside the abatement, as a result of which the entire appeal abated, the claim against both the respondentsbeing joint and not being maintainable against one only in the absence of 10 74 the other. In addition to thesecontentions which have been put forward before us and strenuously argued by both sides, the High Court alsobased its decision on the view that section 7 of the Act assumes the existence of a Gurdwara and that a notiﬁcationissued under section 7 (3) without there being in fact a Gurdwara in existence would be ultra vires.In the present case, in view of the prior proceedings under section 5 and the compromises following thereupon,the non- existence of the Gurdwara as claimed in the petition under section 7(1) must be taken to have been madeout and therefore the notiﬁcation and all the proceedings following thereupon are illegal and ultra vires.Though we have heard elaborate arguments from both sides on these various contentions, it appeared to usultimately that the plea of limitation is decisive against the appellants and that it is unnecessary to express anyopinion on any of the other contentions raised. The question of limitation arises with reference to the terms ofsection 25-A which is as follows:"" 25-A. (1) When it has been decided under the provisions of this Act that a right, title or interest in immovableproperty belongs to a Notiﬁed Sikh Gurdwara , or any person, the Committee of the Gurdwara concerned or theperson in whose favour a declaration has been made may, within a period of one year from the date of the decisionor the date of the constitution of the Committee, whichever is later, institute a suit before a tribunal claiming to beawarded possession of the right, title or interest in the immovable property in question as against the parties tothe previous petition, and the tribunal shall if satisﬁed that the claim relates to the right, title or interest in theimmovable property which has been held to belong to the Gurdwara, or to the person in whose favour thedeclaration has been made, pass a decree for possession accordingly.(2)Notwithstanding anything contained in any -Act to the contrary, the court-fee payable on the plaint in such suitshall be ﬁve rupees"".75 This section provides, for the ﬁling of the suit, the period of one year from the date of the decision or the date ofthe constitution of the committee whichever is later.Now the date of the decision in this case must be taken to be the date when the High Court on appeal disposed ofthe proceedings under section 10, i.e., the 16th June, 1936.The present suit has been ﬁled on the 25th February, 1938, i.e., clearly beyond one year of the decision. Thequestion for consideration, therefore, is whether the suit can be said to have been within one year from the date ofthe constitution of the Committee of the Gurdwara concerned.Now, one has to turn to sections 85, 86 and 88 of the Act to appreciate which is, the Committee concerned withthis Gurdwara and what the date of its constitution is. Section 85 is as follows (in so far as it is relevant):"" Subject to the provisions of section 88, there shall be one committee for the Gurdwaras known as the DarbarSahib, Amritsar, and the Baba Atal Sahib, and all other Notiﬁed Sikh Gurdwaras situated within the municipalboundaries of Amritsar other than the Sri Akal Takht Sahib"".Section 86 is as follows (in so far as it is relevant):"" For every Notiﬁed Sikh Gurdwara other than a Gurdwara speciﬁed in section 85 a committee shall be constitutedafter it has been declared to be a Sikh Gurdwara under the provisions of this Act"".Section 88 is as follows (in so far as it is relevant):.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/19.h/0209595wwwiiofindirasee95tml46 9/12/2SHIROMANI GUR DWARA PARBANDHAKCOMMITTEE V. L T. SARDAR RAGHBIR SINGH & ORS [15] INSC 19; AIR 15 SC 4…"" (1)The committees described in sections 85 and 86 shall be constituted as soon as may be after the constitution ofthe Board, provided that no committee shall be constituted for any gurdwara under the provisions of this Actunless and until it has been declared to be a Sikh Gurdwara under the provisions of this Act.(2)When all the members of any committee described in section 85 have been elected or co-opted, as the casemay be, according to the provisions of that section, the Provincial Government shall notify the fact that thecommittee has been duly constituted, 76 and the date of the publication of the notiﬁcation shall be deemed to bethe date of the constitution of the committee "".Now, it is not disputed that the present plaintiﬀ which is the Committee of Management for all the Gurdwarassituated within the Municipal limits of Amritsar, except the Gurdwara Sri Akal Takht Sahib was constituted prior tothe year 1930 and was in fact functioning at the date of the compromises in the section 5 proceedings dated the6th February, 1930.It is also not disputed that by virtue of section 85(2), this committee also became the Committee concerned withthe suit Gurdwara, which is admittedly located within the Municipal limits of Amritsar. But it is contended for theappellants that this Committee becomes concerned with the suit Gurdwara only from the date when thenotiﬁcation under section 17 is issued, i.e., from the 3rd March, 1937, and that, therefore,, the plaintiﬀ had one yearfrom that date for the ﬁling of the suit and that in the situation, section 25-A in providing the alternative period oflimitation as being "" one year from the date of the constitution of the committee"", must be construed reasonablyas being one year from the date of the notiﬁcation in such a case and that for the purposes of this section, the pre-existing committee must be deemed to have been constituted for the suit Gurdwara only on the date of thenotiﬁcation.In support of this contention it has been pointed out that the speciﬁc policy of the Act as disclosed in sections 86and 88 is that no Committee is to be formed for a Gurdwara until after' it has been declared a Sikh Gurdwara underthe provisions of the Act. It is accordingly urged that the phrase "" constitution of the committee"" in section 25-Ashould be construed so as to indicate a point of time not earlier than the notiﬁcation of the concerned Gurdwaraand that in the circumstances and in such cases the date of the notiﬁcation of the Gurdwara must be the date ofthe constitution of the concerned committee. It appears to us, however, that this contention is untenable. Section86 in terms relates to a Notiﬁed Sikh Gurdwara other than Gurdwaras 77 speciﬁed in section 85. Hence so far as ourpresent purpose is concerned, the policy underlying section 86 does not necessarily apply to the Gurdwaras withinthe Municipal limits of Amritsar for which a Committee already exists.Moreover, sub-section (2) of section 88 provides with reference to Committees under section 85, that, as soon asall the members described therein have been elected or co- opted, the fact should be duly notiﬁed, and alsodeclares in clear and categorical terms that the date of the publication of the notiﬁcation shall be deemed to bethe date of the constitution of the Committee. In the face of this deeming provision relating to these committees,it is not permissible to impute to such a Committee any other date as the date of its constitution for any of thepurposes of the Act and to imply an exception and an addendum to the speciﬁc deeming provision. This would belegislating. We cannot, therefore, accept the contention of the appellant that the date of the notiﬁcation undersection 17 in the present case should be deemed to be the date of the constitution of the Committee concerned forthe purposes of section 25-A. It has been urged that this view deprives the Committee of the beneﬁt of the longeralternative period of limitation and that in a case where no notiﬁcation under section 17 has been issued until afterthe expiry of an year from the date of the ﬁnal decision that the Gurdwara claimed is a Sikh Gurdwara, the remedyunder section 25-A would become inapplicable. It may be that an exceptional case of undue delay in thepublication of the notiﬁcation may be a casus omissus but such a delay need not be assumed to be a matter ofcourse. That, at any rate, is not the present case where the notiﬁcation was in fact issued within nine months ofthe decision of the High Court. The Committee which should have been alert with reference to these matters, had,not only the whole of these nine months to take steps to get the notiﬁcation published earlier, but, it had threemonths thereafter to come forward with the present suit. However this may be, we do not consider that there isany question of hardship, 78 because obviously section 25-A is only an enabling section providing a cheap remedyby way of a suit before the Tribunal itself. We are clearly of the opinion that the present suit under section 25-A isbarred by limitation and on this ground the appeal must fail.The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/19.h/0209595wwwiiofindirasee95tml56 9/12/2SHIROMANI GUR DWARA PARBANDHAKCOMMITTEE V.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This appeal and Civil Appeal No. 12 of 1954,which will also be governed by this judgment, raise the same points though there are some diﬀerences in the facts.We will deal with Civil Appeal No. 260 of 1953 ﬁrst.The suit there related to an arbitration matter. The appellant before us, whom it will be convenient to call thecontractor, entered into a contract with the Dominion of India through an Additional Chief Engineer of theC.P.W.D.on 1-11-1945 for the supply of bricks to the C.P.W.D., a department of the Dominion Government. Disputes aroseabout a number of matters. Clause 14 of the agreement provided that all disputes arising out of or relating to thecontract should be referred to the Superintending Engineer of the Circle for the time being. Accordingly, there wasa reference on 21-1-1949 and an award followed on 8-5-1949.It was ﬁled in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, and the contractor prayed that it be accepted andthat a decree be passed in terms of it. The Dominion of India ﬁled objections under section 30 of the ArbitrationAct, 1940 and prayed that the award be set aside and alternatively that it be modiﬁed or corrected. Thecontractor's application was registered as a suit under section 20(2) of the Act and a decree was passed in terms ofthe award on 18-3-1950.By that time the Constitution had come into force and the Union of India replaced the Dominion of India as adefendant. The Union of India ﬁled an appeal to the High Court. The appeal was allowed in part. The contractorthereupon appealed to this Court.The dispute that was referred to the arbitrator consisted of 17 heads of claim but only three of them are contestedhere, namely items 5, 8 and 17.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/20./1095rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html2 9/12/ 2020SETH THAWARDAS PHERUMAL V. THE UNION OF INDIA [15] INSC 20 (24 Mah 15)51 In the 5th head of claim the contractor claimed Rs. 75,900 as the price of 88 lacs of katcha bricks that weredestroyed by rain. These bricks were not the subject-matter of the contract but the contractor put his claim in thisway.The contract was for the supply of 2-1/2 crores of pucca bricks which bad to be delivered according to the followingschedule- 30 lacs by 25-1-46 50 lacs by 25-2-46 55 lacs by 25-3-46 55 lacs by 25-4-46 60 lacs by 25-5-46.Delivery was to be at the kiln site. In order to keep to this schedule the contractor bad to think ahead and work to aparticular time table. First, he had to prepare katcha or unbaked bricks and place them in his kilns for baking.While this lot was baking be had to prepare and stock another lot of katcha bricks ready to take the place of thebaked bricks as soon as they were removed. It was the duty of the C.P.W.D. to remove these bricks as soon as theywere ready for delivery,that is to say, as soon as they were fully baked. At a certain stage of the contract theC.P.W.D. failed to remove the baked bricks which were ready for delivery and removal. This caused a jam in thekilns and prevented the contractor from placing a fresh stock of unburnt bricks in the kilns, and in the meanwhilehis stock pile of katcha bricks ready for baking kept on mounting up.Had everything been done to time the 2-1/2 crores of bricks would have been delivered before the rains set in. Butowing to the default of the C.P.W.D. in not removing the burnt bricks which were ready for removal, delay occurredin the time table and the rains set in with the result that88 lacs of katcha bricks were destroyed by the rains. As thisloss was occasioned by the default of the C.P.W.D. the contractor claimed that be should be paid their price.The reply of the Union Government was two-fold. First, it contended that the katcha bricks formed no part of thecontract and even if it was at fault in not 52 taking delivery of the burnt bricks in time all that it could be held liablefor would be for breach of that contract; and said that the loss that was occasioned by the damage caused to thekatcha bricks which formed no part of the contract was too remote. Secondly, that compensation for this losscould not in any event be claimed because this kind of situation was envisaged by the parties when the contractwas made and they expressly stipulated that the Dominion Government would not be responsible. The UnionGovernment relied on additional clause 6 of the agreement which is in these terms:""The department will not entertain any claim for idle labour or for damage to unburnt bricks due to any causewhatsoever"".The arbitrator held that this clause was not meant ""to absolve the department from carrying out their part of thecontract"" and so he awarded the contractor Rs. 64,075 under this head.We are clear that the arbitrator went wrong in law.Government departments have their diﬃculties no less than contractors. There is trouble with labour, there is thelikelihood of machinery breaking down in out of the way places and so forth; there was also the danger of thunderstorms and heavy showers of rain in the month of May: it will be remembered that the last date of delivery was 25-5-46. if, with that in view, Government expressly stipulated, and the contractor expressly agreed, that Governmentwas not to be liable for any loss occasioned by a consequence as remote as this, then that is an express term of thecontract and the contractor must be tied down to it. If he chose to contract in absolute terms that was his aﬀair.But having contracted he cannot go back on his agreement simply because it does not suit him to abide by it. Thisis not to say that Government is absolved from all liability, but all it can be held responsible for is for damagesoccasioned by the breach of its contract to remove the pucca bricks which it had undertaken to remove. But whatwould such a breach entail? 53 The contractor had a duty under section 73 of the Contract Act to minimise the loss,accordingly he would have had the right to remove the bricks himself and stack them elsewhere and claimcompensation for the loss so occasioned; and indeed two of his heads of claim (not in dispute here) relate to that.He has been awarded Rs. 11,744-11-0 under claim No. 4 for the extra load in connection with the stacking of I crore7 lacs of bricks due to the accumulation at the kiln site owing to the department's failure to work to its part of thetime table, and in addition, he has been given Rs. 15,500 under claim 13 for the cost of levelling and dressing landto enable him to stack these extra bricks.Alternatively, he could have sold the bricks in the market and claimed the diﬀerence in price, but ordinarily hecould not have claimed compensation for damage done to the katcha bricks unless he could have shown that thatkind of damage, ordinarily too remote, was expressly contemplated by the parties when the contract was made:g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/20./1095rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html3 9/12/ 2020SETH THAWARDAS PHERUMAL V. THE UNION OF INDIA [15] INSC 20 (24 Mah 15)section 73 of the Contract Act. Here it is clear that this was in their express contemplation and they chose toprovide against such a contingency by making clause 6 an express clause in their contract. There can therefore beno doubt that the arbitrator was wrong in his law. His construction of the terms of the contract was at fault. Thequestion now arises whether his decision on this point is ﬁnal despite it being wrong in law.In India this question is governed by section 16(1) (c) of the Arbitration Act of 1940 which empowers a Court toremit an award for reconsideration ""where an objection to the legality of the award is apparent upon the face ofit"".This covers cases in which an error of law appears on the face of the award. But in determining what such an erroris, a distinction must be drawn between cases in which a question of law is speciﬁcally referred and those in whicha decision on a question of law is incidentally material (however necessary) in order to decide the question actuallyreferred. If a question of law is speciﬁcally referred and it is evident that the 54 parties desire to have a decisionfrom the arbitrator about that rather than one from the Courts, then the Courts will not interfere, though eventhere, there is authority for the view that the Courts will interfere if it is apparent that the arbitrator has actedillegally in reaching his decision, that is to say, if he has decided on inadmissible evidence or on principles ofconstruction that the law- does not countenance or something of that nature. See the speech of Viscount Cave inKelantan Government v. Duﬀ Development Co.(1) at page 409. But that is not a matter which arises in this case.The law about this is, in our opinion, the same in England as here and the principles that govern this class of casehave been reviewed at length and set out with clarity by the House of Lords in F. B. Absalom Ltd. v. Great Western(London) Garden Village Society(1) and in Kelantan Government v. Duﬀ Development Co.(1). In Durga Prasad v.Sewkishendas (3) the Privy Council applied the law expounded in Absalom's case(2) to India: see also ChampseyBhara & Co.v. Jivraj Balloo Spinning and Weaving Co.(4) and Saleh Mahomed Umer Dossal v. Nathoomal kessamal (5). Thewider language used by Lord Macnaghten in Ghulam Jilani v.Muhammad Hassan(1) bad reference to the revisional powers of the High Court under the Civil Procedure Codeand must be conﬁned to the facts of that case where the question of law involved there, namely limitation, wasspeciﬁcally referred. An arbitrator is not a conciliator and cannot ignore the law or misapply it in order to do whathe thinks is just and reasonable. He is a tribunal selected by the parties to decide their disputes according to lawand so is bound to follow and apply the law, and if he does not, he can be set right by the Courts provided his errorappears on the face of the award The single exception to this is when the parties choose speciﬁcally to refer aquestion of law as a separate and distinct matter.(1) [ 1923] A.C. 395.(2) [ 1933] A.C. 592.(3) 54 C.W.N. 74, 79.(4) 50 I.A. 324, 330 & 331.(5) 54 I.A. 427, 430.(6) 29 I.A. 51, 60.55 Reference was made to a decision of this Court in A. M. Mair & Co. v. Gordhandass Sagarmull(1) where Fazl Ali,J. quoted a passage from Viscount Simon's speech in Heyman v. Darwins Ltd."") where the learned Lord Chancellor(Viscount Simon) in turn, quoted from Lord Dunedin in another case. It was argued on the basis of this that if youhave to have recourse to the contract to establish your case, then the dispute must fall within the arbitrationclause. That is undeniable but it is not enough that the dispute should fall within the clause. It is also necessarythat the parties should deﬁne what the dispute is and agree to refer the dispute so set out and deﬁned toarbitration, or, if they do not, that the Court should compel them to do so: (see Lord Macmillan in Heyman'scase(1) just cited at pages 369 and 370). If, therefore, no speciﬁc question of law is referred, either by agreement orby compulsion, the decision of the arbitrator on that is not ﬁnal however much it may be within his jurisdiction,and indeed essential, for him to decide the question incidentally. Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Wright wereboth in the earlier case, F. R. Absalom Ltd. v.

We stress the word ""speciﬁcally"" becauseparties who make a reference to arbitration have the right to insist that the tribunal of their choice shall decidetheir dispute according to law, so before the right can be denied to them in any particular matter, the Court mustbe very sure that both sides wanted the decision of the arbitrator on a point of law rather than that of the Courtsand that they wanted his decision oil that point to be ﬁnal.(1) [ 1950] INSC 33; 1950 S.C.R. 792 at 798.

B(1), in which the contractor summarised his claims. Thedocument is not dated. On receipt of this, someone on behalf of the C.P.W.D. invoked the jurisdiction of thearbitrator. That letter has not been ﬁled. The arbitrator then wrote to the contractor and asked him to submit astatement of claim. That letter has not been ﬁled either but reference is made to it in Ex. C(1), the statement claimwhich the contractor ﬁled in response to that letter. As the material documents setting out the terms of referenceare not here, we were asked by both sides to infer what the terms were from this statement of claim and therecitals in the award. The learned counsel for the contractor relied on the following:In the statement of claim- ""Item 5.-Loss of katcha bricks............ Rs. 75,900.The chief reason of the destruction of these bricks was the failure of the department to lift the 57 monthly quota ofbricks The argument of the department that they are not liable to compensate us on this account because ofclause 6 of the agreement is not correct.Clause 6 refers to only such cases over which the department has no control. But if the department would havelifted the bricks (this was entirely under their control) then no such loss would have occurred. Also be it noted thatclause 6 refers only to 'damage' and not to 'destruction.........Damage means only partial loss.............it cannot mean total destruction.:The award states- ""The statement of claims submitted by the contractor contains seventeen items in respect ofwhich the contractor claimed a total payment of Rs. 4,76,138-12-0 plus interest i.e., approximate total amountclaimed: Rs. 5,03,803-12-0 as detailed below"".Then follow the seventeen items of which item 5 is- ""Payment for katcha bricks destroyed by rain: Rs. 75,900"".The body of the award deals with this as follows:"" Claim No. 5.Payment for 88. lacs of katcha bricks destroyed by rain.The contractor argued etc The Executive Engineer stated .........The C.P.W.D. moreover were safeguarded by clause6 of the contract............g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/20./1095rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html5 9/12/ 2020SETH THAWARDAS PHERUMAL V. THE UNION OF INDIA [15] INSC 20 (24 Mah 15)The contractor maintained that clause 6 of the contract could not be invoked when the department was at fault asin this case. Clause 6 was meant to cover contingencies which were not of the department's own making.I hold that the removal of the bricks in such a manner or to prevent accumulation in excess of 60 lacs was animplied contractual obligation on the part of the C.P.W.D........ I further hold that the C.P.W.D. cannot take shelterbehind clause 6 of the contract. This clause is not, in my opinion, meant 8 58 to absolve the department fromcarrying out their part of the contract. It is impossible not to admit this without oﬀending the rudiments ofcommon sense reasoning"".We are of opinion that this is not the kind of speciﬁc reference on a point of law that the law of arbitration requires.In the ﬁrst place, what was shown to us is no reference at all. It is only an incidental matter introduced by theDominion Government to repel the claim made by the contractor in general terms under claim No. 5.In the next place, this was the submission of the contractor alone. A reference requires the assent of both sides. Ifone side is not prepared to submit a given matter to arbitration when there is an agreement between them that itshould be referred, then recourse must be had to the Court under section 20 of the Act and the recalcitrant partycan then be compelled to submit the matter under sub-section (4). In the absence of either, agreement by bothsides about the terms of reference, or an order of the Court under section 20(4) compelling a reference, thearbitrator is not vested with the necessary exclusive jurisdiction.Therefore, when a question of law is the point at issue, unless both sides speciﬁcally agree to refer it and agree tobe bound by the arbitrator's decision, the jurisdiction of the Courts to set an arbitration right when the error isapparent on the face of the award is not ousted. The mere fact that both parties submit incidental argumentsabout a point of law in the course of the proceedings is not enough.The language of Lord Wright in F. R. Absalom Ltd. v. Great Western (London ) Garden Village Society(1), a casesimilar to this so far as this point is concerned, is apposite here- ""There is here no submission of any speciﬁcquestion of law as such and as a speciﬁc question of law; no doubt incidentally, and indeed necessarily, thearbitrator will have to decide some questions on the construction of the building contract, but. the two matterssubmitted are both composite questions of law and fact; there is no express submission of the (1) [ 1933] A.C. 592,616.59 true eﬀect of the contract on the basis of undisputed facts, as in the Kelantan case(1) or as a separate anddistinct matter on facts to be separately assumed or found, as in In re King and Duveen(2)..........The arbitrator wasnot being asked simply and speciﬁcally to decide, upon some agreed or assumed basis of fact, the trueinterpretation of either clause 26 or clause 30 of the conditions or of both together; he was being required to makean award on the two matters submitted on whatever questions of fact and law might emerge"".Clause 32 of the contract in the House of Lords case was the equivalent of clause 14 in ours. It ran- ""Providedalways that in case any dispute or diﬀerence shall arise ............. as to the construction of the contract or as to anymatter or thing arising thereunder............ such dispute shall be and is hereby referred to the arbitration and ﬁnaldecision of etc."" The arbitrator relied on that to invest him with juris- diction to determine,, as a matter of law, theconstruction of clauses 26-30 of that contract. The House of Lords held that in the absence of a speciﬁc referenceabout the construction of the contract the jurisdiction of the Courts was not taken away. Lord Russell of Killowenput it this way at page 610- ""No speciﬁc question of construction or of law was submitted. The parties had,however, been ordered to deliver pleadings, and by their statement of claim the contractor had claimed that thearbitrator should under his powers revise the last certiﬁcate issued etc...... It is at this point that the question of theconstruction of condition 30 arose as a question of law, not speciﬁcally submitted, but material in the decision ofthe matters which bad been submitted. This question of law the arbitrator has decided; but if upon the face of theaward he has decided it wrongly his decision is, in my opinion, open to review by the Court"".That is exactly the position here. Simply because the matter was referred to incidentally in the plead- (1) [ 1923]C. 395. (2) [ 1913] UKLawRpKQB 40; [ 1913] 2 K.B. 32, 36. A.60 ings and arguments in support of, or against, the general issue about liability for damages, that is not enough toclothe the arbitrator with exclusive jurisdiction on a point of law.The next question is whether the error is apparent on the face of the award. That; in our opinion, is clear from thepassages we have quoted from the award.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/20./1095rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html6 9/12/ 2020SETH THAWARDAS PHERUMAL V. THE UNION OF INDIA [15] INSC 20 (24 Mah 15)We hold that clause 6 expressly relieves the Union Government of all liability under this head of claim and that thearbitrator was wrong in awarding any sum on that account.The next head in dispute is item No. 8 in the statement of claim:""Cost of additional wages paid to the coolies on account of non-supply of ration and cloth-Rs. 51,495"".Here again no speciﬁc question of law was referred, so all we have to see is whether there is an error of lawapparent on the face of the award.The contractor put his case as follows in the statement of claim:""At the time when this work was allotted to us there was rationing system in the locality. As per conditions ofcontract we were bound not to employ local labour and we had to import coolies from far oﬀ places. We had in ouremploy about 1800 coolies and it was an impossibility to arrange their ration from open market. This diﬃculty wasbrought to the notice of the authorities concerned, and they promised us to supply ration. It was only after thispromise that we signed the agreement..... From a perusal of these letters it is clear that the department promisedus to supply ration............... These circumstantial evidences are suﬃcient enough to show that there was a mutualunderstanding between the parties that ration will be supplied. In the eyes of law even circumstantial evidence issuﬃcient to prove that such a promise was made. Any breach of that promise makes the department legally liableto compensate for that loss.......... Apart from the legal responsibility it was also a moral responsibility for thedepartment to supply ration"".61 This claim, therefore, was not grounded on any clause of the contract, nor was it said to be implied in the -contract.What was relied on was a collateral promise evidenced, not by the contract, but by two letters written by ""thedepartment"" and a promise by ""the authorities concerned"";and later this promise is turned into a ""mutual understanding"" and to a ""moral responsibility"" in addition to a legalone.The arbitrator dealt with this as follows. He began by saying- ""The contractor stated that when he submitted histender on 25-9-45 he did so in the bona ﬁde belief that the department would make the necessary arrangements,etc."" Then he sets out the following dates. On 1-11-45 the contractor was told that his tender had been accepted.On 9-11-45 the contractor ""warned"" the Executive Engineer about his ""immediate requirements in respect ofrations"". The contract was ﬁnally accepted and signed on 22-11-45.Now it is admitted that the contract contains no clause about rations and it is also evident that the question wasnot raised when the tender was accepted on behalf of the Dominion Government. The question was raised in aletter to the Executive Engineer, and the contractor signed the contract without waiting for a reply.It is well settled that governments can only be bound by contracts that are entered into in a particular way andwhich are signed by the proper authority. A reference to the agreement, Ex. A(1), will show that it was accepted onbehalf of the Dominion Government by the Additional Chief Engineer and not by an Executive Engineer. A letterwritten to the Executive Engineer would therefore have no eﬀect and even if it be assumed that the letter wasforwarded to the Additional Chief Engineer for consideration, what does it amount to? A tender embodyingcertain terms is submitted and is accepted on 1-11-45. Both sides are agreed on all matters contained in it and theirconduct shows that both sides indicated that the contract should be reduced to writing. Be- 62 fore the agreementis signed, one party wants to include a further condition in the contract. We will assume that the request was madeto the other contracting party. But without waiting for the assent of the other side, both sides accept and sign thecontract as it existed before the fresh suggestion was made. It is an error in law to deduce from this that there wasacceptance of the fresh proposal. On the contrary, the legal conclusion is that the new suggestion was droppedand that the contractor was content to accept the contract as it was without' this condition.In any case, a person cannot be bound by a one-sided oﬀer which is never accepted, particularly when the partiesintend that the contract should be reduced to writing. That is the whole point of insisting on a document. Itexcludes speculation as to what was and what was not agreed to however much the matter might have beenraised by one of the parties during the stage of negotiation.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/20./1095rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html7 9/12/ 2020SETH THAWARDAS PHERUMAL V. THE UNION OF INDIA [15] INSC 20 (24 Mah 15)The arbitrator continues that the contractor stated that- ""it was a well known and established fact that Sindri wasa rationed area; that the C.P.W.D. were giving rations at controlled rates to their employees and contractorsthrough arrangements with the local Civil Supply Authorities; that nobody working under the C.P.W.D. wasallowed to make independent arrangements or approach the Civil Supply Authorities direct"" and the contractorcontended that the very fact that he tendered such low rates showed that he expected to supply his labourers withrations at controlled rates. The arbitrator then sets out some more of the contractor's contentions and from themconcludes that ""there was an implied contractual obligation for the C.P.W.D. to make available controlled rationsto the contractor and that this obligation was not fulﬁlled with due diligence and care"".He accordingly awarded Rs. 40,000 as compensation under this head.The error is apparent. -Facts must be based either on evidence or on admissions; they cannot be found to 63 existfrom a mere contention by one side especially when they are expressly denied by the other. The inference fromthe facts stated above is that the contractor entered into the agreement with his eyes open and whatever his one-sided hopes may have been he was content to enter into the agreement as it stood without binding the other sideto the new conditions and without even waiting to ascertain the reaction of the other side to his further proposals.It has to be remembered that rationing was not a matter that was under the direction and control of the DominionGovernment. It was a local matter handled by the then Provincial authorities and under their direction andcontract. The C.P.W.D., as a department of the Dominion Government, was not concerned with rationing exceptthat its employees had to submit to rationing like everybody else in the Sindri area. This confusion between theDominion Government and the Provincial Government occurs in the arbitrator's opening sentence under this headwhere he sets out the contractor's contention that ""commodities such as rations and cloth which were absolutelyessential for the maintenance of his labourers and which were under Government control"". As the arbitrator basessolely on the contractor's contentions it is evident that he failed to appreciate the fact that the DominionGovernment and the Provincial rationing authorities were separate entities distinct from one another. The positionaccordingly reduces itself to this: two persons, neither of which is a part of the Provincial Government or has anycontrol over rationing, chose to enter into an agreement for work in a rationed area. They insisted that theircontract should be reduced to writing, and that indeed was essential, this being a contract with the DominionGovernment which was incapable of contracting in any other way; they agreed upon and concluded all their terms;then, at the last minute, one side raised a point about rationing but without waiting for a reply and without havingthe term entered in the contract, he signed the contract as it stood before-the point was raised even during thenegotiation. It is 64 an error in law to hold that any contractual obligation can be inferred or implied from thesecircumstances.Then there is still another error. If this implied agreement about rations and cloth does not spring out of thewritten contract but is to be inferred collaterally as a distinct and subsidiary contract, and we gather that that isthe ﬁnding, especially as reference was made to section 9 of the Contract Act, then that is not a contract to whichthe arbitration clause can apply. Wide though it is, clause 14 is conﬁned to any matter relating to the written con-tract and if ration and cloth are not covered by the written contract, they are not matters that relate to it. If partieschoose to add a fresh contract in addition to or in substitution for the old, then the arbitration clause cannot coverthe new contract. See Lord Macmillan in Heyman v.Darwins Ltd.(1).The last item in dispute in this appeal is claim No. 17 about interest. The statement of claims sets out ""Item 17-Interest on the amount of money involved in this claim at the rate of Rs. 6 percent.Rs. 27,665.This work was ﬁnished in May 1946 and it was proper for the department to have decided all our claims at least by31st December 1947........................ But this was not done. Due to this a heavy amount remained blocked up andwe were compelled to take money from our bankers on interest.We therefore pray for interest for 16 months from 1-1-48 to 31-4-49"".The arbitrator held-- ""The contractor's contention that his claims should have been settled by January 1948 is, inmy opinion, reasonable.I therefore award interest at 6% for 16 months on the total amount of the awards given i.e., Rs. 17,363"".g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/20./1095rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html8 9/12/ 2020SETH THAWARDAS PHERUMAL V. THE UNION OF INDIA [15] INSC 20 (24 Mah 15)Then the arbitrator sets out the amounts awarded under each head of claim. A perusal of them shows that eachbead relates to a claim for an unliquidated sum. The Interest Act, 1839 applies, as interest is (1) [ 1942] A.C. 356 at371.65 not otherwise payable by law in this kind of case (see Bengal Nagpur Ry. Co. v. Ruttanji Ramji(1)), but even if itbe assumed that an arbitrator is a ""court"" within the meaning of that Act, (a fact that by no means appears to bethe case), the following among other conditions must be fulﬁlled before interest can be awarded under the Act:-(1) there must be a debt or a sum certain;(2) it must be payable at a certain time or other- wise;(3) these debts or sums must be payable by virtue of some written contract at a certain time;(4) There must have been a demand in writing stating that interest will be demanded from the date of thedemand.Not one of these elements is present, so the arbitrator erred in law in thinking that he had the power to allowinterest simply because he thought the demand was reasonable.It was suggested that at least interest from the date of ""suit"" could be awarded on the analogy of section 34 of theCivil Procedure Code, 1908. But section 34 does not apply because an arbitrator is not a ""court"" within the meaningof the Code nor does the Code apply to arbitrators, and, but for section 34, even a Court would not have the powerto give interest after the suit. This was, therefore, also rightly struck out from the award.We pause to note that there was only a delay of ﬁve days at the outside in the over-all picture. The last date forremoval of the last instalment of bricks was 25-5-46 and the contractor says under this head that the wholecontract was completed by the end of May, 1946. It is diﬃcult-to see how 88 lacs of bricks could have beendamaged by rain in the last ﬁve days of May, and if the damage occurred before it would have occurred anyway,for on the contractor's case he had to have a large stack of unbaked bricks on hand ready to enter the kilns in orderto keep pace with his time table.However, that was a (1) 65 I.A. 66.9 66 matter within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and is not a matter in which the Courts can interfere.That concludes Civil Appeal No. 260 of 1953 and we now turn to the other appeal, Civil Appeal No. 12 of 1954. Onlytwo items are in dispute here. Heads 4 and 17 of the claim.The over-all pattern of the claim is the same as in the other case. There was a contractor and he entered into anagreement containing the same terms and conditions, except about the details of supply. It was signed on thesame day as the other and by the same authority on behalf of the Dominion Government., and the matter wentbefore the same arbitrator and the award in this case was given on 1-5-1949, one week before the other award.Here also, no speciﬁc question of law was referred and we need not cover the same ground. Our decision is thesame here as there.The fourth head of claim is about cloth and rations. The claim here., and the Dominion Government's reply, is thesame as in the other case, but the award in this case is not based on an implied contractual obligation but on ""amoral and implied obligation"". The error here is even greater than before. The sum claimed was Rs. 51,495 and theamount awarded was Rs. 30,000.The seventeenth head of claim was about interest. The contractor claimed Rs. 27,665 and the arbitrator awardedRs.9,954. There is the same error of law apparent on the face of the award.The High Court was right in dismissing the claims made under the heads in dispute here. The two appeals fail andeach is dismissed with costs in this Court.Appeals dismissed.g/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/20./1095rc95www.liiofindia.orasee95html9 9/12/ 2020SETH THAWARDAS PHERUMAL V.

In accordance with the order, the petitionersfurnished the security amounts directed to be deposited within the time speciﬁed in the order. The Registrar of theHigh Court did not issue any notice of admission of ' appeal to be served by the Appellant' s Solicitor on theRespondents as envisaged in rule 9 of Order XIII, S.C.R.

The Respondents ﬁrst moved theHigh Court complaining of default on the part of the appellants in due prosecution of the appeal and latter movedthe Supreme Court for action under rule 13 of Order XIII of the Supreme Court Rules. The application in the HighCourt was therefore kept pending.Held: After the grant of special leave under article 136, the Registrar of the Supreme Court transmits, inaccordance with the 244 provisions of rule 8 of Order XIII of the Supreme Court Rules, a certiﬁed copy of theSupreme Court' s order to the Court or tribunal appealed from, Rule 9 of Order XIII of the Supreme Court Rulesenjoins upon the Court or tribunal appealed from to act, in the absence of any special directions in the order, inaccordance with the provisions contained in Order XLV of the Civil Procedure Code, so far as they are applicable.Accordingly the Court or Tribunal to which the order is transmitted receives deposits on account of security for theRespondents' costs, printing costs, and any other deposits if so ordered by the Supreme Court, and sets aboutpreparing the record of the appeal for transmission to the Supreme Court. Therefore, action under rule 13 of OrderXIII, S.C.R., for rescinding the order granting special leave cannot be initiated unless the Court or tribunal appealedfrom reports to the Supreme Court that the appellant has not been diligent in taking steps to enable that Court tocarry out the directions, if any, contained in the order of the Supreme Court and to act in accordance with theprovisions of Order XLV of the Civil Procedure Code so far as applicable to appeals under Article 136 of theConstitution.In view of rule 9 of Order XIII of the Supreme Court Rules, the application of Order XLV of the Code of CivilProcedure to appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution is restricted. The Court or tribunal appealed from, nodoubt, has to carry out the directions contained in the order granting special leave, and to receive the security forthe Respondents' costs and other necessary deposits, but once the security is furnished and the other deposits aremade, the formality of "" admission"" envisaged by rule 8 of Order XLV of the Civil Procedure Code is unnecessary,.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/23.html/0209595695495www9515 9/12/2SHIVA JUTE BALING LTD.

Appealsunder Article 136 thus stand on a diﬀerent footing from appeals on grant of certiﬁcate by the High Court itself.In the letter case, the High Court has exclusive jurisdiction over the matter until it admits the appeal under rule 8 ofOrder XLV of the Civil Procedure Code.Rule 9 of Chapter 32 of the Original Side Rules of the Calcutta High Court envisages "" admission"" of appeals to theSupreme Court whether by an order of the Supreme Court or under Order XLV of the Civil Procedure Code. Andwhen an appeal arising from an order made by the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, has beenso "" admitted"", the said rule enjoins upon the Registrar to issue notice of such admission for service by theappellant on the Respondents.In cases where special leave has been granted by the Supreme Court, it is not necessary for the appellant to movethe High Court appealed from for the formal admission of his appeal. As the order granting special leave itself laysdown the conditions to be fulﬁlled by the appellants, the admission will be regarded as ﬁnal only when thedirections are complied with and as 245 soon as this is done it would be the duty of the Registrar to issue a noticeof the admission of the appeal for service upon the respondents. In default of the issue of such notice, theappellant cannot be held responsible for laches in the prosecution of his appeal with regard to the steps requiredto be taken after the admission of his appeal.","In the matter of Petition for Special Leave to Appeal No. 230 of 1953.Rajinder Narain for the Respondents.N.

The Order of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA C.J.-This is an application by the respondentsin Special Leave Petition No. 230 of 1953, praying for summons to the appellants to show cause why the specialleave obtained by the latter should not be rescinded in accordance with the provision of Order XIII, rule 13 of theSupreme Court Rules.The appeal is directed against a judgment of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court aﬃrming, on appeal, adecision of a single Judge sitting on the Original Side of that Court. The appellants, having been refused certiﬁcateby the High Court, presented before us an application under article 136 of the Constitution and special leave toappeal was granted to them by an order of this Court dated the 25th May 1954. By that order the appellants wererequired to furnish security for costs amounting to Rs. 2,500 within six weeks and the enforcement of the award,which was the subject-matter of the appeal, was stayed on condition that the appellants deposited in Court a sumof Rs. 28,000 within four weeks from the date of the order. On the 15th of June 1954 the Registrar of this Courttransmitted to the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court certiﬁed copies of the order granting special leave andalso of the special leave petition with a request that these documents might be included in the printed records ofthe case. It is not disputed that in pursuance of the directions given 246 by this Court the appellants did depositthe amount required as security for costs and also the sum of Rs. 28,000 within the time mentioned in the order.On the 29th November 1954 the respondents' Solicitors in Calcutta wrote a letter to the Registrar of the OriginalSide of the Calcutta High Court complaining of delay on the part of the appellants in prosecuting the appeal. It wasstated inter alia that although six months had elapsed since special leave was granted by this Court, therespondents were not served with notice of the admission of the appeal and no steps were taken by the appellantsto get the records printed or transmitted to this Court. In reply to this letter the Registrar informed therespondents' Solicitors that according to the practice of the Calcutta High Court it was incumbent on theappellants to make a formal application to the Appellate Bench of the Court for declaring the appeal ﬁnallyadmitted, and this was to be done on notice to the other parties under Order XLV, rule 8 of the Civil ProcedureCode and on ﬁling in Court a copy of the order of the Supreme Court granting special leave to appeal as well as theapplication upon which such order was made. Unless and until an order was made by the High Court declaring theappeal to be admitted, no action could be taken by the oﬃce in the matter.Thereupon on the 11th of January 1955 an application was ﬁled by the appellants praying that leave might be givento them to ﬁle the certiﬁed copy of the special leave petition and also that of the order passed upon it and that theappeal might be ﬁnally admitted. This application came up for hearing before the learned Chief Justice and Lahiri,J. of the Calcutta High Court and on the 20th of January 1955 the learned Judges made the following order:.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/23.html/0209595695495www9525 9/12/2SHIVA JUTE BALING LTD.

Onthe 21st June following, the Appellant furnished the necessary security. It was then the duty of the Appellant totake the necessary steps for the ﬁnal admission of the appeal in order that the preparation of the Paper Bookmight thereafter be 247 undertaken. Under the Rules and practice of this Court the step to be taken is that theAppellant to the Supreme Court should make an application for leave to ﬁle the certiﬁed copy of the petition forSpecial Leave and also a certiﬁed copy of the order granting Special Leave which have been ﬁled along with thepresent application......................."" When the matter came up for hearing on the last occasion we enquiredwhether the Appellants- had any explanation to give for the delay which bad occurred. It was said that the certiﬁedcopy of the application for Special Leave had been obtained only recently. It was however not explained why whenan application for a certiﬁed copy of the order was made a similar application for a certiﬁed copy of the petitionalso could not be made.In all the circumstances we consider it right that the disposal of the present application should stand over for amonth in order that the respondents may take such steps as they desire to take before the Supreme Court"".The above facts and order of the High Court were communicated to the Registrar of this Court by Shri RajinderNarain, Advocate for the respondents, by his letters dated the 17th and 31st of January 1965 and on the basis ofthe facts stated above, he requested that action should be initiated by the Registrar against the appellants for non-prosecution of the appeal. The Registrar told the learned Advocate that he had not received any report from theHigh Court regarding any laches on the part of the appellants and without any such report, it was not possible forhim to take any action in the matter. The Advocate himself, it was said, was quite at liberty to make a formalapplication to the Court in such way as he considered proper. The views thus expressed by the Registrar of thisCourt were communicated by him to the Registrar of the High Court, Original Side, Calcutta. On the 4th March1955 Shri Rajinder Narain ﬁled a formal petition addressed to the Registrar alleging inordinate delay on the part ofthe ap- pellants in ﬁling in the High Court certiﬁed copies of 248 the Special Leave petition and the order made bythis Court thereupon and praying that summons might be issued to the appellants to show cause why the appealshould not be dismissed for non-prosecution. Before the Registrar could take any further steps in the matter, theapplication of the appellants for ﬁnal admission of the appeal made in the High Court came up for furtherconsideration before the Appellate Bench consisting of the Chief Justice and Mr.Justice Lahiri and on the 7th March, 1955 the learned Judges made an order directing, for the reasons giventherein, adjournment of the application for admission of the appeal before them, sine die pending orders whichthis Court might pass on the application of the respondents. The application of the respondents which purports tohave been made under Order XIII, rule 13 of the Supreme Court Rules was referred by the Registrar for orders tothe Court and it has now come up for hearing before us.Shri Rajinder Narain appearing in support of the petition has Contended before us that the appellants were guiltyof serious laches inasmuch as they did not ﬁle in the High Court, till 8 months after the special leave was granted,copies of the special leave petition as well as of the order passed upon it; nor did they make an application to theAppellate Bench for admission of the appeal without which no further steps could be taken in the matter ofprinting and transmission of the record. As the appellants could not give any satisfactory explanation for thisinordinate delay on their part, the special leave, it is argued, should be rescinded. Mr. Chatterjee, who appearedfor the appellants, has contended @n the other hand that in a case like the one before us where the appeal hascome up to this Court by special leave and not by a certiﬁcate granted by the High Court, there was no duty castupon the appellants to make a formal application in the High Court for ﬁnal admission of the appeal or to ﬁletherein certiﬁed copies of the special leave petition and the order made thereupon. His argument is that underOrder XXXII, rule 9 of the Original Side Rules of the Calcutta High Court, a 249 Supreme Court appeal must bedeemed to have- been admitted by the very order of this Court granting special leave and as soon as theappellants have carried out the directions of the Supreme Court regarding furnishing of security or making ofother deposits as the case may be, it is incumbent upon the Registrar to issue a notice of the admission of theappeal for service upon the respondents. Such notice indeed has got to be served by the appellants' attorney; butas no notice was at all issued by the Registrar in the present case as is contemplated by rule 9 of Order XXXII of theOriginal Side Rules of the Calcutta High Court, no blame could attach to the appellants for not taking further stepsin the matter. The contention of Mr. Chatterjee appears to us to be wellfounded and as it seems to us that doubtshave arisen at times regarding the precise procedure to be followed in cases where an appeal comes to this Courtby special leave granted under article 136 of the Constitution, it is necessary to examine the provisions bearingupon it as are contained in the Rules of the Supreme Court or of the High Court concerned read along with therelevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/23.html/0209595695495www9535"" 9/12/2SHIVA JUTE BALING LTD. V. HINDLEY & CO. LTD. [15] INSC 23; AIR 15 SC 44; 15 (2) SCR 23 (5 Ap ril 15)Ordinarily when a High Court grants a certiﬁcate giving leave to a party to appeal to this Court, it is ,that Courtwhich retains full control and jurisdiction over the subsequent proceedings relating to the prosecution of theappeal till the appeal is ﬁnally admitted. It is for the High Court to see that its directions are carried out regardingthe furnishing of security or the making of deposit and when these conditions are fulﬁlled, it has then to declarethe appeal ﬁnally admitted under Order XLV,rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Code. The jurisdiction of the SupremeCourt begins after the appeal is ﬁnally admitted.When however the appeal comes to this Court on the strength of a special leave-' granted by it, the position isdiﬀerent. In such cases the order of the Supreme Court granting special leave by itself operates as an admission ofthe appeal as soon as the conditions in the order relating to fur- 250 nishing of security or making of a deposit arecomplied with. That this is the true position will be clear from the procedural provisions contained in the Rules ofthe Supreme Court as well as of the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court. Order XIII, rule 8 of the SupremeCourt Rules lays down:"" After the grant of special leave to appeal by the Court, the Registrar shall transmit a certiﬁed copy of the order tothe court or tribunal appealed from"".Rule 9 then says:"" On receipt of the said order, the court or tribunal appealed from shall, in the absence of any special directions inthe order, act in accordance with the provisions contained in Order XLV of the Code, so far as applicable"".It is to be noted here that although this rule does refer to the provisions of the Order XLV of the Civil ProcedureCode, these provisions are to be followed only so far as they are applicable. It is surely the duty of the High Courtto see that security is furnished or a deposit is made in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court andthese directions are to be found in the order of the Supreme Court which the Registrar is bound to transmit to theHigh Court under Order XIII, rule 8 of our Rules. We do not think it is necessary for the appellants to ﬁle afresh acopy of the Supreme Court order or the petition upon which it was made in order that they may form part of therecord of the Supreme Court appeal. They would come in the record as soon as they are transmitted by theRegistrar in accordance with the rule of our Court mentioned above and would have to be included in the PaperBook when it is printed. The Registrar of the High Court undoubtedly took these orders as part of the recordwithout the appellants' ﬁling them afresh, for he accepted the security and deposit of other moneys from theappellants on the basis of these orders. If there was any failure on the part of the appellants to furnish the securityor to make the deposit in the way indicated in the order of the Supreme Court, it would have been the duty of theRegistrar of the High Court to intimate these 251 facts to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and the latterthereupon could take steps for revoking the special leave as is contemplated by Order XIII, rule 12 of our Rules. Inour opinion, it is also not necessary for the appellants to make a formal application for admission of the appeal incases where special leave has been granted by the Supreme Court;-and this appears clear from the provision of Order XXXII, rule 9 of the Original Side Rules of the Calcutta HighCourt which runs as follows:"" 9. On the admission of an appeal to the Supreme Court whether by the order of this Court under Order XLV, rule 8of the Code, or by an order of the Supreme Court giving the appellant Special Leave to Appeal, but subject in thelatter case to the carrying out of the directions of the Supreme Court as to the security and the deposit of theamount re- quired by rule 5, notice of such admission shall be issued by the Registrar for service on the respondenton the record, whether be shall have appeared on the hearing of the application for a certiﬁcate under Order XLV,rule 3 of the Code, or not. Such notice shall be served by the attorney for the appellant and an aﬃdavit of dueservice thereof shall be ﬁled by such attorney immediately after such service"".The opening words of this rule plainly indicate that there could be admission of appeal either by order of the HighCourt under Order XLV, rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Code or by the order of the Supreme Court itself giving specialleave to appeal. (As the order granting special leave itself lays down the conditions to be fulﬁlled by the appellants,the admission will be regarded as ﬁnal only when the directions are complied with and as soon as this is done itwould be the duty of the Registrar to issue a notice of the admission of the appeal for service upon therespondents).This notice is to be served by the attorney for the appel- lants and an aﬃdavit of due service shall be ﬁled by himimmediately after the service is eﬀected..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/23.html/0209595695495www9545 9/12/2SHIVA JUTE BALING LTD.

This was not done as the procedure to be followed was not correctlyappreciated. It is true that the appellants remained idle for a considerable period of time even after they furnishedsecurity and did not take any steps towards printing of the record. But as there was an initial irregularity in thematter of issuing a notice under.Order XXXII, rule 9 of the Original Side Rules of the Calcutta High Court, we areunable to hold that the appellants were guilty of any laches for which the special leave deserves to be rescinded.The result is that the application of the respondents is dismissed. The Registrar, Original Side of the Calcutta HighCourt, will now issue a notice under Order XXXII, rule 9 of the Original Side Rules and prompt steps should betaken by the appellants towards printing and transmission of the record to this Court.

Sinha J.delivered a separate Judgment.DAS J.-This is a petition for a writ in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus calling upon the respondents to showcause why the petitioner, who is now conﬁned in the Central Jail at Rewa, should not be set at liberty. Thepetitioner' s grievance is that he has been deprived of his liberty otherwise than in accordance with procedureestablished by law. A rule nisi having been issued, the respondents have ﬁled an aﬃdavit by way of return to thewrit. The question for our decision is whether the return is good and suﬃcient in law.The facts leading up to the present petition are few and simple. In the years 1948 and 1949 the petitioner was theMinister of Industries in the Government of Vindhya Pradesh which was at that time an acceding State within themeaning of section 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935 as amended in 1947. On the 11th April, 1949 thepetitioner was arrested in Delhi on the allegation that he had accepted illegal gratiﬁcation in order to show favourto Panna Dia- mond Mining Syndicate in the matter of the lease of the Diamond Mines at Panna. In December,1949 the petitioner along with one Mohan Lal, who was the then secretary in the Ministry of Industries, was put upfor trial before the Court of Special Judge, Rewa, constituted under the Vindhya Pradesh Criminal LawAmendments (Special Courts) Ordinance No. V of 1949. The charges were under sections 120-B, 161 465 and 466of the Indian Penal Code as adapted for Vindhya Pradesh by the Indian Penal Code (Application to VindhyaPradesh) Ordinance No. XLVIII of 209 1949. By his judgment pronounced on the 26th July 1950 the Special Judgeacquitted both the accused. The State preferred an appeal against that acquittal to the Judicial Commissioner ofVindhya Pradesh. By his judgment pronounced on the 10th March 1951 the Judicial Commissioner reversed theorder of acquittal, convicted both the accused and sentenced them to diﬀerent terms of rigorous imprisonmentunder the diﬀerent sections in addition to the payment of certain ﬁnes. On the application of the petitioner and hisco-accused the Judicial Commissioner on the 12th March 1951 issued a certiﬁcate to the eﬀect that four points oflaw raised in the case and formulated by him in his order Were ﬁt for the consideration of this Court in appealunder article 134 of the Constitution of India. A petition of appeal was ﬁled in this Court on the strength of thiscertiﬁcate of ﬁtness and it was registered as Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 1951.As the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, it was, in April 1953,placed before a Bench of ﬁve Judges of this Court as required by article 145(3) of the Constitution. For convenienceof reference we shall call a Bench of ﬁve or more Judges as the Constitution Bench. The validity of the convictionsand sentences was challenged before the Constitution Bench on the ground that there had been infringements ofarticles 14 and 20 of the Constitution. A further point of law was raised that no appeal lay to the JudicialCommissioner from the acquittal by the special Judge. By their judgment pronounced on the 22nd May 1953 theConstitution Bench rejected all these objections. The judgment concluded with the following direction: "" Theappeal is accordingly directed to be posted for consideration whether it is to be heard on merits"". This wasevidently done in view of the fact that the certiﬁcate of ﬁtness granted by the Judicial Cormmissioner was limitedonly to four points of law.The constitutional points having been disposed of, the appeal was placed before a Division Bench of three Judgewho on the 20th October 1953 ordered 27 210 the appeal to be heard on the merits. The appeal was accordinglyput up for hearing before another Division Bench consisting of three Judges. On the 5th March 1954 this DivisionBench allowed the appeal of Mohan Lal and acquitted him but dismissed the appeal of the petitioner with respectto his conviction under sections 161, 465 and 466, Indian Penal Code, as adapted in Vindhya Pradesh, but set asidewww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 24.html/02095954959529 9/12/2RAO SHIV A BAHADUR SINGH V. THE ST A TE OF VINDHY A PRADESH & ANR [15] INSC 24; AIR 15 SC 46; 15 (2) SCR 2…his conviction on the charge under section 120-B. The sentence of three years' rigorous imprisonment wasmaintained but the sentence of ﬁne was set aside.On the 18th March 1954 a petition for review was ﬁled on behalf of the petitioner. It was directed against thejudgment of the Constitution Bench pronounced on the 22nd May 1953 repelling the constitutional points as wellas against the judgment of the Division Bench dated the 5th March 1954 dismissing the petitioner' s appeal on themerits.On objection being taken by the Registry against one application being ﬁled for the review of two judgments oneof which had been pronounced much earlier than the period allowed for ﬁling a review application, the petitionerﬁled a second application for review of the judgment of the Constitution Bench and prayed for condonation of thedelay in ﬁling the same. On the 5th April 1954 the application for review was put up for hearing before the sameDivision Bench which had pronounced the judgment on the merits dated the 5th March 1954. After consideringthe points of review relating to that judgment the Division Bench on the same day came to the conclusion that noground had been made out for review of that judgment and accordingly dismissed the petition. An order wasdrawn up as of that date directing the petitioner who had been previously enlarged on bail to surrender and serveout his sentence.On the 12th April 1954 another petition was ﬁled on behalf of the petitioner praying that the review matterrelating to the judgment of the Constitution Bench delivered on the 22nd May 1953 be placed before aConstitution Bench for ﬁnal disposal. That review application was put up before a Constitution 211 Bench which onthe 17th May 1954 declined to entertain the same.In the meantime the petitioner had in the last week of April 1954 surrendered and has since then been conﬁned inthe Central Jail at Rewa. The present application has, therefore, been made for a writ of habeas corpus on theallegation that the petitioner has been and is being deprived of his liberty otherwise than in accordance withprocedure established by law.In the present petition the petitioner has again urged that the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of VindhyaPradesh was not the proper forum for entertaining the appeal against the judgment of the Special Judge andconsequently the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner setting aside the acquittal of the petitioner convictingand imposing sentence of imprisonment was void and inoperative. Alternatively, it has been urged that, assumingthat the Judicial Commissioner had jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Special Judge and his judgment was inaccordance with procedure established by law, the appeal ﬁled by the petitioner in this Court against the judgmentof the Judicial Commissioner should have been, under article 145(3) of the Constitution, beard and completelydisposed of by the Constitution Bench.As regards the ﬁrst point as to the incompetency of the Court of the Judicial Commissioner to entertain the appealfrom the decision of the Special Judge the same has been fully dealt with by the Constitution Bench and cannot bereagitated. Indeed, learned counsel appearing in support of this petition has not pressed the same. The only pointurged before us is the alternative plea mentioned above which depends for its decision on a true construction ofarticle 145.Article 145 by clause (1) authorises this Court, subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament and withthe approval of the President to make rules for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court,including, amongst others, rules as to the procedure for hearing appeals, as to the entertainment of appeals undersub-clause (c) of clause (1) of article 212 134 and as to the conditions subject to which any judgment pronounced ororder made by the Court may be reviewed and the procedure for such review. Clauses (2) and (3) of the article arein the terms following-- "" (2)Subject to the provisions of clause (3), rules made under this article may ﬁx theminimum number of Judges who are to sit for any purpose, and may provide for the powers of single Judges andDivision Courts.(3)The minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantialquestion of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for the purpose of hearing any reference underarticle 143 shall be ﬁve:Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any of the provisions of this Chapter other than article 132consists of less than ﬁve Judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the Court is satisﬁed that the appealinvolves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which iswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 24.html/02095954959539 9/12/2RAO SHIV A BAHADUR SINGH V. THE ST A TE OF VINDHY A PRADESH & ANR [15] INSC 24; AIR 15 SC 46; 15 (2) SCR 2…necessary for the disposal of the appeal, such Court shall refer the question for opinion to a Court constituted asrequired by this clause for the purpose of deciding any case involving such a question and shall on receipt of theopinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion"".The contention of the petitioner is that the question whether a particular case involves a substantial question oflaw as to the interpretation of the Constitution is to be examined at the time when the case ﬁrst comes before thisCourt. If at that stage it is found that it is a case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation ofthe Constitution it becomes irrevocably impressed with that character and quality and the minimum number ofJudges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding such case must be a Constitution Bench, that is to say, a Bench ofat least ﬁve Judges. The argument then proceeds to say that once the Constitution Bench takes seisin of the caseand starts the hearing that 213 Bench and that Bench alone must decide the whole of such case, that is to say,decide all questions, constitutional or otherwise, arising in the case. Sri Purshottam Trikumdas who appears insupport of this petition has strongly relied on the language used in clause (3) and contends that ""the case"" cannotbe split up and that the clause requires the entire case to be disposed of by the Constitution Bench.He, therefore, urges that the Division Bench had no jurisdiction to take up the case involving substantial ques-tions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution and consequently the judgment of that Division Benchpronounced on the 5th March, 1954 was illegal and void.According to him, his client' s appeal, in the eye of the law, remains undisposed of and as he had been let out onbail until the disposal of his appeal, his detention in jail pursuant to the judgment of the Division Bench, which is anullity, amounts to deprivation of his personal liberty otherwise than in accordance with procedure established bylaw and is an infringement of his fundamental right under article 21 of the Constitution. The argument at ﬁrst sightcertainly appears to be plausible but on a deeper consideration of the constitutional provisions bearing on thesubject and the general principles regulating the procedural powers of Courts we are unable to accept the same assound or well-founded.In this very case the Judicial Commissioner of Vindhya Pradesh had granted a certiﬁcate of ﬁtness under article134(1)(c). Consequently under the proviso to clause (3) of article 145 the appeal might well have been placed beforea Division Bench consisting of less than ﬁve Judges. In that situation, being satisﬁed that the appeal involved asubstantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution the determination of which was necessaryfor the disposal of the appeal, that Division Bench could refer the question for the opinion of a Constitution Benchand on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion; but to accede to the argumentof Sri Purshottam Trikumdas will lead us to hold that while a Division Bench of three 214 Judges could split up thisvery case, had it been posted before it in the ﬁrst instance, by referring the con- stitutional questions to aConstitution Bench for its opinion and then, after receipt of that opinion, disposing of the rest of the case onmerits in conformity with such opinion, a Constitution Bench of ﬁve or more Judges before which the casehappened to be posted in the ﬁrst instance could not split up the case by deciding the constitutional questions andleaving the rest of the case to be dealt with and disposed of by a Division Bench of less than ﬁve Judges on meritsin conformity with the opinion of the Constitution Bench thus saving the time of the Constitution Bench.Reference may also be made to article 228 which authorises the High Court, if satisﬁed that a case pending in aCourt subordinate to it involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution thedetermination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, to withdraw the case and either to dispose of thecase itself or determine the said question of law and return the case to the Court from which it has been sowithdrawn so as to enable the said Court to proceed to dispose of the case in conformity with the judgment of theHigh Court. Here again learned counsel' s argument leads us to hold that while the High Court can split up a caseinvolving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution a Constitution Bench of thisCourt cannot do so. Apart from these provisions of the Constitution there are provisions made by proceduralstatutes which result in a case being partly heard by one Judge and partly by another Judge. To cite only a fewinstances, reference may be made to section 24 and Order 18, rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure and sections350, 526, 528 and 556 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The argument of Sri Purshottam Trikumdas, pushed toits logical conclusion, must amount to this that although Courts operating under the ordinary procedural code maysplit up cases into diﬀerent stages for the purpose of hearing and decision) a Constitution Bench of this Courtcannot do so if a case involving substantial questions of law as to 215 the interpretation of the Constitutionhappens to be posted before it in the ﬁrst instance.Learned counsel for the petitioner recognises the incongruity that results from his argument but contends that itcannot be helped because the relevant provisions referred to above expressly sanction the splitting up of caseswww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 24.html/02095954959549 9/12/2RAO SHIV A BAHADUR SINGH V. THE ST A TE OF VINDHY A PRADESH & ANR [15] INSC 24; AIR 15 SC 46; 15 (2) SCR 2…whereas the body of clause (3) of article 145 does not. His argument is that in the cases mentioned above splittingup of cases has to be allowed because the special provisions of the Constitution or other statutes provide for suchsplitting up in those cases. He contends that the very fact that these provisions had to be made clearly indicatesthat but for them there could not have been any splitting up of the case. It is said that these provisions areexceptions to the general rule of indivisibility of a case. We are unable to accept this reasoning as correct.In the ﬁrst place the proviso to article 145(3), article 228 and the other provisions of the Codes referred to abovequite clearly indicate that the splitting up of cases into diﬀerent stages for bearing and decision is not repugnant tothe Constitution or the general principles of procedural law. The underlying principle of the Constitution is clearand all that it insists upon is that all constitutional questions should be heard and decided by a Bench of not lessthan ﬁve Judges. As long as this requirement is fulﬁlled there can be no constitutional objection to the rest of thecase being disposed of by a Division Bench of less than ﬁve Judges, so as to save the time of the ConstitutionBench of ﬁve or more, Judges.In the next place we are not aware of any such general rule of indivisibility as is being insisted upon by learnedcounsel. There is nothing in principle which requires that a case,must always be decided in its entirety by oneJudge or one set of Judges even though such a case may conveniently be dealt with in two or more stages. Indeed,in Maulvi Muhammad Abdul Majid v. Muhammad Abdul Aziz(1) the Privy Council pointed out that where a Judgehad before (1) L.R. 24 I.A. 22.216 him a case consisting of two parts, a question of title and an incidental question of account depending on title,it did not require any provision of the Civil Procedure Code to authorise him to decide the ﬁrst question andreserve the second for further investigation and that to treat such a proceeding as beyond the power of the Courtand as an error which barred the proceedings reserved for further decision was a serious miscarriage of justice.Indeed, the Court often exercises its inherent power, if it thinks ﬁt to do so, to decide questions of jurisdiction orlimitation or the like as preliminary questions reserving other questions of fact for future investigation. Thedecision of a case at two or more stages may and often does result in the case not being decided by the sameJudge, for the Judge who decided at the ﬁrst stage may, by reason of death, retirement or transfer, be notavailable for deciding the case at the later stages, it follows, therefore, that no argument can be founded on anysupposed general rule of indivisibility of a case for the purpose of its hearing and decision.The consideration that there is no such general rule as is relied on by learned counsel and that the splitting up ofcases is not generally repugnant to law and in particular to the Constitution, leads us to the conclusion that inconstruing clause (3) of article 145 no quality of indivisibility need be attributed to the words ""the case"" usedtherein. A case may, to begin with, involve a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of theConstitution, but it may cease to do so at a later stage.Suppose a case which involves a constitutional question is placed before a Constitution Bench but learned counselappearing in support of the case intimates to the Bench that he does not press any constitutional point, surely hecan- not, in that situation, insist that the time of a Bench of ﬁve or more Judges should be spent on thedetermination of a case which, by his own election, has ceased to involve any constitutional question. Likewise,when the constitutional questions involved in the case are disposed of by a Constitution Bench what 217 remainsof the case cannot properly or appropriately be described as still a "" case involving a substantial question of law asto the interpretation of this Constitution"". It should be borne in mind that when a case or appeal is properlyadmitted to this Court all that the parties are entitled to is a decision of this Court and not of any Particular Bench.So long as the minimum number of Judges which the Constitution and the rules framed by this Court prescribe arepresent to hear and decide the questions raised from stage to stage, they represent the Court for the purpose ofgiving decisions on its behalf and the parties get all that they are entitled to under the law. If a Court is entitled todecide a case in stages, as the Privy Council has held it can, there is no reason why article 145(3) should be soconstrued as to deprive this Court of that inherent power. It will involve no violation of any principle of naturaljustice or of any legal principle if we construe clause (3) of article 145 as requiring only that the minimum numberof ﬁve Judges must sit for the purpose of deciding any case in so far and as long as it involves a substantialquestion of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution. We ﬁnd nothing in the language of clause (3) of article145 which militates against this interpretation of that clause. Indeed, it is on this interpretation that the practicehas grown up in this Court for a Constitution Bench to dispose of all constitutional questions and to leave the othersubsidiary questions for disposal by a Division Bench of less than ﬁve Judges in conformity with the opinion of theConstitution Bench. There is nothing that we ﬁnd in the body of clause (3) of article 145 which compels us todepart from the famous maxim cursus curiae est lex curiae which was laid down by Lord Coke in Burrowes v.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 24.html/02095954959559 9/12/2RAO SHIV A BAHADUR SINGH V.

Saidannessa Bibi(2).For reasons stated above we consider that a good and valid return has been made by the respondents to the rulenisi issued to them and this application must be dismissed. We order accordingly.(1) 3 Bulst. 48, 53.28 (2) I.L.R. 51 Cal. 331, 335.218 SINHA J.-I regret to have to diﬀer from my learned brethren on the construction of article 145(3) of theConstitution which is the main question in controversy in this case.Clause (3) of article 145 is in these terms:- "" The minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose ofdeciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for thepurpose of hearing any reference under article 143 shall be ﬁve:Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any of the provisions of this Chapter other than article 132consists of less than ﬁve Judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the Court is satisﬁed that the appealinvolves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which isnecessary for the disposal of the appeal, such Court shall refer the question for opinion to a Court constituted asrequired by this clause for the ' Purpose of deciding any case involving such a question and shall on receipt of theopinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion"".It is noteworthy that the Constitution has not vested this Court with complete power to make rules as to theconstitution of Benches for hearing matters coming before this Court in its Original, Appellate or AdviseryJurisdiction. Clause (2) of article 145 has invested this Court with power to make rules ﬁxing the minimum numberof Judges who are to sit for any purpose and for deﬁning the powers of single Judges and Division Courts. But thispower is expressly made subject to the limitation laid down in clause (3) quoted above; that is to say, where anycase involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution (omitting the words notmaterial for our present purpose) the minimum number of Judges prescribed by the Constitution to decide such acase is ﬁve. A case may involve questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, as also otherquestions.In this case we have to determine whether clause (3) contemplates the whole case or a part of a 219 case. In myopinion, the Constitution while laying down clause (3) of article 145 contemplates the whole matter in controversyarising in a case which may include substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution as alsoother questions. The main clause (3), excepting cases coming within the purview of the proviso does notcontemplate a splitting up of a case into parts, one part involving substantial questions of law as to theinterpretation of the Constitution and another part or parts not involving such questions. My reasons for coming tothis conclusion are as follows:Clause (3) itself read along with the proviso makes a distinction between a "" case"" and a "" question"" of the natureindicated in the proviso to the clause. The Constitution has clearly indicated that cases coming within the purviewof the proviso may be split up so as to admit of the questions of constitutional importance being determined by aBench of at least ﬁve Judges who may be described for the sake of convenience as "" Constitution Bench"" incontradistinction to a Division Court consisting of less than ﬁve Judges, as is contemplated in the proviso. Themain clause (3) requires a case of the description therein set out to be heard and decided by a Constitution Bench,whereas the proviso contemplates that only the question of constitutional importance (using a compendiousphrase) has to be decided by a Constitution Bench and the case out of which such a question arises remaining inthe seisin of the Division Court before which the case was originally placed for hearing.The Constitution has placed cases involving substantial questions of law of constitutional importance on a specialfooting. If the framers of the Constitution had intended that not the whole case but only particular questions ofthe nature indicated had to be heard by a minimum number of ﬁve Judges, they would have used words similar tothose used in the proviso making it permissible for the Constitution Bench to give its opinion for the decision ofthe case by a Division Court in conformity with that opinion, 220 A reference to the terms of article 228 of theConstitution would also show that the framers of the Constitution were fully alive to the diﬀerence between thedecision of the "" case itself "" and a "" question of law"" of constitutional importance involved in that case. It has madeclear in that article that the High Court shall either decide the whole case including the question of law as to theinterpretation of the Constitution which was necessary for the disposal of the case or determine only such awww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 24.html/02095954959569 9/12/2RAO SHIV A BAHADUR SINGH V. THE ST A TE OF VINDHY A PRADESH & ANR [15] INSC 24; AIR 15 SC 46; 15 (2) SCR 2…question or questions and return the case to the original court for disposal in conformity with the judgment of theHigh Court on such question or questions. The Constitution made these speciﬁc provisions to emphasize thatthere is a distinction between determining the case itself and determining a substantial question of law ofconstitutional importance.Can it be said that if clause (3) of article 145 had been enacted without the proviso, a case could be heardpiecemeal ﬁrst by a Constitution Bench which would determine only questions of law as to the interpretation ofthe Constitution, and then the residue of the case being heard and determined by a Division Court? That, in myopinion, would not be in compliance with the imperative provisions of the main clause (3). The framers of theConstitution therefore enacted the proviso in the nature of an exception to the general rule laid down in the mainclause (3). It has to be observed that the proviso is limited to appeals only, subject to the further exception thatsuch appeals should not have come up to this Court through the process laid down in article 132 of theConstitution. It is thus clear that not all cases contemplated in the main clause (3) but only appeals of a particulardescription would come within the qualifying provisions of the proviso.The word "" case"" has not been deﬁned but it may be taken as settled law that it is much wider than a "" suit"" or an"" appeal"". Hence whereas the proviso would apply to appeals brought up to this court, except those under article132 of the Constitution, the main clause (3) would apply to all appeals and all 221 other matters coming up to thisCourt in its Original, Appellate and Advisory jurisdictions. In my opinion, there cannot be the least doubt that themain provisions of clause (3) are all-embracing, and contemplate all cases coming up to this Court.It has not been contended that the present case comes within the purview of the proviso but it has been said that ifit is open to a Division Court to refer a question of constitutional importance to a Constitution Bench, why shouldnot a Constitution Bench be competent to refer questions other than those of constitutional importance to aDivision Court? The answer is that whereas the former is contemplated by the Constitution in terms, the latter isnot. Nor are there any rules to that eﬀect.But it has been further observed that the splitting up of a case into parts, one involving questions of constitutionalimportance and the remaining part not involving questions of that kind, is not against the provisions of theConstitution. But, in my opinion, if the Constitution has made a speciﬁc provision as to the splitting up of a caseinto parts, one cognisable by a Court of higher jurisdiction like a Constitution Bench and the rest by a court oflower jurisdiction like a Division Court, the argument is not available that a splitting up of a case apart from thosespeciﬁc provisions is also permissible. In this connection reference was made to certain provisions of the Code ofCivil Procedure as also of the Code of Criminal Procedure to show that those Codes do contemplate hearing of thesame case in part by diﬀerent courts, but those are all courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction in which the question ofthe power of the court itself relatively to the subject-matter of the case is not in question. The court whichoriginally dealt with the case and the court which ﬁnally came to hear and determine the matter were each one ofthem competent to deal with the whole matter or any part of it. That is not the position here. In this case theargument on behalf of the petitioner is that as admittedly his appeal involved substantial questions of law as to theinterpretation of the Constitution and as it did not come 222 within the purview of the proviso to clause (3) ofarticle 145 of the Constitution, it should have been dealt with throughout by a Constitution Bench. It wassuggested in answer to this argument that after the questions of law of constitutional importance had been dealtwith by the Constitution Bench the case ceased to be one involving such questions and therefore could have beenheard by a Division Court. But the diﬃculty in accepting this argument is that once a Constitution Bench wasseized of the case, it could not transfer it to another Bench for sharing the decision of that case with it. That Benchshould have heard out the whole case and it had not the power to direct, and it did not so direct, that theremaining part of the case should be heard by a Division Court. Once a Constitution Bench is seized of the case, ithas to hear the case to its conclusion. There was no process known to the rules framed under the rule-makingpower of this Court by which a case once it came before a Constitution Bench could get transferred from thatBench to a Division Court either automatically or by orders of any authority. But it has been suggested that it mayhappen that a Constitution Bench may start the hearing of the case, and before the hearing is concluded one ofthe Judges is by reason of death or otherwise disabled from hearing out the case and in that event the ChiefJustice has the power to constitute another Bench. But that is quite a diﬀerent matter. In that case the hearing bythe previous Bench comes to nothing and the Bench constituted afresh by the Chief Justice has to hear out thewhole case afresh.It has also been suggested on the other side that a "" case"" may mean a part of a case. In my opinion, thatsubmission is not well founded; because, if that argument were accepted and pushed to its logical conclusion, itmay make the provisions of the main clause (3) of article 145 nugatory.www.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 24.html/02095954959579 9/12/2RAO SHIV A BAHADUR SINGH V. THE ST A TE OF VINDHY A PRADESH & ANR [15] INSC 24; AIR 15 SC 46; 15 (2) SCR 2…Article 132 of the Constitution has been, as indicated above, excepted from the operation of the proviso to clause(3). Suppose an appeal is brought to this Court under article 132 of the Constitution as the case involved substantial223 questions of law as to the interpretation of the Con- stitution. That case besides involving questions of thatcharacter, may also involve other questions. If the argument that a "" case"" includes part of a case were accepted,then it will be permissible for a Constitution Bench to hear the questions of constitutional importance and leavethe rest of the case to be determined by a Division Court, though such a case is expressly excluded from theoperation of the proviso and thus is directly within the terms of the main clause (3). Hence every case comingbefore this Court involving a question of constitutional importance may be dealt with in part in so far as it relatesto that question by a Constitution Bench and the remaining part by a Division Court. That, in my opinion, was notintended by the framers of the Constitution. The term "" case"" therefore must mean the whole matter incontroversy before this Court. Such a matter may relate to one of several questions in controversy in the originalcourt, if the determination of that question is suﬃcient to dispose of the case within the meaning of theExplanation to article 132 of the Constitution.It was further argued by the learned Attorney-General that the whole clause (3) of article 145 along with theproviso must be read together. But even so read, the language of clause (3) does not warrant the hearing of thecase piecemeal by diﬀerent Benches unless it comes within the purview of the proviso. The proviso is meant tocover only a limited class of cases which otherwise would have come within the purview of the main clause (3). Butthe proviso cannot have a larger eﬀect than is justiﬁed by its language, viz., that only a question of that descriptionhas to be referred for the opinion of the larger Bench, the case itself remaining on the ﬁle of the smaller Bench.The proviso thus makes a clear distinction between a "" case"" and a "" question"".It has also been said there is an inherent power in the court to transact its business according to its establishedpractice. In the ﬁrst place, this Court is still in its formative stages and it cannot be said to 224 have an "" establishedpractice"". Secondly, it cannot establish a practice in the teeth of the provisions of the Constitution which it ispledged to uphold.The reference to the decision of the Privy Council in Moulvi Muhammad Abdul Majid v. Muhammad Abdul Aziz(1)is not apt because in that case the hearing at the two stages of the trial was to be done by a court of coordinatejurisdiction;that is to say, a court which could hear and determine the whole case or each of the two parts of the case takenseparately by itself, unlike the present case in which the two parts of the hearing have been done by two courts ofunequal power. Similarly the reference to the maxim "" cursus curiae est lex curiae"" of Coke C. J. in Burrowes v.High Commission Court(1), referred to in Habibar Rahman v.Saidannessa Bibi(3) and to the other cases all proceed on the assumption that there is nothing in the statute lawagainst such a course being taken. But, in my opinion, such a nebulous practice is opposed to the positiveprovisions of clause (3) of article 145.In my opinion therefore, the present case comes directly within the main clause (3) of article 145 of theConstitution and is admittedly not covered by the proviso to that clause. That being so, the petitioner' s appeal tothis Court has not been heard and determined in accordance with the procedure established by this Constitutionand therefore the petitioner is entitled to the beneﬁt of the protection aﬀorded by article 21 of the Constitution.His appeal, therefore, has got to be heard and determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in article145(3) of the Constitution. I would therefore allow the petition to this extent only that the appeal be heard by aConstitution Bench on a declaration that the judgment of the Division Court dated the 5th March 1954 is not thatof a competent court.-In accordance with the judgment of the majority, the petition is dismissed.(1) L.R. 21 I.A. 22.(2) 3 Bulst. 48, 53.(3) I.L.R. 51 Cal. 331, 335."

Once that position was established it was further urged that the jagirs in question were estateswithin the deﬁnition of the expression in article 31-A(2) (a) of the Constitution and the impugned legislation beinga legislation providing for the acquisition by the State of the estates and the rights therein or for theextinguishment or modiﬁcation of the same could not be challenged as void on the ground that it was inconsistentwith or abridged any of the rights conferred by any provisions of Part III of the Constitution, and that therefore theimpugned Act could not be challenged as violative of any of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners. It was alsourged that none of the provisions of the impugned Act were conﬁscatory or in any manner whateverdiscriminatory, fair and adequate compensation having been provided for the abolition of the jagirs and the Statesand their subjects not having been dealt within any discriminatory manner as compared with the subjects of theoriginal State of Bombay.As regards the contention that the agreements of merger and the letters of guarantee were executed by theDominion of India and were not binding on the State of Bombay it was urged on behalf of the Petitioners that theGovernment of the Dominion of India was certainly bound by those guarantees and this obligation of theDominion Government devolved upon the Province of Bombay when the erstwhile States which were parties tothe agreements of merger 174 and the letters of guarantee became merged in the Province of Bombay, underclause 8 of the States' Merger (Governors' Provinces) Order, 1949 (Appendix XLIV, White Paper, Page 297), thatthese obligations were thus deemed to have been undertaken by the Dominion Government on behalf of theabsorbing Province, viz., the Province of Bombay and were binding upon the Province of Bombay, and that whenthe Constitution came into force from the 26th January 1950 all rights, liabilities and obligations of theGovernment of each Governors' Province whether arising out of any contract or otherwise were under article 294of the Constitution to be the rights, liabilities and obligations respectively of the Government of eachcorresponding State and these obligations of the Province of Bombay accordingly became the obligations of theState of Bombay. It was further urged that the State of Bombay was thus bound by all the obli- gations which badbeen undertaken by the Dominion Government under the agreements of merger and letters of guarantee abovereferred to, and it could not lie in the mouth of the State of Bombay to repudiate the same.This argument is not without force, but we do not consider it necessary to decide this question because evenassuming that the State of Bombay was bound by these obligations, the question still remains how far thePetitioners before us are entitled to enforce these obligations against the State of Bombay. The Petitioners werecertainly not parties to these agreements of merger and letters of guarantee eo nominee.They could only claim to be parties to the same by reason of the fact that the Rulers of the erstwhile States did notnegotiate these agreements of merger or obtain the letters of guarantee only in respect of their personal rightsand properties but also represented the States and their subjects in the matter of obtaining the same and thesubject of these States were therefore represented by the Rulers and were entitled to the beneﬁt of whateverobligations were undertaken by the Dominion of India qua the States and their subjects. It is therefore arguablethat the Rulers 175 of the erstwhile States as also their subjects would be in a position to enforce these obligations.This position was however sought to be negatived by relying upon the following observation of their Lordships ofthe Privy Council in Vajesingji Joravarsingji v. Secretary of State for India in Council(1) at page 360:- ""But asummary of the matter is this: when a territory is acquired by a sovereign state for the ﬁrst time that is an act ofstate. It matters not how the acquisition has been brought about. It may be by conquest, it may be by cessionfollowing on treaty, it may be by occupation of territory hitherto unoccupied by a recognized ruler. In all cases theresult is the same. Any inhabitant of the territory can make good in the municipal Courts established by the newsovereign only such rights as that sovereign has, through his oﬃcers, recognised. Such rights as he had under therule of predecessors avail him nothing.

TE SAE OF BOMBAY & OS [] IC 25; AIR 15 SC 50; 15 (2) SR 14 (6 Apr…inhabitants should enjoy certain rights, that does not give a title to those inhabitants to enforce these stipulationsin the municipal Courts. The right to enforce remains only with the high contracting parties"".These observations were quoted with approval in Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustsam Khan & Others(2) at page124. It was therefore urged that it will be the high contracting parties, viz., the Rulers of the respective States whowould be in a position to enforce these obligations and not the Petitioners for whose beneﬁt these obligationswere undertaken by the Dominion Government.We do not feel called upon to pronounce upon the validity or otherwise of these contentions also for the simplereason that the Petitioners would be out of Court either way. If they were deemed to be parties to the agreementsof merger and letters of guarantee they would be faced with the bar to the maintainability of the petitions underarticle 363 of the Constitution which lays down that neither the Supreme (1) 51 Indian Appeals 357.(2) 68 Indian Appeals 109.176 Court nor any other Court shall have jurisdiction in any dispute arising out of any provision of a treaty,agreement, covenant, engagement, sanad or other similar instrument which was entered into or executed beforethe commencement of the Constitution by any 'Ruler of an Indian State and to which the Government of theDominion of India.................... was a party. If on the other hand they were deemed not to have been parties to thesame they would not be the contracting parties and would certainly not be able to enforce these obligations.It was therefore urged on behalf of the Petitioners that the dispute between the parties did not arise out of theprovisions of the agreements of merger and the letters of guarantee which were entered into or executed by theRulers of the respective States and to which the Government of the Dominion of India was a party. According tothe Petitioners they merely challenged the vires of the impugned Act and relied upon clause 5 of the letters ofguarantee in order to establish the position that the State Legislature had no legislative competence to legislateon the subject of the abolition of jagirs. That was, it was submitted, not a dispute arising out of the agreements ofmerger and letters of guarantee but arose out of the act of the State Legislature in enacting the impugned Act indirect contravention of the guarantee incorporated in clause 5 of the letters of guarantee. This argument howeverwould not avail the Petitioners, because if one looked into the averments contained in their petitions it was clearthat the whole ambit of the petitions was to enforce clause 5 of the letters of guarantee. The Petitioners reliedupon clause 5 of the letters of guarantee which had been obtained by the Rulers of the erstwhile State from theDominion Government and complained that the State Legislature had enacted the impugned Act which it had nopower to enact having regard to clause 5 of the said letters of guarantee and were wrongfully depriving thePetitioners of the jagirs, the ownership of which had been guaranteed thereunder. The whole of the petitions werenothing else except the 177 claim to enforce the Petitioners' rights under the letters of guarantee, and the disputestherefore were clearly in respect of the agreements of merger and the letters of guarantee and were covered byarticle 363 (1) of the Constitution. A similar contention had been raised on behalf of the plaintiﬀs in State ofSeraikella and Others v. Union of India and Another(1) and was repelled by Kania, C.J. at page 490 as under:---""The plaintiﬀ contends ﬁrstly that it had signed the Instrument of Accession through its Ruler. The State nextcomplains that, acting beyond the powers given over under the Instrument of Accession,.the Dominion of Indiaand the State of Bihar are trespassing wrongfully on its legislative and executive functions, that the Dominion ofIndia and the State of Bihar are making laws which they have no power to make, having regard to the Instrumentof Accession, and are wrongfully interfering with the administration of the State beyond the rights given to themunder the Instrument of Accession. The whole plaint is nothing else except the claim to enforce the plaintiﬀ 's rightunder the Instrument of Accession. The dispute therefore in my opinion clearly is in respect of this Instrument ofAccession and is covered by Article 363(1) of the Constitution of India. The question of the validity of the diﬀerentenactments and orders is also based on the rights claimed under the Instru- ment of Accession so far as theplaintiﬀ is concerned"".It could not therefore be urged that what the Petitioners were doing was not to enforce the obligations undertakenby the Dominion Government under the agreements of merger and the letters of guarantee, or that the disputesbetween the parties did not arise out of the provisions of the agreements of merger and the letters of guaranteewhich were entered into or executed by the Rulers of the respective States and to which the Government ofDominion of India was a party within the meaning of Article 363 of the Constitution.(1) [ 1951] INSC 23; 1951 S.C.R. 474..liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/IC/15/25.h/020MELNRHTTR1955NS95495C6ilwwwiiaseNS95tml69 9/12/2MAHARAJ UG SG & OS V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY & OS [] IC 25; AIR 15 SC 50; 15 (2) SR 14 (6 Apr…23 178 If that was the position the jurisdiction of this Court was ousted and this Court could not interfere in thosedisputes.Assuming however that the Petitioners were entitled to enforce the obligation and guarantee incorporated inclause 5 of the letters of s guarantee the further diﬃculty in the way of the Petitioners is that the State Legislaturewas fully competent to enact the impugned Act notwithstanding the terms of the guarantee. The legislativecompetence of the State Legislature can only be circumscribed by express prohibition contained in theConstitution itself and unless and until there is any provision in the Constitution expressly prohibiting legislationon the subject either absolutely or conditionally, there is no fetter or limitation on the plenary powers which theState Legislature enjoys to legislate on the topics enumerated in the Lists II & III of the Seventh Schedule to theConstitution. It was conceded on behalf of the Petitioners that the topic of legislation which was covered by theimpugned Act was well within List II of the said Schedule and the vires of the impugned Act could not bechallenged on that ground. The ground of attack was that the Dominion Government and therefore the StateGovernment bad waived its right to legislate on the topic of the abolition of jagirs or had in any event put a fetteror limitation on their power to issue any legislation in that behalf by the terms of the guarantee contained in clause5 of the letters of guarantee. It was contended that under the terms of clause 5 an absolute guarantee had beengiven by the Dominion Government in regard to the enjoyment of the ownership of jagirs and that the DominionGovernment and therefore the State of Bombay were precluded from enacting any legislation which had theeﬀect of destroying that ownership. This contention however could not be supported by the terms of clause 5which embodied in the ﬁrst part thereof the terms of the guarantee, and went on to provide in the second partthat this guarantee was without prejudice to the right of the Government of Bombay to issue any legislation whichdid not discriminate against the States and their 179 subjects. It was therefore not an absolute guarantee but wascircumscribed or cut down by the reservation of the power to make law with respect to jagirs provided such lawdid not discriminate against the States and their subjects.The right of the Government of Bombay which was thus reserved covered the whole of the guarantee embodied inthe ﬁrst part of the clause and there was nothing in these terms which would go to show that the ownership of thejagirs could not be touched and the legislation, if any, was to be enacted in regard to certain incidents ofenjoyment of such ownership. The right of the Government of Bombay to issue any legislation with regard to theenjoyment of the ownership of jagir lands was expressly reserved and this right covered also legislation in regardto the abolition of the jagirs and the Government of Bombay was therefore entitled under the terms of this clause5 to issue any legislation in regard to the same provided however that such legislation did not discriminate againstthe States and their subjects. That was the only fetter or limitation, imposed upon the right of the Government ofBombay to issue any legislation in regard to the enjoyment of the ownership of jagir lands and if that fetter orlimitation could also be imposed on the State Legislature the Petitioners would have had a right to challenge theimpugned Act on the ground that it discriminated against the States and their subjects.The fetter or limitation upon the legislative power of the State Legislature which had plenary powers of legislationwithin the ambit of the legislative heads speciﬁed in the Lists II & III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitutioncould only be imposed by the Constitution itself and not by any obligation which bad been undertaken by eitherthe Dominion Government or the Province of Bombay or even the State of Bombay. Under Article 246 the StateLegislature was invested with the power to legislate on the topics enumerated in Lists II & III of the SeventhSchedule to the Constitution and this power was by virtue of article 245(1) subject to the provisions of theConstitution. The Constitution itself laid down the fetters 180 or limitations on this power, e.g., in article 303 orarticle 286(2). But unless and until the Court came to the conclusion that the Constitution itself had expresslyprohibited legislation on the subject either absolutely or conditionally the power of the State Legislature to enactlegislation within its legislative competence was plenary.Once the topic of legislation was comprised within any of the entries in the Lists II & III of the Seventh Schedule tothe Constitution the fetter or limitation on such legislative power had to be found within the Constitution itself andif there was no such fetter or limitation to be found there the State Legislature had full competence to enact theimpugned Act no matter whether such enactment was contrary to the guarantee given, or the obligationundertaken by the Dominion Government or the Province of Bombay or even the State of Bombay. ThePetitioners would have a legitimate grievance in the matter of the deprivation of their rights of ownership of thejagir lands in so far as the States and their subjects were discriminated against, but they would not be able to havetheir grievance redressed by this Court for the simple reason that the State Legisla- ture was at all eventscompetent to enact the impugned Act not being fettered at all by the terms of clause 5 of the letters of guarantee.The provisions of article 294(b) of the Constitution which is said to have transferred the obligations of the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/IC/15/25.h/020MELNRHTTR1955NS95495C6ilwwwiiaseNS95tml79 9/12/2MAHARAJ UG SG & OS V.

The remedy of the Petitioners would beelse- where and not in this forum. The learned Judges of the Federal Court gave an answer to a similar complaintof the Taluqdars of Oudh made by them against the United Provinces Tenancy Act XVII of 1939 in Thakur 181Jagannath Baksh Singh v. The United Provinces(1) at page 87:- ""We desire, however, to point out that what theyare now claiming is that no Legislature in India has any right to alter the arrangements embodied in their sanadsnearly a century ago; and, for all we know, they would deny the right of Parliament itself to do so. We hope that noresponsible Legislature or Government would ever treat as of no account solemn pledges given by theirpredecessors; but the readjustment of rights and duties is an inevitable process, and one of the functions of theLegislature in a modern State is to eﬀect that readjustment, where circumstances have made it necessary, withjustice to all concerned. It is however, not for this 'Court to pronounce upon the wisdom or the justice, in thebroader sense, of legislative acts;it can only say whether they were validly enacted........................................"" These observations were quoted withapproval by Their Lordships of the Privy Council in Thakur Jagannath Baksh Singh v. The United Provinces(1) atpage 122 and we also would observe in the same strain that we are not concerned with the policy of the StateLegislature in enacting the impugned Act for abolition of jagirs but we are only concerned with the questionwhether the impugned Act was validly enacted.No argument has been advanced before us which would enable us to hold that the impugned Act was ultra viresthe State Legislature, the only ground of attack being that it was in contravention of the guarantee given in clause5 of the letters of guarantee. But that position is of no avail to the Petitioners.Considerable argument was addressed before us based on the comparison of the provisions of the various Acts ofthe Bombay State Legislature enacted during the years 1949 to 1953 in regard to the abolition of the varioustenures obtaining within the State of Bombay with the provisions of the impugned Act, with a view to show thatthe provisions of the impugned Act were discriminatory against the States (1) 1943 F.C.R. 72.(2) 1946 F.C.R. III.182 and their subjects within the meaning of clause 5 of the letters of guarantee. We have not thought it necessaryto refer to the same in view of the conclusion which we have reached above that the impugned Act was intra viresthe powers of the State Legislature and the State Legislature was quite competent to enact the same.Even if it could be demonstrated that the provisions of the impugned Act were conﬁscatory as well asdiscriminatory in the manner suggested, the jagirs of the Petitioners (except in the case of the Petitioner inPetition No. 364 of 1954) were all estates within the meaning of the term as deﬁned in Article 31-A(2)(a) of theConstitution and even if the impugned Act provided for the acquisition of the estates or of any rights therein or forthe extinguishment or modiﬁca- tion of any such rights the impugned Act could not be challenged as void on theground that it was inconsistent with or took away or abridged any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part 11Iof the Constitution. Any challenge therefore on the ground of the impugned Act violating the fundamental rightsof the Petitioners under article 14 or article 19(1)(f) or article 31(2) of the Constitution was not available to thePetitioners. On the other hand if the grievance was that the impugned Act had brought about dis- crimination inbreach of clause 5 of the letters of gua- rantee then the dispute clearly arose out of the letters of guarantee andwould by article 363 be placed beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. The Petitions of the Petitioners except PetitionNo. 364 of 1954 which would be dealt with immediately hereafter therefore fail and are liable to be dismissed.Petition No. 364 of 1954 In addition to the grounds common to all the Petitions which we have already dealt withabove the Petitioner in Petition No. 364 of 1954 claims that he is the owner of the 60 villages in the Putta orterritory of Moti Moree comprised in the erstwhile State of Idar as the Bhumia or underlord and contends that hisholding does not fall within the deﬁnition of 183 jagir as given in the impugned Act. In support of his contention hehas traced the history of Moti Moree since 1250 A.D. and in any event since 1800 A.D when the then Chieftain ofMoti Moree entered into a treaty with the Maharaja Zalimsinh of Modasa whereby in consideration of payment ofRs. 361 annually the said Zalimsinh agreed to protect Moti Moree against the attacks of the neighboring State ofDoongarpur. He has pointed out that thereafter Modasa was absorbed into the Taluka of Amnagar in 1821 andsubsequently in about 1849 it reverted to Idar State and continued with the Idar State until the latter merged intothe Province of Bombay in 1948. He contends that he and his predecessors were enjoying and exercising full.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/IC/15/25.h/020MELNRHTTR1955NS95495C6ilwwwiiaseNS95tml89 9/12/2MAHARAJ UG SG & OS V. TE SAE OF BOMBAY & OS [] IC 25; AIR 15 SC 50; 15 (2) SR 14 (6 Apr…sovereign rights over Moti Moree ever since the said treaty of 1800 and their position had remained unchanged,their only liability being to pay Rs. 361 annually for protection. He further contends that they were enjoying therights of excise and customs and revenue, that they did not pay any revenue to the State of Idar and enjoyed andcontinued to enjoy rights over all lands, forests, minerals, river beds, village sites, etc. and that when the Ruler ofIdar wanted that there should be uniform customs levy throughout the State, the said Ruler had to givecompensation to the Petitioner and had also similarly negotiated with them and had to pay compensation to themin respect of salt, opium, excise etc. He has pointed out that Rs. 457 for customs' Rs. 40 for opium and Rs. 7 for saltwere being paid annually by the erstwhile State of Idar and thereafter by the Government of State of Bombay tohim by way of compensation for these sovereign rights of his, which amounts were set oﬀ against Rs. 361 beingthe annual payment of protection which he paid as aforesaid to them. These rights of his recognised by theerstwhile State of Idar and also by the State of Bombay constituted him a Thakur or underlord of Moti Moree andhe contends that his estate of Moti Moree is not a jagir within the deﬁnition of the term given in the impugned Act.Our attention has also been drawn in this behalf to 184 Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. 5 (1880), page 398, where Mori(Meghraj) is described as the estate of the original landlords Bhumias otherwise described as petty chiefs andunderlords and to page 409 where the underlords (Bhumias) are stated to be the early chiefs who settled in Idar atleast not later than the Rathod conquest (about 1250).The State of Bombay on the other hand has denied the several allegations contained in the petition and contendsthat in the year 1891 the erstwhile State of Idar had conferred upon the Thakore of Moti Moree the powers of aThird Class Magistrate as an act of ""grace"", that in 1902 the management of the estate was taken over by theerstwhile State of Idar and one Kamdar Mathurlaji was appointed as Japtidar, that in 1910 the management waslifted as a special case and the arrears of Nazrana were ordered to be recovered in installments by the erstwhileState of Idar that in several documents Moti Moree was described as Bhomia Jagir within the deﬁnition of the termJagir as given in the impugned Act and that the sum of Rs. 361 was still being regularly paid even after merger as""Kichari hak"". It therefore contends that the Thakore of Moti Moree, the Petitioner is a jagirdar and Moti Moree is ajagir within the meaning of the deﬁnition thereof given in the impugned Act.These allegations and counter-allegations do not however carry the matter any further. In order to exclude MotiMoree and the Petitioner from the operation of the impugned Act it will be necessary for the Petitioner to establishsatisfactorily that Moti Moree is, not a jagir within the deﬁnition thereof given in the impugned Act. Even thoughthe allegations of the Petitioner go far enough to make it probable that Moti Moree was neither held by thePetitioner and his ancestors under a grant or was not recognised as a grant by the Ruler of the erstwhile State ofIdar, that would not be enough to enable us to grant him the relief prayed for by him. The question requires to becompletely thrashed out and adjudicated upon by a Court of law after going into the evidence 185 adduced beforeit by both the parties. The learned Attorney-General appearing for the State of Bombay has therefore submittedthat this question should be enquired into by a proper tribunal and the Petitioner should be referred to a civil suit inorder to establish his rights.We accordingly feel that the Petition No. 364 of 1954 should be adjourned till after the disposal of a civil suit to beﬁled by the Petitioner in the proper Court for a declaration that Moti Moree is not a jagir within the deﬁnition ofthe term as given in the impugned Act and for consequential reliefs. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner hasgiven us to understand that a formal notice under Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code in this behalf has alreadybeen served by the Petitioner on the State of Bombay. We therefore order that the Petitioner do ﬁle the necessarysuit within 3 months from this date and this petition do stand adjourned till after the hearing and ﬁnal disposal ofthat suit. The stay granted by this Court in this petition will continue in the meanwhile. We may record here thatthe learned Attorney-General on behalf of the State of Bombay has also given his undertaking not to take anysteps against the Petitioner in the meanwhile.Petitions Nos. 337 to 349, 365, 366, 481 and 690 of 1954 will therefore stand dismissed. Petition No. 364 of 1954 willstand adjourned sine die till after the disposal of the civil suit to be ﬁled by the Petitioner as above indicated.If no such suit is ﬁled within the aforesaid period this petition will also stand dismissed.

RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)the temple of Aranya Devi and Killa Ki Devi. The appellant before us-a woman-brought this suit claiming joint titleto the oﬃce along with the defendant and as such entitled to perform the Puja either by herself or through herKarinda and to get a half share in the income of oﬀerings of the said Asthan.It is the admitted case that this oﬃce belongs to the family of both the parties and that the duties of the oﬃcewere being jointly performed by the defendant and his deceased brother, Rambeyas Pande, and that they wereenjoy- ing the emoluments jointly. The plaintiﬀ-the widow of Rambeyas Pande-claims to have succeeded to herhusband's share in this property and bases her suit on- the said claim. In the written statement the defendantraised three main defences, two out of which are (1) the plaintiﬀ was not the legally wedded wife of his brother,Rambeyas Pande, and (2) during the life time of Rambeyas Pande, there was a division between them withreference to the oﬃce of Pujari and Panda belonging to this family in respect of two temples (a) at Arrah and (b) atGangipul, that the oﬃce of pujari at Gangipul was given to the plaintiﬀ 's husband and that the temple of Aran Deviat Arrah was given to the defendant and that since then, i.e., for about 11 years prior to the date of the suit, theplaintiﬀ 's husband had no connection with the oﬃce of Pujari in this temple nor with the receipt of any oﬀeringstherein. Both these contentions were found against the defendant by the trial court as well as by the ﬁrst appellatecourt and they have become conclusive. The further and third defence raised by the defendant was that theproperty in suit, viz., the oﬃce of Pujari and Panda of the templet cannot be-inherited by a female, The contention188 is set out in the following terms in the written statement:""The plaintiﬀ is not at all entitled to the oﬃce and the post of Pujari and Panda of Arun Devi and she is not entitledto get 1/2 share or any share in the income and oﬀering of the said Asthan, nor has she got any right to performPuja as a Panda personally, or through her karinda and to get the income, etc. This is against the custom andusage and practice and also against the Sastras. The property in suit is such as cannot be inherited by a female"".It is the question thus raised which has got to be con- sidered in this appeal.The trial Court held against this contention in the following terms:""No authority has been cited nor any custom proved to show that, female cannot inherit a property of this nature"".The ﬁrst appellate Court also aﬃrmed this view as follows:""The defendant's objection that the plaintiﬀ being a female is not authorised to hold the oﬃce of a priest of theAranya Debi temple is not borne out by any evidence or material on the record. There is nothing to show that byreason of her sex she is debarred from holding this oﬃce either by religion, custom or usage. Moreover admittedlyshe holds the oﬃce at the Gangi temple"".On the ﬁndings arrived at by the trial court and the ﬁrst appellate court, the plaintiﬀ got a decree as prayed, fordeclaring her right to half share in the oﬃce and for recovery of mesne proﬁts on that footing. On second appealto the High Court, the learned Judges went into the question at some length and were of the opinion that ""theplaintiﬀ being a female is not entitled to inherit the priestly oﬃce in question and her claim to oﬃciate as a priestin the temple by rotation cannot be sustained. The declaration sought for by her that she is entitled to the oﬃce ofPujari cannot, therefore, be granted"". They held, however, ""that she is not debar-red from being entitled to bemaintained out of the estate of her, husband which, in 189 the particular case, happens to be no other than theemoluments attached to the priestly oﬃce in the shape of oﬀerings made to the deity which oﬃce wasundoubtedly hereditary"". They further held that ""she will be entitled to receive from the defendant half theamount of the oﬀerings in lieu of her maintenance"" and they varied the decree of the trial court accordingly. Theshort question that arises, therefore, for consideration in this appeal is whether a Hindu female is entitled tosucceed to the hereditary priestly oﬃce of a Pujari and Panda held by her husband in a temple and to receive theemoluments thereof.This is a question about which there has been some diﬀ- erence of opinion in the decided cases. It requires closeexamination.That religious oﬃces can be hereditary and that the right to such an oﬃce is in the nature of property under theHindu Law is now well established. A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Manohar v. Bhupendra(1) has laidthis down in respect of Shebaitship of a temple and this view has been accepted by the Privy Council in twosubsequent cases in Ganesh v. Lal Behary(2) and Bhabatarini v. Ashalata (3)..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9562 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)In a recent judgment of this Court reported as The Com- missioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. SriLakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar(4) this view has been reiterated and extended to the oﬃce of a Mahant. On theview that Shebaiti is property, this Court has also recognised the right of a female to succeed to the religious oﬃceof Shebaitship in the case reported as Angurbala v.Debabrata(5), where the question as to the applicability of Hindu Women's Right to Property Act to the oﬃce ofShebaitship came up for consideration. On the same analogy as that of a Shebaiti right, the right of a hereditarypriest or Pujari in a temple must also amount to property where emoluments are attached to such an oﬃce.Indeed, some of the decisions which have recognised the Shebaiti right as property appear to be cases where theShebaiti (1) A.I.R. 1932 Calcutta 791.(2) (1936] L.R. 68 I.A. 448.(3) [ 1943] L.R. 70 I.A. 57.(4) [ 1954] INSC 46; [ 1954] S.C.R. 1005.(5) [ 1951] S.C.R. 1125.190 right combines the priestly oﬃce of a Pujari of the idol with the oﬃce of the manager of the temple, who inSouth India, is known by the name of Dharmakarta. As early as in Mitta Kunth Audhicarry v. NeerunjunAudhicarry(1), it was recognised that hereditary priestly oﬃce in a family is property liable to partition. A numberof other decisions to be noticed in the later part of this judgment recognise this position. The learned Judges of theHigh Court in their judgment in the case under appeal, have attempted to distinguish the present case from that ofthe case of the Shebaitship and have come to the conclusion that while in respect of Shebaiti right a woman maysucceed by heirship, she is not entitled to such succession in respect of the right of a Panda and Pujari. But inmaking this distinction they do not negative the idea that the right to the oﬃce of the Pujari itself is property towhich a female could succeed, but for her supposed disqualiﬁcation. The disqualiﬁcation is said to arise withreference to the duties attached to this oﬃce, and it is said that in this respect it diﬀers from the oﬃce of aShebait.Now there can be no doubt that while in one sense the right to such a religious oﬃce is property it involves alsosubstantial elements of duty. As has been stated by this Court in Angurbala v. Debabrata(2) and in TheCommissioner, H. R. E., Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar(3) ""both the elements of oﬃce and property,of duties and personal interest are blended together (in such oﬃces) and neither can be detached from the other"".It must also be recognised that in respect of such oﬃces especially where they are attached to public institutions,the duties are to be regarded as primary and that the rights and emoluments are only appurtenant to the duties.See the -observations of Justice Page in Nagendra v. Rabindra(4) at pages 495 and 496 and that of Justice SadasivaAiyar in Sundarambal v.Yogavanagurukkal(5) at page 564, as also of Mukherjea on 'Endowments (1) [ 1875] XIV B.L.R. 166.(2) (1951] S.C.R. 1125.(3) [ 1954] INSC 46; [ 1954] S.C.R. 1005.(4) A.I.R. 1926 Calcutta.490.(5) A.I.R. 1915 Madras 561.191 (1952 Edn.) page 201. If, therefore, it is found that the recognition of a female's right to succeed to thehereditary oﬃce of Pujari in a temple held by her husband is incompatible with due discharge of the duties of theoﬃce, her right to succeed must be negatived. The correct approach to a question of this kind has been laid downby the Privy Council in a case which relates to a Mohammadan religious oﬃce but would equally be applicable to aHindu religious oﬃce. In Shahar Bano v. Aga Mahomed Jaﬀer Bindaneem(1) their Lordships, after noticing theView taken by the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court, that ""there is no legal prohibition against a womanholding a mutwalliship when the trust, by its nature involves no spiritual duties such as a woman could notproperly discharge in person or by deputy"" approved this view of the High Court and said ""it appears to theirLordships that there is ample authority for that proposition"". The question, therefore, that requires considerationin the present case is whether the oﬃce of the Pujari and Panda in a temple involves such duties as could not be.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9563 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)discharged by a female in person and if so, whether she is also incompetent to get the same discharged by adeputy.Now for this purpose it is desirable to have a clear idea of the duties of a Pujari in an ordinary Hindu temple. APujari has to perform the prescribed daily worship of the image as well as the special worship of a periodical natureon particular occasions and for prescribed festivals during the year. In Ramabrahma Chatterjee V. Kedar NathBanerjee Justice Sir Asutosh Mookerjee indicated the daily routine of worship in the following passage:""The normal type of continued worship of a consecrated image consists of the sweeping of a temple, the processof smearing, the removal of the previous day's oﬀerings of ﬂowers, the presentation of fresh ﬂowers and water,and other like practices. It is suﬃcient to state that the deity is, in short, conceived as a living being and is treatedin the same way as the (1) [ 1906] L.R. 84 I.A. 46, 53.(2) A.I.R. 1923 Calcutta 60, 62.192 master of the house would be treated by his humble servant.The daily routine of life is gone through with minute accuracy; the viviﬁed image is regaled with the necessariesand luxuries of life in due succession, even to the changing of clothes, the oﬀering of cooked and uncooked food,and the retirement to rest"".In Saraswati's Hindu Law of Endowments(1) the nature of the daily worship of a consecrated idol in a temple is setout at pages 134 and 135 in detail. It must be recognised that the daily worship diﬀers according to the tenets andusages of the religious sect for which the temple is intended and the idol is consecrated. But whatever may be thedetails of the worship and the variations therein, there can be no doubt that the ministration of various servicesinvolving personal touch of the idol, and, often enough, the recitation of religious hymns inclusive of Vedic hymnsare amongst the normal and essential features of a Pujari's duties, at any rate in temples where the worship isconducted according to the Shastras. It is also undisputed that according to Hindu Shastras the functions of aPujari can be performed only by certain limited classes and involves special qualiﬁcations and that these classesmay vary with the nature of the institution. Now, whatever may have been the position in early times, of whichthere is no clear historical evidence, it appears to have been well established in later times that a female, even ofthe recognised limited classes, cannot by herself perform the duties of a Pujari. Even at a time when the institutionof temple worship had probably not come into general vogue, the incapacity of a woman to recite Vedic texts, tooﬀer sacriﬁcial ﬁre, or to perform sacramental rites, is indicated in certain texts of Manu. (See Sacred Books of theEast, Manu, Vol. 25, pages 330 and 437, Chapter 9, section 18 and Chapter 11, section 36). Whether it is on the basisof these texts or for some other reason, her incapacity to discharge, in person, the duties of the Pujari appears tohave been well (1) The Hindu Law of Endowments by Pandit Prannath Saraswati, T.L.L., 1892. (1897 Edn.).193 settled in later times as appears from the following text from Brihan-Naradiya Purana quoted in Saraswati'sHindu Law of Endowments at page 136.""Women, those uninvested with the sacred thread, (i.e. the members of the Dvija class before the initiationceremony has been performed for them), and Sudras are not competent to touch images of Vishnu or Siva. ASudra, one uninvested with the sacred thread, a woman or an outcaste, having touched -Vishnu or Siva, goes tohell"".This passage, in terms, refers to the images of Vishnu and Siva but it may reasonably be assumed, in the absenceof any evidence to the contrary, that in practice the incapacity of a female to discharge the duties of a Pujari byherself extended, at any rate, to all public temples where an image of whatever form had been consecrated andinstalled according to the Shastras. Indeed, all the cases on the subject have assumed this incapacity of thefemale. The point of controversy has been whether she is also incompetent to get the duties discharged byemploying a qualiﬁed substitute. If her competence in this behalf is recognised and can be accepted there is noreason why she should not be held entitled to succeed to the oﬃce. Thus the really important question forconsideration in this case is whether the duties of the Pujari'8 oﬃce can be got done by a substitute and if so isthere any particular reason or clearly established usage, against a female employing such a substitute and thusbecoming entitled to the oﬃce.In early Hindu society a priestly oﬃce could have relation only to the performance of various kinds of Vedic ritualsand sacriﬁces either of a daily and routine nature or of a periodical and special nature. In theory a Brahmin is toperform such functions for himself by himself, while persons of other classes ,should get them done through.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9564 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)qualiﬁed Brahmin,s. On principle a, priest in the Hindu concept is chosen as such with reference to his personalqualities and competence. The system of hereditary priesthood however, with the possibility of persons not fully25 194 competent, succeeding to or occupying such an oﬃce, appears to have come into vogue from fairly earlytimes. It appears, however, that from the very nature of the situation, the temporary discharge of the priestlyfunction by a substitute in the place of the hereditary priest was a matter of inevitable necessity since the HinduShastras recognised temporary and casual disqualiﬁcations like that of butt and death pollution. But there doesnot appear to be any indication in the early books of any general practice about the functions of priestly oﬃcebeing discharged by proxies. In comparatively later days, however, there is clear indication of such a practice. InSaraswati's Hindu Law of Endowments at page 56, it is stated that in the Padma Purana and other treatisesincapacitated persons are directed to have the worship performed through Brahmins.This statement is with reference to the performance of service of an idol and has presumably reference to theincapacity of persons occupying a priestly oﬃce. In Colebrooke's translation of the Digest of Hindu Law onContracts and Successions with a commentary by Jagannatha Tercapanchanana (4th Edition, published byHigginbotham & Co., Madras, 1874), Vol. I, Book II, Chapter III, Section 11, pages 360 to 381 deal with the topic ofpartnership among priests jointly oﬃciating at holy rites. A perusal thereof and particularly of placita 28 to 44containing citations from various Smrutis with Jagannatha's commentary thereon, clearly indicate that theinstitution of hereditary priestship, became established by that date and that the performance of such priestlyfunctions by substitutes had deﬁnitely come into vogue. Various rules are propounded as to the sharing ofremuneration between the substitute priest and the hereditary priest when the former happens to perform thefunctions in the place of the latter. It is to be noticed that these passages from Jagannatha's Digest refer in termsonly to priestly oﬃce by way of oﬃciating at holy rites, i.e., sacriﬁces and other Vedic or Shastric functions but donot in terms refer to the discharge of a priest's duties in relation to the worship of an idol in a temple.195 This is all the more remarkable because by the date of Jagannatha's Digest the institution of worship ofconsecrated idols in temples had become long since fairly established. The probable explanation is thatJagannatha's Digest is a commentary on selected texts mostly of the various Smrutis from which he quotes andthat in the days of the Smrutis the temple worship does not appear to have come suﬃciently into vogue. Thehistorical origin and growth of temple worship has been fully dealt with in Saraswati's Hindu Law of Endowmentsand has been also noticed in the referring judgment in Annaya Tantri v. Ammaka Hengsu(1). It is pointed outtherein that according to Hindu sentiment the performance of the duties of an Archaka or Pujari for an idol hasbeen considered sinful and it required inducements by way of liberal grants of land and promise of substantialperquisites to attract competent persons for the oﬃce of Pujari or Archaka. This, in course of time and with thechange in social conditions and economic values, rendered the oﬃces of Panda and Pujari in almost all the famousshrines in India, a lucrative aﬀair, and has enabled the hereditary priests to get the functions discharged by paidsubstitutes and themselves enjoy a substantial margin of income. Here just in the same way as the patronage ofthe kings or the society may have been a great incentive to the development of the system of discharge ofhereditary priestly functions by substitutes in relation to sacriﬁcial and Vedic religious rites, the phenomenaldevelopment and worship of idols in temples and the substantial emoluments which in course of time renderedthe discharge of priestly oﬃce lucrative must have brought into vogue the employment of substitutes forperformance of the duties of the priests not only for sacriﬁcial or other religious rites but also for temple worship.Whether and how far this practice is permitted by the Shastras is not the question before us.But it cannot be denied and is indeed a matter of common knowledge, that at the present day, hereditary priestlyoﬃces are, as often as not, performed by proxies, (1) A.l.P, 1919 'Madras 598 (F,B.).196 the choice of proxy being, of course, limited to a small circle permitted by usage. The question forconsideration of the courts is, whether, in this state of things, a female is to be excluded from succession to thehereditary oﬃce of Pujari on account of her well recognised personal disqualiﬁcation to oﬃciate as such Pujari forthe Shastrically installed and consecrated idols in the temples and whether she is to be denied the capacity toretain the property by getting the priestly duties eﬃciently discharged through a competent substitute. The onlybasis for the alleged denial is a passage from Jagannatha's Digest which is as follows: (Vide Vol. 1, page 379,commentary under placitum 43).""Wives and others, disqualiﬁed by sex for the performance of holy rites, cannot appoint a substitute; as deﬁledperson cannot perform a solemn act ordained by the Vedas, therefore wives have no property in the oﬃce ofpriest""..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9565 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)Now apart from the question whether this passage can be taken to be suﬃciently authoritative, there has beensome diﬀerence of opinion as to the correct import thereof. In Sundarambal Ammal v. Yogavanagurukkal(1) thispassage has been relied upon by Justice Sadasiva Aiyar as showing that women are incompetent to discharge thefunctions of a priest even through a substitute and that, therefore, they have no right of succession to the oﬃce.The learned Judges of the High Court in the present case have also relied on it.In Annaya Tantri v. Ammaka Hengsu(2), Justice Seshagiri Aiyar in his referring judgment has referred to thispassage and was of the opinion that it does not express a speciﬁc view. In Ganapathi Iyer on Hindu andMahomedan Endowments (2nd Edn.) the learned author while commenting on this very passage says as follows atpage 453 of his book:""Jagannatha there considers the question whether wives and others have a title to the succession to this priestlyoﬃce. As usual with the discussions of (1) A.I.R. 1915 Mad. 561.(2) A.I.R. 1919 Mad. 598 (F.B.).197 Jagannatha it is diﬃcult to say what his ﬁnal opinion is.But we should certainly think that Jagannatha's opinion is that women can inherit doing the duties through asubstitute, but enjoying the emoluments attached to that oﬃce"".It appears on a careful consideration of the disputed passage with reference to its context, that this view' of thelearned author is correct. In any case the passage cannot be deﬁnitely relied upon as an authority for the contraryview. The discussion in connection with which this passage occurs in the commentary is under placitum No. 43 inSection II of Chapter III, Book II, which is a text from Narada relating to hereditary priests. The statement relied onoccurs at a place where there is an attempt to reconcile the disqualiﬁcation of the female to discharge thefunctions of a hereditary priest, and the recognition of her right to succeed to all property including a hereditaryoﬃce. The relevant portions of the discussion are herein below set out:""It is doubted whether wives and others have a title to this succession, although the partition founded on theadmission of a right vesting in Agraharicas and other oﬃciating priests, ought to be similar to the partition ofinheritance in general. As the wife's title to succession, on failure of heirs in the male line as far as the great-grandson, will be declared under the head of Inheritance, what should reverse her title in this instance? It shouldnot be argued, that the wife can have no right to the village, because as a woman, she is disqualiﬁed for theperformance of holy rites, and because the wives of agraharicas and others are totally incapable of receiving tiladelivered as a gift to priests. The tila may be received, and the rites be performed, through the intervention of asubstitute. Let it not be argued, that, were it so, a property in the sacriﬁcial fee and regular dues would vest in thesubstitute. The wife may have the beneﬁt of property acquired by the substitute, as a sacriﬁcer has the beneﬁt ofrites per formed by an oﬃciating priest. However, there is this diﬀerence: the sacriﬁcer acquires merit from rites198 performed by an oﬃciating priest, and none is ever acquired by the intermediate performer of the rites; but ifthe duty of the oﬃciating priest. be performed by a substitute, property in the sacriﬁcial fee is at ﬁrst vested in thesubstitute, and through him, in the widow entitled thereto. It is alleged, that there is no authority for thisconstruction.* * * * The text which ordains that ""a person unable to act shall appoint another to act for him"", is the foundationof this construction: but the property of an outcaste, or other person disqualiﬁed for solemn rites, is absolutelylost, in the same manner with his right to the paternal gold, silver, and the like. This will be explained in the ﬁfthbook on Inheritance. Wives and others, disqualiﬁed by sex for the performance of holy rites, cannot appoint asubstitute: as a deﬁled person cannot perform a solemn act ordained by the Vedas: therefore wives have noproperty in the oﬃce of priest"".At the end of the discussion there is the following signiﬁcant passage:""Therefore the diﬃculty is thus reconciled; women are entitled to that only for which they are qualiﬁed. In regardto the assertion, that women, being disqualiﬁed, cannot appoint a substitute, this must be understood: beingdisqualiﬁed for solemn acts ordained by the Vedas, they cannot appoint a substitute for such acts; but, qualiﬁedfor worldly acts, nothing prevents their appointment of a substitute for temporal aﬀairs: and the right shoulddevolve on the next in succession, under the text quoted in another place (Book 5, v. 477) and because women aredependent on men. Grain and similar property may be consumed by a woman entitled to the succession; but gold,silver, and the like, should be preserved: if she cannot guard it, let it be entrusted to her husband's heir, as will be.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9566 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)mentioned under the title of inheritance. Here, since a woman cannot preserve the oﬃce, it should be executed byher husband's daughter's son, or other heir: but the produce 199 should be enjoyed by the woman. However,should the daughter's son be at variance with his maternal grandmother, it may be executed by another person: heis not entitled to his maternal grandfather's property, if that grandfather leave a wife: and should the maternalgrandmother litigate, it must be amicably adjusted"".The concluding portion seems rather to indicate that the more categorical passage underlined above and reliedupon is in the nature of an objection which is being answered and that the ﬁnal conclusion is the recognition of aright to succeed by getting the duties of the oﬃce performed by the next male in succession. The learned Judgesof the High Court have in fact noticed this concluding passage but have missed its correct import.It is desirable now to consider how this question stands with reference to the decided cases in the various HighCourts. A fairly substantial number of cases appear in the reports of the Madras High Court. One of the earliestdecisions is that of the Madras Sadar Diwani Adalat in Seshu Ammal v. Soundaraja Aiyar(1) wherein it was held,following the opinion of the Sadar Court Pandits, that a woman was disqualiﬁed by reason of her sex frominheriting the oﬃce of Acharya purusha but the same Pandits' opinion distinctly recognises that religious oﬃceslike those of an Archaka or Pujari can be held by a female, by her getting the duties thereof performed through acompetent male substitute. In Tangirala Chiranjivi v. Rama Manikya Rao Rajaya Lakshmamma(2) it was stated thatthere was no basis for the assumption that a minor, a female, or a person unlearned in the Vedas, will lose the rightto service in the temple and that the onus will be on the person who alleges the dis- qualiﬁcation to prove it. Thelearned Judges categorically asserted (apparently as being a matter within general knowledge and experience)that ""service in temples is being performed by proxies"". In Ramasundaram Pillai v.Savundaratha Ammal(3) the learned Judges say as follows:(1) [ 1863] M.S.D.A. 261.(2) A.I.R. 1915 Madras 505(1).(3) A.I.R. 1915 Madras 725.200 ""It is undeniable that this and other High Courts have in -numerous cases acted on the assumption (which wasnot questioned) that women could hold religious oﬃces and get the duties performed by proxy"".They further say ""It may be that the parties concerned are so accustomed to the idea of female oﬃce-holders withproxies that it has usually not occurred to them to question the legality of such a state of aﬀairs and that in theabsence of contest, the Courts have somewhat too readily assumed it to be legal without requiring proof of a validcustom in support of it"".In Rajeswari Ammal v. Subramania Archaka(1) the learned Judges state as follows:""We are of the opinion that a female is not, under Hindu law or custom, disqualiﬁed from succeeding to ahereditary religious oﬃce and getting such duties as she may be disqualiﬁed by reason of her sex from performing,performed by proxy"".The only dissentient view against this current of authority in the Madras High Court was that of Justice SadasivaAiyar in Sundarambal Ammal v. Yogavanagurukkal (2) . He expressed a strong opinion that the practice of allowingthe priestly oﬃce to be performed by a substitute excepting for merely temporary occasions or casual purposes, iswholly opposed to public policy and that it should not be recognised. In a later judgment in Annaya Tantri v.Ammaka Hengsu(3) relating to the same topic be (Justice Sadasiva Aiyar) stated as follows:""It is notorious that the deputy is usually chosen on the principle of a Dutch auction. The man who agrees to allowthe widow to retain the largest portion of the emoluments of the oﬃce and to receive the least as his ownremuneration is given the place of the deputy"".The learned Judge pointed out that ""such a practice was mischievous and that even (1) A.I.R. 1917 Madras 963(2).(2) A.I.R. 1915 Madras 561.(3) A.I.R.1919 Madras 598 (F.B.)..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9567 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)201 if it was sanctioned by usage it ought not to be recognised by courts"".There is certainly force in this comment. But in a matter of this kind where there is no express prohibition in thetexts for the performance of the duties of the Pujari's oﬃce by the appointment of substitutes and where such anoﬃce has developed into a hereditary right of property, the consideration of public policy cannot be insisted to theextent of negativing the right itself. In such a situation what has to be equally emphasised is the duty-aspect of theoﬃce and to insist, on the superior authorities in charge of the temple exercising vigilantly their responsibility bycontrolling the then incumbent of the priestly oﬃce in the exercise of his rights (or by other persons havinginterest taking appropriate steps through court), when it is found that the services are not being properly oreﬃciently performed. In view of the peculiar nature of such oﬃces as combining in them both the element ofproperty and the element of duty, it cannot be doubted that superior authorities in charge of the institutions orother persons interested have this right which may be enforced by appropriate legal means. In Raja Peary MohanMukherji v.Manohar Mukherji(1) the Privy Council has recognised that notwithstanding the personal interest of a Shebait inrespect of his oﬃce, the performance of the duties thereof has got to be safeguarded and that he can be removedwhere he has put himself in a position in which the obligation of his oﬃce can no longer be faithfully discharged.So far as the Madras High Court area is concerned, the controversy has been settled by the Full Bench case inAnnaya Tantri v. Ammaka Hengsu(2) where the view taken by Justice Sadasiva Aiyar was speciﬁcally overruled onthe ground that ""there were numerous decisions of the Madras High Court in conformity with the decisions of theother High Courts by which the widow and the daughter and the daughter (1) [ 1921] L.R. 48 I.A. 258.(2) A.I.R. 1919 Madras 598 (F.B.).26 202 of the last male Archaka are held entitled in accordance with the established user to succeed to the oﬃce ofArchaka discharging his duties by deputy and to transmit it to their heirs, who as male heirs are preferred tofemale, and will generally be competent to perform the duties in person"". These decisions of the Madras HighCourt seem to recognise both the factum and validity of the usage as one that has been accepted by the courts notonly within its own jurisdiction but also within the jurisdiction of the other High Courts. It is urged, however, thatthere is no such usage that can be deﬁnitely said to be established with reference to the decisions of the otherHigh Courts.As regards the other High Courts doubtless the actual cases appearing in the reports about this point are notmany. In the Bombay High Court one of the earliest decisions is the case in 1866 of Keshavbhat bin Ganeshbhat v.Bhagirhibai kom Narayanbhat(1) where the learned Judges say as follows:""With respect to the objection, that a Hindu female cannot perform the duties which attach to the oﬃce for themaintenance of which the allowance was granted, it may be observed that the defendant had not proved theexistence of any usage in conformity with his allegations.The claim in question in that case was to an annual allowance paid from the Government Treasury to the membersof a family for the maintenance of certain religious services at the temple of Mahadev at Baneshvar near Poona.In Sitarambhat et al v. Sitaram Ganesh(2) the head-note shows as follows:""Semble, that an hereditary priestly oﬃce descends in default of males through females"".This is apparently the assumption on which that judgment appears to have proceeded though the matter does notappear to have been speciﬁcally so decided. In Calcutta one of the early cases is Poorun Narain Dutt v.Kasheessuree Dosee(3). There it was recognised that a woman can succeed to a priestly (1) 3 B.H.C.R., A.C.J. 75. (2)6 B.H.C.R. A.C.J. 250.(3) [ 1865] 3 W.R. 179.203 oﬃce and the contention to the contrary was over. ruled on the ground that the lower appellate court foundthe same as a fact on the evidence and that no one but the defendant had raised the contention. In Joy Deb Surmav. Huroputty Surma(1) the same question was raised, viz., whether according to Hindu law a woman can succeedto the priestly oﬃce and reliance appears to have been placed for that contention on the passage fromColebrooke's Digest already above referred to. In view of this contention the learned Judges remitted the case to.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9568 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)the lower court for deter- mination of the question whether with reference to any particular custom or rule ofHindu law a woman is entitled to succeed to the priestly oﬃce. In that case it was the oﬃce of the Dolloi of thetemple. It does not appear what the ﬁnding received was and how this matter was ﬁnally decided. In Radha MohunMundul v. Jadoomonee Dossee(2) their Lordships of the Judicial Committee quoted with apparent approval thefollowing passage from the judgment of the trial Court:""They (the members of the family) merely say that as the said properties are of a debuttur character, they are notsusceptible of division among the shareholders; and that since the plaintiﬀ is a childless widow, she is notcompetent to carry on the service of the gods. That the properties in question do not admit of any partition amongthe co-sharers is a fact which must be admitted by me; but I do not see any reason why a widow of the familyshould be incapacitated from superintending the service of the gods.It is not urged by the defendants that any such rule has been laid down in the family, and that under it the widowshave been excluded from the above superintendence. On the other hand, among the Hindoos, persons belongingto no other caste except that of Brahmins can perform the service of a god with his own hands, that is, worship theidol by touching its person. Men of other castes simply superintend the service of the gods and goddessesestablished by them- selves, while they cause their actual worship to be (1) [ 1871] 16 W.R. 282.(2) 23 W.R. 369.204 performed by Brahmins. Thus, when persons of the above description can conduct the service of idols in theabove- mentioned manner, why should not the widows of their family be able to carry on worship in a similarway?................................ Consequently, there is nothing to prevent the Court from ﬁnding that the plaintiﬀ has aright to hold possession of the debutter properties enumerated by the defendants in the 12th paragraph of theirwritten statement, and to superintend the service of the gods conjointly with the other co-sharers"".In Mahamaya Debi v. Haridas Haldar(1) it has been recognised that according to custom the palas of Kalighatshrine in Calcutta are heritable and that it was immaterial whether the heir is a male or a female. This mustnecessarily have involved the recognition of the capacity of the female to get the worship performed by a malesubstitute who is to be taken from a limited class. As has been already noticed, the reported cases dealing withthis matter outside the Madras High Court do not appear to be many. At any rate, no others have been brought toour notice dealing with this question directly, though there are many cases relating to the question of successionto the oﬃce of Shebait and the performance of duties thereof by proxy, which is a matter distinguishable from acase relating to the oﬃce of Pujari or Archaka simpliciter. The paucity of decided cases in the reports of the otherHigh Courts may very well be due to what has been pointed out in one of the Madras cases, viz., that the practiceof females succeeding to this oﬃce and getting the duties thereof performed by a substitute was so common andwell recognised that it has not been seriously contested and brought up to the Courts. Further the institution ofprivate family temples and the endowments of large and substantial properties for the Deb-seva in such templesthough somewhat uncommon in South India is fairly common in Bengal and some other States. In view of theDayabhaga system of law of succession prevalent in Bengal and the very much larger number (1) A.I.R. 1915Calcutta 161(2).205 of occasions for wives and daughters succeeding to a sonless coparcener in Dayabhaga joint families, thepractice of females succeeding to the priestly oﬃce and of getting the duties performed by other members of thefamily as proxies in their places must, by the very situation, have been common in these areas. The case reportedin Jalandhar Thakur v. Jharula Das(1) is a case relating to Shebait's (priest's) oﬃce in the Singheswar temple ofBhagalpur and the facts therein show that there was unquestioned female succession to the oﬃce. It is a clearindication of the prevalence of the usage of female succession to priestly oﬃce in the State of Bihar from whichthe present case arises.A careful review, therefore, of the reported cases on this matter shows that the usage of a female succeeding to apriestly oﬃce and getting the same performed through a competent deputy is one that has been fairly wellrecognised. There is nothing in the textual Hindu law to the contrary. Nor can it be said that the recognition ofsuch a usage is opposed to public policy, in the Hindu law sense. As already pointed out the consideration of publicpolicy can only be given eﬀect in the present state of the law, to the extent required for enforcing adequatedischarge of the duties appurtenant to the oﬃce. Subject to the proper and eﬃcient discharge of the duties of theoﬃce, there can be no reason either on principle or on authority to refuse to accord to a female the right tosucceed to the hereditary oﬃce held by her husband and to get the duties of the oﬃce performed by a substitute.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/2.html/109595995895www9569 9/12/ 2020RAJ KALI KUER V. RAM RA TTAN PANDEY [15] INSC 26; AIR 15 SC 43; 15 (2) SCR 16 (7 April 15)excepting in cases where usage to the contrary is pleaded and established. In the present case such a usage waspleaded by the defendant in his written statement but no evidence of it was given.Indeed as pointed out by the ﬁrst appellate Court, the plea that there has been a partition of the oﬃces of the twotemples and the implied recognition of the plaintiﬀ 's right to the oﬃce of the other temple at Gangupal appears toindicate the contrary usage. We are accordingly of the opinion (1) A.I.R. 1914 P.C. 72.206 that the claim of the plaintiﬀ-appellant is made out and that she is entitled to succeed.The discussion above is more germane to the case of a public temple wherein the idol has been Shastricallyinstalled and consecrated and the worship is in accordance with the Shastras. There is nothing on the record toshow whether the temple in this case falls within this category. If, however, the temple is a private one or the idoltherein is not one Shastrically consecrated, the case in favour of the plaintiﬀ is much stronger and her right cannotbe seriously challenged. At this stage, it is desirable to mention one other matter. In the present case theemoluments attached to the oﬃce are stated to be the daily and other oﬀerings made to the deity at the worshipby the visiting devotees.Both the parties to this case have come up to Court on the common footing that it is this which constitutes theemoluments. Whether and how far such votive oﬀerings can be appropriated by a Pujari for his emoluments if thetemple is a public institution, (i.e., not a private family temple) and whether any usage in this behalf is valid is amatter which does not arise before us in this case.In the result, the appeal must be allowed with costs throughout and the decree of the trial court must be restored."

April 15. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA J.-This is an appeal against the judgment andorder dated the 4th September 1951 of the Calcutta High Court in its appellate jurisdiction reversing those datedthe 29th August 1950 of a Judge of that Court sitting on the Original Side granting the appellant's prayer forrevoking and annulling the probate granted in respect of the last will and testament dated the 29th July 1912 ofone Binod Lal Ghosh, deceased, whom we shall call the testator in the course of this judgment.The testator is said to have executed a will on the 29th July 1912 which was registered on the same date at theCalcutta registry oﬃce. By the said will the testator appointed the following ﬁve persons as executors orexecutrices:- (1) Anil Nath Basu, Attorney-at-Law (2) Brindaban Chandra Mitter (These two also ﬁgure as attestingwitnesses to the will) (3) His adopted son Charu Chandra Ghose (whom we shall call Charu for the sake of brevity) aminor on his attaining majority.272 (4) His wife Haimabati Dasi, and (5) His brother's widow Muktakesi Dasi.He also directed that on the death of the said Anil Nath Basu, his son Achintya Nath Basu, and on the death ofBrindaban Chandra Mitter, his son Debi Prosad Mitter will take their places respectively as executors; and on thedeath of his wife Haimabati Dasi, Charu's wife, Latikabala Dasi, and on the death of Muktakesi Dasi, his nephew'swife Sushamabala Dasi, will take her place respectively as executrix. It is not necessary to set out in detail thelegacies created by the will except to state that he created annuities in favour of a number of persons including hiswife, his brother's widow . Muktakesi Dasi, his daughter-in- law, his niece-in-law aforesaid and Charu. He alsomade provision in his will for annual payments in respect of the expenses of certain deities and festivals, as also forthe funeral expenses of himself and the annuitants aforesaid.He directed his executors to accumulate Rs. 12,000 a year out of the balance left after meeting the annuities andthe other annual expenses aforesaid to be paid over to Charu upon the death of the said Latikabala Dasi andSushama Bala Dasi who were to share the residue, if any, after paying the annuities and other outgoings referredto above. It would thus appear that though the testator intended Charu to be the owner of his entire estateincluding the accumulations after meeting the annuities and the other annual expenses, he did not trust him to theextent of putting that estate into his hands immediately on his attaining majority. He trusted Charu's wife and theother ladies in his family more than Charu himself, though he speciﬁcally stated in the will- ""Provided always thatthe said adopted son shall be deemed to have a vested interest in the said estate immediately on my death"".He appointed his wife Haimabati Dasi as the guardian of the person and property of Charu and of his wifeLatikabala Dasi aforesaid.On the 5th March 1920 the testator is said to have been murdered by Charu who was placed on his trial, 273convicted for murder and sentenced to transportation for life. Charu served his term of imprisonment and wasreleased from jail some time in 1933.On the 30th September 1921 an application for probate of the will aforesaid was made on the Original Side of theCalcutta High Court on behalf of Anil Nath, Muktakesi Dasi and Latikabala Dasi aforesaid. The application statedthat the testator died on the 5th March 1920 at Baranagar, leaving him surviving his adopted son Charu and hiswidow Haimabati Dasi. The will dated the 29th July 1912 was recited and the ﬁve persons named above were saidto have been appointed executors and executrices of the will. It also stated that Brindaban Chandra Mitter, one ofthe executors named in the will, had died in July 1913 and his son Debi Prosad Mitter was a minor. It also recited.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/15/28. h/02095956957i95wwwiiase95tml29 9/12/2ANIL BEHARI GHOSH V. SMT .

The prayer was ""that probateof the said will may be granted to your petitioners limited within the Province of Bengal reserving power of makingthe like grant to the said Charu Chandra Ghose and the said Debi Prosad Mitter (when he comes of age) when theywill come and pray for the same"". The grant was made the same day (i.e., 30th September 1921) which fell duringthe long vacation and the Judge in charge passed the order- ""Order as prayed"" no citations being issued. This ismaterial in view of what has been alleged subsequently about this grant, as will presently appear.Nothing was heard about these proceedings until the 24th July 1933 when an application was made by DebiProsad Mitter aforesaid for the grant of probate to him along with Anil Nath Basu and Latikabala Dasi. In thatapplication, the previous grant of probate dated the 30th September, 1921, the death of Muktakesi Dasi some timein October 1932 and the 274 fact of his attaining majority some time in January 1924 are recited. On the 16thSeptember 1933 Debi Prosad Mitter's application was granted.It appears that Latikabala Dasi and Sushamabala Dasi applied to the Calcutta High Court on the 4th December1933 for an order for discharging the executors appointed previously and for a direction to hand over the entireestate of the testator to the applicants. In answer to the summons Debi Prosad Mitter made an aﬃdavit on the 7thDecember 1933 in which he recited the previous grants of the probate made in 1921 and 1933; and stated that thetestator Binod Lal Ghosh was murdered on the 5th March 1920 by Charu and that on the death of Haimabati inMay 1921, the testator's ﬁrst cousin Girish Chandra Ghosh became entitled to the residue of the estate of thetestator. In that aﬃdavit be set out the genealogical table of the family of the testator showing how GirishChandra Ghosh was related to the deceased. He also made pointed reference to the fact that the survivinggrantees of the probate, Anil Nath Basu and Latikabala Dasi, after the death of Haimabati bad not ﬁled anyaccount of the testator's estate in their capacity as executor and executrix respectively and that on his obtainingprobate of the will those persons had not complied with his request of furnishing a statement of accounts abouttheir dealings with the testator's estate. He also set out the text of the letter sent by his solicitor to Anil Nath Basuand Latikabala Dasi. The letter is dated the 4th December 1933.It does not appear from the record as to what attitude had been taken by the executor and the executrix aforesaidin answer to the call made by Debi Prosad Mitter for submission of accounts of their dealings with the testator'sestate after the grant of probate in 1921 as aforesaid.Ultimately, on the 16th May, 1934 the High Court dismissed the application for discharging the persons who hadbeen granted the probate. Girish Chandra Ghosh aforesaid died in December, 1940 without having taken any stepsin court claiming his rights, whatever they were, in the 275 testator's estate. Anil Nath Basu also died in July, 1948.He does not appear from the record to have rendered any accounts in respect of his dealings as the managingexecutor of the will of the deceased.It was not until the 17th September, 1949 that the appellant, who is one of the four sons of the said Girish ChandraGhosh, made an application to the Calcutta High Court on the Original Side praying that the probates dated the30th September, 1921, and the 16th September, 1933 in respect of the will dated the 29th July, 1912 be revoked,annulled and/or set aside and that an administrator pendente lite be appointed. The petition runs into abouttwenty printed pages setting out the petitioner's relationship with the testator, the will and the grant of theprobates as aforesaid, the murder of the testator by Charu, his trial, conviction and sentence for that murder. Itwas also averred that the testator had ""intended to revoke his said will of 29th July, 1912"". Then follows a longrecital of facts tending to that conclusion. Then follows para 19 which is in these terms:- ""From the saidcorrespondence and papers it is absolutely clear that the said testator revoked his will of 29th July, 1912. Yourpetitioner submits that arrangements were being made for handing over the estate of the said Binod Lal Ghosh,deceased, in the hands of the Administrator-General of Bengal for the purpose of charity but the said purpose didnot mature and under the circumstances your petitioner submits that the said will of 29th July, 1912 has beenrevoked by the said testator and no further will was executed in its place or stead"".Para. 23 is a statement of the grounds on which the case for revocation of the grants is founded.

It was denied by her that the said Girish Chandra Ghosh wasthe nearest male relative of the testator or that Charu had murdered his adoptive father. It was also denied thatthe testator had revoked his will and that he died intestate as a result of which the petitioner and his threebrothers became entitled to succeed to his estate. Achintya Nath Basu took similar grounds in opposition to theapplication for revocation.Debi Prosad Mitter by an aﬃdavit -of his own denied that there had been any just cause for revoking the probatebut added that he had been discharged on his own application from further acting as one of the executors of thetestator's will.Though no issues were framed, the main grounds for revocation or annulment of the probates were as stated inpara. 23 set out above. Mr. Justice P. B. Mukherjee who dealt with the case on the Original Side, after an elaborateconsideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, passed orders revoking 277 and annulling the grantsaforesaid and directing ""that the will be proved in solemn form on notice to the applicant and the other sons ofGirish and also after a general citation to all persons interested in the estate"". He also appointed the applicant, theappellant before us, as an administrator pendente lite with usual powers to take charge of the estate, with costs tothe applicant to be paid out of the estate. He directed the other opponents-respondents to bear their own costs.On the points in controversy he came to the conclusion that Girish was related to the testator as a cousin, thatthere was no acquiescence on the part of Girish barring the appellant from pursuing his remedy, that the non-citation of Girish was by itself not suﬃcient to invalidate the grant, but that circumstance in conjunction with otherfacts, viz., of material concealment of the fact that Charu bad murdered the testator and that the testator hadentertained an intention to revoke the will, though it had not actually been revoked, was suﬃcient ground forrevoking the grant. He held further, on the authority of the decision in Mokshadayini v. Karnadhar(1) that thequestion whether the will bad as a matter of fact been revoked would form the subject matter for ﬁnaldetermination after the revocation of the grants when fresh proceedings will be taken after due citation. He alsoheld that in the circumstances of this case, though there was no averment of wilful default in exhibiting aninventory and accounts of the testator's estate the executors were actually guilty of such a default and there wasthus just cause for revoking the grant. He did not hold the other grounds of attack against the grant made out bythe applicant; that is to say, he did not ﬁnd it established that the estate was worth over Rs. 40,00,000 and that thedeclaration of the value of the testator's estate at Rs.4,75,780 was false or fraudulent or that the grant bad become useless or inoperative otherwise, or that the casecould not be heard by the Calcutta High Court, on the Original Side.On appeal by Latikabala Dasi, the Appellate Beach (1) 19 C.W.N. 1108, 278 consisting of Sir Trevor Harries, C. J. andBanerjee, J., allowed the appeal and dismissed the application for revocation of the probate with costs of both thecourts.They held that the will in question was genuine and valid in view of the evidence and of the fact that itsgenuineness or validity had not been questioned speciﬁcally in the pleadings. They also held that there was no.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/15/28. h/02095956957i95wwwiiase95tml49 9/12/2ANIL BEHARI GHOSH V. SMT . LATIKA BALA DASSI & ORS [15] INSC 28; AIR 15 SC 56; 15 (2) SCR 20 ( 15 Ap rl 15)revocation of the will or even an intention on the part of the testator to revoke the will. They also held that Girishwas entitled to citation but that the non-citation did not materially aﬀect the grant of the probate and that at anyrate, Girish being fully aware of the grant stood by, and therefore acquiesced in the grant, and did not take anysteps at the right time to question the grant. They therefore did not think it just and expedient to reopen theproceedings when they were satisﬁed that there was no real and substantial attack against the genuineness andvalidity of the will itself.In this appeal it has been argued on behalf of the appellant on the authority of the decision in Mokshadayini v.Karnadhar(1) that the Appeal Court should have agreed with the Judge on the Original Side in holding that therewas material concealment of facts which considered along with the admitted position that no citation had beentaken against Girish Chandra Ghosh had vitiated the proceedings for the grant of probate and that the question ofthe genuineness or validity of the will should have been left over for determination at a later stage of theproceedings.It was also argued that the omission to exhibit the accounts was in the circumstances of this case wilful defaultwithout reasonable cause within the meaning of the law and was suﬃcient by itself to entitle the applicant to arevocation. It was also argued that no grounds had been made out in fact to support the legal conclusion drawn bythe Appeal Court that there had been an acquiescence on the part of Girish. On behalf of the 1st respondent theconclusion of the Appeal Bench has been supported on all the grounds. On behalf of the respondent Debi ProsadMitter, it (1) 19 C.W N. 1108.279 was contended that he had been unnecessarily impleaded at all the stages and that he should have beengranted his costs out of the estate of the deceased.The grant of probate was made under the provisions of the Probate and Administration Act (V of 1881); but theIndian Succession Act (XXXIX of 1925) consolidated the law relating to intestate and testamentary succession andthus incorporated the other Acts relating to the same subject, including Act V of 1881. In order to be entitled to arevocation or annulment of the grant aforesaid the appellant has to bring his case within the purview of section263 of the Indian Succession Act (XXXIX of 1925), which will hereinafter be referred to as the Act). Section 263 ofthe Act is substantially in the same terms as section 50 of Act V of 1881. Section 263 provides that ""The grant ofprobate or letters of administration may be revoked or annulled for just cause"". Under the Explanation- ""Just causeshall be deemed to exist where-- (a) the proceedings to obtain the grant were defective in substance, or (b) thegrant was obtained fraudulently by making a false suggestion, or by concealing from the court something materialto the case, or (c) the grant was obtained by means of an untrue allegation of a fact essential in point of law tojustify the grant, though such allegation was made in ignorance or inadvertently, or (d) the grant has becomeuseless and inoperative through circumstances, or (e)the person to whom the grant was made has wilfully andwithout reasonable cause omitted to exhibit an inventory or account in accordance with the provisions of ChapterVII of this Part, or has exhibited under that Chapter an inventory or account which is untrue in a material respect"".After the explanation, there are eight illustrations of the grounds on which a grant of probate may be revoked, ofwhich the ﬁrst three are material. They are as follows:- 280 "" (i) The court by which the grant was made had nojurisdiction.(ii) The grant was made without citing parties who ought to have been cited.(iii) The will of which probate was obtained was forged or revoked"".In this case the appellant tried to take advantage of the ﬁrst illustration also, by suggesting in one of the groundsset out in para. 23 of his petition quoted above that the testator never lived within the Ordinary Original CivilJurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court in exercise of which the grant in question had been made. But that groundwas negatived by the trial Judge and as it was not pressed before us, no more need be said about it.It was vehemently argued at all stages of the case including the appeal before us that admittedly no citation wasissued against Girish Chandra Ghosh aforesaid and as he was the person most interested in the testator's estatebesides the legatees named in the will, the case came directly within the purview of clause (a) of the Explanationand Illustration (ii) quoted above. Girish Chandra Ghosh has been found by the Judge in the ﬁrst instance to havebeen the person most vitally interested in the estate of the testator, whether he died intestate or leaving a will, inthe events which had happened. The learned counsel for the contesting respondent suggested that it had notbeen found by the lower Appellate Court as a fact upon the evidence adduced in this case, that Girish was the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/15/28. h/02095956957i95wwwiiase95tml59 9/12/2ANIL BEHARI GHOSH V.

The courts below have referred to good and reliable evidence in support of the ﬁnding thatGirish was the nearest reversioner to the estate of the testator. If the will is a valid and genuine will, there isintestacy in respect of the interest created in favour of Char;, if he was the murderer of the testator. On thisquestion the courts below have assumed on the basis of the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by theHigh Court in the sessions trial that Charu was the 281 murderer. Though that judgment is relevant only to showthat there was such a trial resulting in the conviction and sentence of Charu to transportation for life, it is notevidence of the fact that Charu was the murderer. That question has to be decided on evidence. However, forpurposes of this case we shall assume in favour of the appellant that Charu was the murderer. The result of such anassumption is that Girish being the nearest reversioner to the estate of the testator, in case of intestacy after thedeath of the testator's widow in 1921; or in case of testamentary succession after the death of the two legatees,the testator's daughter-in-law and the nephew's wife aforesaid, and the failure of the legacy in favour of Charu onaccount of the murder would, in either event, have suﬃcient interest in the estate of the testator to entitle him tochallenge the grant and to obtain revocation. But it is noteworthy that Girish who died in 1940, lived for about 19years after the grant and took no steps in that direction. There may be some doubt as to Girish's knowledge of theprobate proceedings and of the grant until 1933; but, in our opinion, there is ample evidence in support of theﬁnding arrived at by the Court of Appeal below that Girish was aware of the grant at the latest in 1933 when DebiProsad Mitter took -proceedings to obtain a grant in his own favour also. In his application, as indicated above, heclearly stated that Charu was the murderer of his adoptive father and that Girish would succeed to his estate,which otherwise would have gone to Charu. If Girish had initiated proceedings for revocation of the grant and hadinsisted on the will being proved in his presence, the courts would have had no diﬃculty in having all the necessaryevidence before it because the chief person who had played the most leading part in the execution of the will, in itsregistration and in its being admitted to probate, viz., Anil Nath Basu, was then alive and could have beenexamined.But for reasons not made clear in these proceedings Girish did not think it worth his while to take any steps incourt to 36 282 challenge the will or the grant. The estate was worth anything between ﬁve to forty lakhs, perhapsnearer ﬁve lakhs than forty lakhs. Girish was a mere pensioner belonging to a middle class family. Either he did notthink it worth his while to embark on a litigation with all its uncertainties or he had not the wherewithal to do so.The record as it stands does not satisfactorily explain the reasons why Girish refrained from making any attemptsto get this large estate. If the will was not genuine or valid, Girish would take the reversionary estate at oncebecause the testator's widow died in 1921 and there was no other impediment in his way, except to get rid of thewill. If, on the other hand, the will was genuine- and valid, even then he would stand to gain all the interest whichhad been bequeathed in favour of Charu. The fact that Girish did not take advantage of his position as the nearestreversioner as on partial intestacy goes a long way to support the great probability of the will being valid andgenuine, especially as it had been probated and because the appellant in his long petition for revoking the granthas not made the least suggestion casting any doubt on the genuineness and validity of the will. But it was arguedon behalf of the appellant that that stage had not yet arrived and that it would be open to the appellant afterobtaining an order of revocation of the grant to show that the will was either not genuine or had not been validlyexecuted. Great reliance was placed in this connection on the judgment of a Division Bench of the Calcutta HighCourt in Mokshadayini Dasi v. Karnadhar Mandal (1) where the following observations have been made:- ""Noquestion of the genuineness of the will arises for consideration till the court has decided that the probate must berevoked on one or more of the grounds speciﬁed in section 50 of the Probate and Administration Act. The onlymatter for consideration at this stage is, whether the appellants have made out a just cause for revocation of theprobate which was granted without notice to them: Brindaban v. Suresh- (1) 19 C.W.N 1108.283 war(1). The question of genuineness cannot be considered till a case for revocation is made out: Durgavati v.Sourabini(2)"".The observations relied upon by the appellant were made with reference to the facts of that case and were notintended to be of universal application. As pointed out above, section 263 of the Act also contemplates a case forrevocation based on the single ground that the will in respect of which the grant- in question was obtained was aforged one. In such a case, whether or not the will was a forged one would be the only question to be canvassedbefore the court before the order of revocation could be made.It was further argued on behalf of the appellant that the appeal should be allowed and the grant revoked on thesimple ground, apart from any other considerations, that there had been no citation issued to Girish. In ouropinion, this proposition also is ,much too widely stated. Section 263 of the Act vests a judicial discretion in the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/15/28. h/02095956957i95wwwiiase95tml69 9/12/2ANIL BEHARI GHOSH V. SMT . LATIKA BALA DASSI & ORS [15] INSC 28; AIR 15 SC 56; 15 (2) SCR 20 ( 15 Ap rl 15)court to revoke or annul a grant for just cause. The explanation has indicated the circumstances in which the courtcan come to the conclusion that ""just cause"" had been made out. In this connection the appellant relied uponclause (a) quoted above which requires that the proceedings resulting in the grant sought to be revoked shouldhave been ""defective in substance"". We are not inclined to hold that they were ""defective in substance"". ""Defectivein substance"" must mean that the defect was of such a character as to substantially aﬀect the regularity andcorrectness of the previous proceedings. If there were any suggestions in the present proceedings or anycircumstances were pointed out to show that if Girish had been cited he would have been able to enter a caveat,the absence of citation would have rendered those proceedings ""defective in substance"". It may be that Girishhaving been found to have been the next reversioner to the testator's estate in case of intestacy and on theassumption that Charu had murdered the testator, Girish might have been entitled to a revocation of the grant ifhe (1) 10 C.L.J. 263 at p. 273. (2) I.L.R. 33 Cal. 1001, 284 had moved shortly after the grant of the probate on thesimple ground that no citation had been issued to him. The omission to issue citations to persons who should havebeen apprised of the probate proceedings may well be in a normal case a ground by itself for revocation of thegrant. But this is not an absolute right irrespective of other considerations arising from the proved facts of a case.The law has vested a judicial discretion in the Court to revoke a grant where the court may have prima faciereasons to believe that it was necessary to have the will proved afresh in the presence of interested parties. But inthe present case we are not satisﬁed in all the circumstances of the case that just cause within the meaning ofsection 263 had been made out. We cannot ignore the facts that about 27 years had elapsed after the grant ofprobate in 1921, that Girish in spite of the knowledge of the grant at the latest in 1933 did not take any steps in hislifetime to have the grant revoked, that there was no suggestion that the will was a forgery or was otherwiseinvalid and that the will was a registered one and had been executed eight years before the testator's unnaturaldeath. Hence the omission of citations to Girish which ordinarily may have been suﬃcient for a revocation of thegrant was not in the special circumstances of this case suﬃcient to justify the court to revoke the grant.Learned Counsel for the appellant made pointed reference to the decision of their Lordships of the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council in Ramanandi Kuer v. Kalawati Kuer(1).But that case is an authority for the proposition that where two grounds are taken for revocation of a grant, viz.,(1) that persons who ought to have been cited were not cited, and (2) that the will was a forgery, if the ﬁrst groundis established, the onus is upon the opponents to prove that the will is genuine. That case is no authority for theproposition that in every case where there is a defect in citation, the court must order a revocation or annulment ofthe grant. The annulment is a matter of substance and not of mere form. The court (1) L.R. 55 I.A. 18, 285 mayrefuse to grant annulment in cases where there is no likelihood of proof being oﬀered that the will admitted toprobate was either not genuine or had not been validly executed. But, as rightly pointed out by the lowerAppellate Court, in the present case where the validity or genuineness of the will has not been challenged, it wouldserve no useful purpose to revoke the grant and to make the parties go through the mere formality of proving thewill over again. In our opinion, therefore, the omission of citation has had no eﬀect on the regularity of theproceedings resulting in the grant of 1921.It was next contended that there had been fraudulent concealment of material facts from the court in theproceedings of 1921, and that therefore the case came within the purview of clause (b) of the Explanation quotedabove.It was said in this connection that the petition for the grant of probate made in 1921 did not disclose the followingmaterial facts:1. That Charu was the murderer of the testator;2. That the testator had revoked the will or had at least intended to revoke the will; and3. That a false declaration as regards the value of the property constituting the estate of the deceased testator hadbeen made, that is to say, the applicants for probate had concealed from the court the true value of the propertywhich was forty lakhs of rupees and not only Rs. 4,75,780/- as stated by them.It is true that in para. 4 of the petition for probate it was only stated that Charu had been found guilty of murder bythe High Court and was sentenced to transportation for life and had not till then been released from jail. Ourattention was also called to the prayer portion of the petition in which the right of Charu to make an application forprobate had been reserved. We can easily dispose of the last suggestion by observing that it was a mere formalreservation. It has no such sinister signiﬁcance as is attributed to it. It is also true that there is no statement in the.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/15/28. h/02095956957i95wwwiiase95tml79 9/12/2ANIL BEHARI GHOSH V. SMT . LATIKA BALA DASSI & ORS [15] INSC 28; AIR 15 SC 56; 15 (2) SCR 20 ( 15 Ap rl 15)application that Charu had murdered the testator. While agreeing with the Judge in the ﬁrst court that this wasrather disingenuous, we must also 286 hold that that concealment, if it was deliberate, was not material to thecase. Even if that statement had been made in the petition, that would have had no eﬀect on the grant of probateto the petitioners who were before the court.The fact of the murder is relevant only to this extent, that it would aﬀect the legacies in favour of Charu, but theother legacies would stand and the will would still be open to probate.The last allegation relating to concealment is on the question of the value of the property left by the testator by hiswill. It is not necessary to consider whether if such a concealment had been made out it would have been suﬃcientto revoke the grant. It is enough to point out that neither of the courts below has found that the property wasreally worth anything like forty lakhs of rupees. This ground has not been pressed before us either. It musttherefore be held that the appellant has failed to bring his case within the rule of material concealment.The most serious allegation which could have a determining eﬀect on the grant, if made out, is that the testatorhad revoked the will. Such an allegation would directly come within the third illustration quoted above. Butunfortunately for the appellant he made no attempt to prove his allegation that there was any such revocation.Apart from showing that in or about the year 1917 the testator had entertained the intention either of materiallyaltering his will or of altogether revoking it, there is absolutely no evidence in support of the allegation that thetestator actually revoked the registered will in question. For proving that the will had been revoked, it had to beshown that the testator had made another will or codicil or by some writing declared his intention to revoke thewill.Such a document is required by section 70 of the Act to be executed in the same manner as a will. Such arevocation could also have been proved, as the section lays down, by burning, tearing or otherwise destroying thewill by the testator himself or by some other person in his presence and by his direction, thus clearly indicating hisintention 287 of revoking the will. No such proof has been oﬀered in this case. But it was argued that the appellantwould have oﬀered such proof after the order of revocation was made by the court. That would be to put the cartbefore the horse.If an applicant for revocation of a grant alleges as a ground for such revocation that the testator had revoked thewill, he has got to prove that alleged fact at least prima facie before he can be entitled to an order of revocation.There may be cases where such a proof may be oﬀered at a later stage where the revocation is founded uponother grounds, for example, where the court is satisﬁed that there was substantial defect in the previousproceedings resulting in the grant, or that the grantee had wilfully and without reasonable cause omitted toexhibit an inventory or account; or some such other ground recognized by section 263 as just cause for annullingthe grant has been established.It was also argued on behalf of the appellant that even though he may not have proved that the testator had as amatter of fact revoked the will, he is still entitled to an order of revocation on the ground that he bad entertainedthe intention of revoking the will. No authority had been cited before us in support of this contention. It is open toa person who has made a will at any time to alter or to revoke it; but if he has died leaving a registered will and hasnot taken any tangible steps to revoke such a will, it is not enough to allege that the testator had at one timeentertained the intention of doing so, because such an intention without being translated into action has no eﬀecton the will actually left by him which must be treated as the last will and testament.It remains to consider the last point, viz., whether the case is within clause (e) of the explanation to section 263.In this connection ground (f) in paragraph 23 of the petition quoted above is the only allegation. The omission tosubmit accounts is not always synonymous with ""wilfully and without reasonable cause"" omitting to exhibitaccounts.In certain circumstances omission to submit accounts 288 may bring the case within the purview of clause (e)aforesaid because the circumstances may tend to show that the omission was wilful and without reasonablecause. We have therefore to consider whether in the circumstances of this case the omission to ﬁle accounts hasthe eﬀect of entitling the appellant to an order of revocation. Under the will the testator intended that Anil NathBasu should function as the managing executor during his lifetime, as will appear from the relevant portion ofparagraph 17 of the will which is as follows:.liofinda.org/in/cs/cen/INS C/15/28. h/02095956957i95wwwiiase95tml89 9/12/2ANIL BEHARI GHOSH V. SMT . LATIKA BALA DASSI & ORS [15] INSC 28; AIR 15 SC 56; 15 (2) SCR 20 ( 15 Ap rl 15)""I direct that my executor Babu Anil Nath Basu shall act alone without interference of my other executors indrawing money from or depositing money to any bank, courts or any other place or places and also in drawinginterest of Government Promissory Note, debentures, etc. and in collecting rents of the houses and also indefending and instituting all suits relating to my estate and for the purpose above to sign cheques, rent bills and allpapers relating to any suit in connection with my estate"".It would thus appear that Anil Nath Basu was not only the most competent man being a trained lawyer toadminister the estate but had also been in terms vested with the power to handle the cash and the accounts byhimself without interference by the other executors. He must therefore have handled the incomings and theoutgoings and been responsible for keeping true and proper accounts. Whether or not he did so we do not know,because Girish, as already indicated, never made any attempt to question the will or the grant or to call him toaccount. We have already made reference to Debi Prosad Mitter's correspondence with Anil Nath Basu, themanaging executor, bearing on the question of accounts.There is nothing on the record to show what happened on that demand for accounts by Debi Prosad Mitter. Themanaging executor was alive up till July 1948 and unfortunately for the appellant, he initiated the revocationproceedings more than a year after his death. If these proceedings had been started in Anil Nath Basu's lifetime,he would have been the best person 289 to inform the court as to how matters stood with reference to theaccounts. The fact remains that no accounts appear from the record of this case to have been submitted by theexecutors. An application was made before us to take notice of the fact that accounts had been submitted up todate by the 1st respondent who is in charge of the testator's estate. But whether or not the respondent has ﬁledaccounts during the pendency of this appeal is wholly irrelevant. We have to determine whether the omission tosubmit accounts in the circumstances of this case entitles the appellant to have an order of revocation. In the ﬁrstplace, no proper pleading had been made on this part of the case. It has not been alleged that there has been awilful default without any reason, able cause. Hence no proper foundation was laid in the pleadings for receptionof evidence either way. On that ground alone, in our opinion, the appellant must fail on this part of the case. It mayalso be pointed out that in all the circumstances of this case referred to above, particularly in view of the fact thatit was never suggested that the will in question was not genuine or had not been validly executed, it must be heldthat the proceedings leading up to this appeal have been misconceived. If the appellant has any locus standi, hisremedy lay not against the will or against the grant of probate, but under the will. But it is not for this court toadvise what the appellant should have done.As, in our opinion, all the grounds raised on behalf of the appellant for revoking the grant have failed, it is notnecessary to go into the question whether Girish had acquiesced in the grant in question and had therefore barredthe door against the appellant from raising any further questions about it.For the reasons aforesaid we uphold the decision of the court below and dismiss the appeal with costs to thecontesting respondent No. 1. There will be no order as to costs in respect of the other respondent."

No. 230 of 1949.Mahabir Prasad, Advocate-General for the State of Bihar (R.J. Bahadur and S. P. Varma, with him'), for the appellant.C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General for India (Porus A.Mehta and P.O. Gokhale, with him), for the respondent.1955. April 18. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal by the assesseeon leave granted under section 66-A of the Indian Income-Tax Act.The assessee by name Chatturam Horilram Ltd., who is the appellant before us, is a private limited companycarrying on in Chota Nagpur the business of exporting mica for sale to foreign countries. The assessment inquestion is for the year 1939-40 and the accounting year is the calendar year 1938. These proceedings wereinitiated on a notice issued to the assessee under section 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, (Act XI of 1922)(hereinafter referred to as the Act). It is the applicability of this section to the facts of this case that is the solematter for consideration in this appeal. The circumstances under which the above mentioned notice under section34 was issued are as follows.The appellant had previously been assessed to tax on an income of Rs. 1,09,200 for the same year 1939-40. by anorder dated the 22nd December, 1939, which was reduced on appeal by Rs. 31,315. That assessment was set asideby the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal on the 28th March, 1942, on the ground that the Indian Finance Act of 1939was not in force during 292 the assessment year 1939-40 in Chota Nagpur, which was a partially-excluded area. Ona reference by the Tribunal at the instance of the Income-tax authorities, the High Court of Patna agreed with thisview and pronounced on the 30th September, 1943, its judgment conﬁrming the setting aside of the assessment.Meanwhile, the Governor of Bihar promulgated Bihar Regulation IV of 1942, Which was assented to by theGovernor-General on the 30th June, 1942. By this Regulation, the Indian Finance Act of 1939 (along with FinanceActs of other years with which we are not concerned) was brought into force in Chota Nagpur retrospectively asfrom the 30th March 1939. The relevant portion of the Regulation was in the following terms.""The Indian Finance Act, 1939, shall be deemed to have come into force in the area to which this Regulationextends on the 30th day of March, 1939"". On the 8th February, 1944, the Income-tax Oﬃcer passed an order asfollows:""Due to recent judgment of the High Court the assessment under section 23(3) stands cancelled and with it thenotice under section 34 issued in this case becomes ineﬀective and is withdrawn. Assessee derives income frommica mining and dealing, moneylending, mining rents and non-agricultural sources of zamindary, and this hasescaped assessment in its entirety. Issue notice under section 22(2) read with section 34 again to ﬁle a return ofincome in the prescribed form and within the prescribed time, and inform the assessee that the original noticeunder section 34 has been cancelled"".It may be mentioned, in passing, that the notice under section 34 which is referred to in the above order as havingbecome ineﬀective and as, therefore, withdrawn was a prior one which was issued on the 8th July, 1941, i.e.,during the pendency of the assessee's appeal relating to the earlier assessment before the Income-tax AppellateTribunal. It is not quite clear from the record in what circumstances 'that notice came to be issued. But it looksprobable that it relates to certain items appearing in the accounts as 293 cash-credits to the tune of four lakhswhich, as will appear presently, were treated in the later proceedings as concealed income in the absence of anyproper explanation by the assessee. This prior notice under section 34, having been withdrawn, has no bearing onthe question at issue before us in this appeal and has not been relied on by either side. In pursuance of the orderdated the 8th February, 1944, quoted above, a fresh notice under section 34 of the Act was issued to the appellanton the, 12th February, 1944. The income of the assessee-company was thereupon determined at a sum of Rs.4,86,351, which on appeal to the Assistant Commissioner, was reduced by Rs.11,187. Out of this amount a sum of Rs. 4,04,618 related to two items of cash-credits appearing in the name of thepartners of the Company which in the absence of any satisfactory explanation, was treated by the Income-taxwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 30.html/02095959526 9/12/2MESSRS CHATTURAM HORILRAM LTD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, BIHAR AND ORISSA [15] INSC 30; AIR 15 …authorities as secreted proﬁts of the Company. Before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal two points were raised.(1) Whether the notice dated the 12th February, 1944, under section 34 of the Act was validly-issued. (2) Whetherthe Income tax authorities were right in holding that the cash- credit items were secret proﬁts. Both the pointswere decided against the assessee. On the assessee's application to refer both the points for the decision of theHigh Court, the Tribunal declined to make a reference as regards the second point but referred the ﬁrst for theopinion of the Court in the following terms:""Whether in the circumstances of the case, the notice issued on 12-2-1944 under section 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act was validly issued for the assessment year 1939-40?"" The question was answered against the assessee bythe High Court and hence this appeal before us. The assessee attempted to reopen the second question relating tosecret proﬁts before the High Court but the learned Judges declined to allow it to be canvassed, since the Tribunaldid not refer the question to them. We are, therefore, concerned in this appeal only with the question relating tothe validity of the notice 294 issued on the 12th February, 1944, under section 34 of the Act. It is obvious that if thisnotice is found to be invalid the assessee would get relief for the entire amount including the amount of secretproﬁts.The answer to the question which arises for consideration in this appeal depends on a correct appreciation of therequirements of section 34 of the Act. Now, it has to be mentioned that section 34 of the Act as it originally stoodin the Act of 1922, was amended by Act VII of 1939 and this was in turn amended by Act XLVIII of 1948. At therelevant date, i.e., for the assessment year 1939-40, section 34 (1) as amended by Act VII of 1939 (and before itsamendment in 1948) was in force. It was as follows:""If in consequence of deﬁnite information which has come into his possession the Income-tax Oﬃcer discoversthat income, proﬁts or gains chargeable to income-tax have escaped assessment in any year, (or have been under-assessed, or have been assessed at too low a rate, or have been the subject of excessive relief under this Act) theIncome-tax Oﬃcer may, (in any case in which be has reason to believe that the assessee has concealed theparticulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars thereof, at any time within eight yearsand) in any other case at any time within four years of the end,of that year, serve on the person liable to pay tax onsuch income, proﬁts or gains, or, in the case of a company, on the principal oﬃcer thereof, a notice containing allor any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub-section (2) of section 22, and may proceedto assess or re-assess such income, proﬁts or gains and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, applyaccordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub-section"".Omitting from the above sub-section those portions which are inapplicable to the facts of the present case -marked out within brackets-it may be seen that the facts which require to be established for the validity of thenotice under this sub-section are (I' the income, proﬁts or gains sought to be assessed should be chargeable toincome-tax and have escaped assess- 295 ment in any year, and (2) the Income-tax Oﬃcer should have discoveredit in consequence of deﬁnite information which has come into his possession. The contention of the learnedcounsel for the appellant is that, with reference to the facts of this case, none of these conditions can be said tohave been satisﬁed. It is urged that the income sought to be assessed under these proceedings was not, as a fact,chargeable to income-tax during the assessment year 1939-40.It is said that in any case there can be no question of the income having escaped assessment because, as a fact, theincome-tax authorities did proceed to assess the income and that what happened is that the proceedings becameinfructuous by reason of the High Court having pronounced them to be void. It is also contended that there is noquestion of discovery of any relevant fact or information, because the non-assessment of the income of theassessee for the period in question was in spite of all the information relating to the income of the assessee havingbeen previously furnished and being in the possession of the Income-tax Oﬃcer as would appear from the order ofthe Oﬃcer dated the 22nd December, 1939. It is convenient to deal with this last objection in the ﬁrst instance.It may be true that all the information relating to the relevant income of the assessee which is now sought to betaxed was in the possession of the Income-tax Oﬃcer in the year 1939 itself when the return was submitted incompliance with the notice under section 22(2) of the Act then issued.But what was required under section 34(1) was not merely fresh information as to the income that escapedassessment but information as to the fact of escapement from assessment of the chargeable income. In thepresent case the income- tax authorities proceeded to assess the appellant in the normal way during theassessment year 1939-40 itself. Those proceedings became infructuous, by virtue of the decision of the Income-taxAppellate Tribunal and the decision of the High Court conﬁrming it, which disclosed that the Indian Finance Act ofwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 30.html/02095959536 9/12/2MESSRS CHATTURAM HORILRAM LTD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, BIHAR AND ORISSA [15] INSC 30; AIR 15 …1939 was not in operation in 296 the relevant area at the relevant period and that in the absence thereof no validassessment could be made. The fact, therefore, that the income of the appellant for the relevant year remainedwithout any valid assessment emerged only on the High Court ﬁnally giving its decision that the assessmentproceedings previously taken were invalid. If, in the circumstances, there was ""escapement of chargeable incomefrom assessment""-a question to be dealt with presently-there can be no doubt that this fact can be reasonably saidto have been discovered by the Income-tax Oﬃcer only when he got deﬁnite information as to (1) the passing ofthe Bihar Regulation IV of 1942 applying the Indian Finance Act of 1939 retrospectively for the relevant accountingperiod, and (2) the judgment of the High Court pronouncing prior proceedings to be invalid It is knowledge of boththese facts, together, that would, with reference to the circumstances of the present case, constitute the discoveryof the relevant fact in consequence of deﬁnite information received by the Income-tax Oﬃcer. The information asto both these facts taken together could only be after the decision of the High Court on the 30th September, 1943.As already stated, the notice under section 34(1) , whose validity is in question, was based on the order of theIncome-tax Oﬃcer dated the 8th February, 1944, after the judgment of the High Court was pronounced.That order which has been extracted above, shows clearly that it was in consequence of the judgment of the HighCourt in the back-ground of the promulgation of Regulation IV of 1942 that fresh action under section 34 (1) -wasbeing initiated.A number of cases (C.I. T. Bombay v. Sir Mahomed Yusuf Ismail(1); Fazal Dhala v. C.I. T., B.& 0. Raghavalu Naidu &Sons v. C.I. T., Madras(3); and Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy v. C. I. T., West Bengal(,) have been cited before us toshow how the phrase ""deﬁnite information"" and the word ""discovery"" used in this section have been interpreted bythe various (1) [ 1944] 12 I.T.R. S.(3) [ 1915] 13 I.T.R. 194.(2) [ 1944] 12 I.T.R. 341.(4) [ 1953] 24 I.T.R. 70.297 High Courts. It is unnecessary to deal with these cases at any length. There is here no question as to any newsubjective facts such as change of opinion consequent on a correct appreciation of law by the very same, oranother, or higher oﬃcer, that is pressed into service as bringing about ""deﬁnite information "" and ""discovery"". Weare quite clear that the promulgation of the Regulation and the decision of the High Court are objective facts,information regarding which became available to the Income-tax Oﬃcer when he passed the order dated the 8thFebruary, 1944, and it is only when these facts came to his knowledge, that the Income-tax Oﬃcer can be said tohave discovered that chargeable income escaped assessment in the relevant year.The main question that requires consideration in this case is whether, on the facts, it can be said that ""incomechargeable to income-tax has escaped assessment in the relevant year"". The contention of the learned counsel forthe appellant is that during the relevant year 1939-40 the income was not chargeable to tax as a fact and that theretrospective operation of the Finance Act for the relevant year by virtue of a later legislation does not make adiﬀerence for this purpose. To decide this question it is necessary to have a clear idea of the scheme of the Income-tax Act and its correlation to the Finance Act of each year.The Income-tax Act is a standing piece of legislation which provides the entire machinery for the levy of income-tax.The Finance Act of each year imposes the obligation for the payment of a determinate sum for each such yearcalculated with reference to that machinery. As has been pointed out by the Federal Court in Chatturam v. C.I. T.,Bihar(1) (quoting from the judgment of Lord Dunedin in Whitney v.Commissioners of Inland Revenue (2). ""there are three stages in the imposition of a tax. There is the declaration ofliability, that is the part of the statute which deter- mines what persons in respect of what property are (1) [ 1947]F.C.R. 116 at 126.(2) [ 1926] A.C. 37.38 298 liable. Next, there is the assessment. Liability does not depend on assessment. That, ex hypothesi, hasalready been ﬁxed. But assessment particularises the exact sum which a person liable has to pay. Lastly, come themethods of recovery if the person taxed does not voluntarily pay"". The same idea has been expressed in slightlywww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 30.html/02095959546 9/12/2MESSRS CHATTURAM HORILRAM LTD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, BIHAR AND ORISSA [15] INSC 30; AIR 15 …diﬀerent language by Lord Romer in the judgment of the Privy Council reported in C.I.T., Bombay & Aden v.Khemchand Ramdas(1). Chapter III of the Income-tax Act headed ""Taxable Income"" contains the various provisionswith reference to which taxable income is determined. The tax is leviable under section 3 and is in respect of thetotal income of an assessee in the previous year. The total income is deﬁned in section 2, sub-section (15). Theapplication of the Act to the total income in the hands of an assessee is governed by sections 4, 4-A and 4-B and isdetermined with reference to concepts relating to residence, receipt and accrual, as indicated therein. Section 3,under which the actual charge of income-tax arises, is as follows:""Where any Central Act enacts that income-tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates, tax at that rate orthose rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, this Act in respect ofthe total income of the previous year of every individual, Hindu undivided family, company and local authority, andof every ﬁrm and other association of persons or the partners of the ﬁrm or the members of the associationindividually"".It is by virtue of this section that the actual levy of the tax and the rates at which the tax has to be computed isdetermined each year by the annual Finance Acts. Thus, under the scheme of the Income-tax Act, the income ofan assessee attracts the quality of taxability with reference to the standing provisions of the Act but the payabilityand the quantiﬁcation of the tax depend on the passing and application of the annual Finance Act. Thus, income ischargeable to tax independent of the passing of the (1) [ 1938] 6 I.T.R. 414 at 428.299 Finance Act but until the Finance Act is passed no tax can be actually levied. A comparison of sections 3 and 6of the Act shows that the Act recognises the distinction between chargeability and the actual operation of thecharge.Section 6 says ""save as otherwise provided by this Act, the following heads of income, proﬁts and gains, shall bechargeable to income-tax in the manner hereinafter appearing, etc."" while section 3, as already quoted above, saysthat ""where any Central Act enacts that income-tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates, tax at thatrate or those rates,, shall be charged for that year, etc."" Though, no doubt, sections 3 and 4 are the chargingsections in the Act as pointed out in Chatturam v. C.I.T., Bihar(1) at page 125, the wording of section 3 assumes thepre-existence of chargeable income as indicated in section6. Hence, according to the scheme of the Act the quality of chargeability of any income is independent of thepassing of the Finance Act. In this view, therefore, though, as a fact, on account of the Finance Act not having beenextended to the relevant area during the year 1939-40, legal authority was then lacking for the quantiﬁcation ofthe tax and imposition of the liability therefor, the income of the assessee for the relevant year was nonethelesschargeable to tax at the time, in the sense explained above. Indeed, it can also be said that the very fact ofRegulation IV of 1942, having brought the Finance Act of 1939 into operation retrospectively, in this area, hasfactually brought about, in any case, the chargeability of the tax during that very year. The relevant portion of theRegulation says that ""the Indian Finance Act of 1939 shall be deemed to have come into force in the area to whichthis Regulation extends on the 30th day of March, 1939"". By virtue of this deeming provision the Indian Finance Actof 1939 must be assumed even factually to have come into operation on the date speciﬁed and the tax must betaken to have become chargeable in that very year, though the actual liability for payment could not arise untilproper and (1) [ 1947] F.C.R. 116.300 valid steps 'are taken for quantiﬁcation of the tax. The contention, therefore, of the appellant that the incomewas not chargeable to tax in the year 1939-40 cannot be accepted.The next question that arises is whether the income, though chargeable to tax in the year, can be said to haveescaped assessment in the relevant year. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is that sinceassessment proceedings had in fact been taken during the year 1939-40 by an order of assessment dated the 22ndDecember, 1939, it cannot be said that the income ""escaped"" assessment. He urges that what happened was that,in spite of assessment having been made, the assessment proceedings became infructuous on account of thedecision of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal setting aside the same and High Court agreeing with it. He contendsthat, in the circumstances, this is no more than a failure of the assessment proceedings but that it is not anescapement from assessment. He relied upon the Privy Council case in Sir Rajendranath Mukherjee v.C.I. P., Bengal(1), where their Lordships say that ""the expression 'has escaped assessment' cannot be read asequivalent to 'has not been assessed""' and that ""such a reading gives too narrow a meaning to the wordwww.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/15/ 30.html/02095959556 9/12/2MESSRS CHATTURAM HORILRAM LTD. V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, BIHAR AND ORISSA [15] INSC 30; AIR 15 …'assessment' and too wide a meaning to the word 'escaped""'. Learned counsel for the respondent relies on anumber of subsequent 'cases of the various High Courts (Madan Mohan Lal v.C.I.T., Punjab(1); C.I. T., Bombay v. Pirojbai N.Contractor(3); and Kunwar Bishwanath Singh v. C.I. T., C.P.(4) ) which have explained. this decision of the PrivyCouncil and pointed out that the particular passage in that judgment which is relied upon bad reference to the,facts of that case, viz., the proceedings by way of initial assessment being still pending. While no doubt the PrivyCouncil case is thus distinguishable, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the escapementfrom assessment is not to be equated to (1) [ 1934] 2 I.T R. 71 at 77.(3) [ 1937] 5 I.T.R. 338.(2) [ 1935] 3 I.T.R. 438.(4) [ 1942] 10 I.T.R. 322.301 non-assessment simpliciter is not without force. Here again, it is unnecessary to lay down what exactlyconstitutes ""escapement from assessment"". For the purpose of the present case it appears to us suﬃcient to saythat, where earlier assessment proceedings had in fact been taken but failed to result in a valid assessment owingto some lacuna other than that attributable to the assessing authorities, notwithstanding the chargeability ofincome to the tax, it would be a case of chargeable income escaping assessment and not a case of mere non-assessment of income- tax. The proceedings for assessment in the present case have failed to result in a validassessment by virtue of a legal lacuna, viz., the fact of the Indian Finance Act of 1939 not having been extended tothe relevant area for the relevant assessment year. Learned counsel for the appellant suggests that the failure ofthe assessment proceedings in this case must be taken to have been due to the lapse of the income-taxauthorities. It is said that inasmuch as Regulation IV of 1942 was actually passed during the pendency of thereference in the High Court in respect of the prior proceedings, the result would have been diﬀerent, if theRegulation had been brought to the notice of the High Court. There is, however, no reason to think so. The HighCourt's jurisdiction was only to answer the particular question that was referred to it by the Income-tax AppellateTribunal and it is extremely doubtful whether they could have taken notice of a subsequent legislation andanswered a diﬀerent question. Learned counsel for the appellant also urged that in any case the deeming provisionenacted in Regulation IV of 1942, may be taken to have validated the assessment proceedings previously taken inthe year 1939 and at best to have restored the assessment order passed by the Income-tax Oﬃcer on the 22ndDecember, 1939, and conﬁrmed by the Assistant Commissioner. But this overlooks the fact that the order had infact been set aside by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and that the setting aside was conﬁrmed by the HighCourt on the reference made to it. Admittedly the Regulation was passed after the decision of the 302 Income-taxAppellate Tribunal. Notwithstanding that the Regulation IV of 1942 purported to be retrospective) it cannot havethe eﬀect of eﬀacing the result brought about by the decision of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and the HighCourt on reference, unless there are clear and express words to that eﬀect. It might have been quite a diﬀerentmatter, if by the date of the Regulation the assessment pro- ceedings themselves were still pending as in facthappened with reference to assessment proceedings in this area, in respect of a number of assessees for thesubsequent assessment year, 1940-41, which were pending by the date of the relevant Regulation and werecontinued up to their termination. They were held to be valid both by the High Court and by the Federal Courtwhen challenged by the assessees. (See Raja Bahadur Kamakshya Narain Singh v.C.I.T., B. & O.(1); Chatturam v. C.I. T., B. & O.(1); as also Chatturam v. C.I.T., Bihar(1). It follows, therefore, that, inour view, the income of the assessee 'Chargeable to income-tax escaped assessment in the relevant year 1939-40.The High Court was, therefore, right in answering as it did the question referred to it.The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.(1) (1946) 14 I.T R.

D.No. 9 of 1953 published in the Fort St. George Gazette, dated the 8th July, 1953 being G. 0. Ms. No. 3024/53 to apayment of nearly Rs. 7,00,000 out of which the workers belonging to the Madras Tramways Workers Associationalone would be entitled nearly to a sum of Rs. 4,35,000 and are thus the major creditors of the Company. TheCompany was incorporated in England with its principal oﬃce situated at No. 1, Rundalls Road, Vepery, Madras-7and was running the Tramway Service in Madras with licence issued to it by the Government under the TramwaysAct. It had issued 377 1300 First Debentures of CIOO each and the debenture-holders had appointed the BeawerTrust Ltd., England as trustees.By an Indenture made in England on the 13th October 1924 the Company charged by way of ﬁrst charge in favourof the trustees all its undertaking properties and assets for the time being both present and future including itsuncalled capital with the payment of all moneys for the time being owing on the security of the debentures andsuch charge was to rank as a ﬂoating charge. By two subsequent deeds made at Madras dated the 26th March,1925 and 6th July, 1950 certain immovable properties belonging to the company were mortgaged in favour of thesaid trustees. The said Trustees appointed Respondent 2, the Managing Director of the Company and day to daymanagement of the Tramway Service and of the business of the Compay, as their Receiver. He took possession assuch Receiver,, from the midnight of 11th April, 1953 of all the assets of the Company including moneys in the bankto the credit of the Company and after that date the Tramways Service was suspended and still remainssuspended..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/31.h/02095950957wwwiiofindirasee95tml28 9/12/2M.

No. 419 of 1953 as the duly constitutedAttorney of the Company for winding up the Company on the ground that it was unable to pay its debts and that itbad ceased to carry on its business. An order for the winding up of the Company was made by the Court on the20th January, 1954 and the Oﬃcial Receiver, High Court, Madras, was appointed the Oﬃcial Liquidator. Since allthe assets including the moneys of the Company were in possession of Respondent 2, the Oﬃcial Receiver wasunable to take charge of anything except the records of the Company.Soon after the order for winding up the Respondent 2 advertised in the newspapers on the 23rd January, 1954 forthe sale of the properties and assets of the Company. At the end of the conditions of sale he stated in paragraph 7that ""the sales are for the time being subject to the approval of the High Court 378 at Madras and it will be for theundersigned to obtain such approval for accepted oﬀers free of all costs to the purchaser"".At the time of the order of winding up, two suits were pending in the High Court, C.S. No. 191 of 1952 ﬁled by theCompany against the State of Madras for Rs. 1,33,204-9-0 and interest thereon being electric charges alleged tohave been collected by the State of Madras in excess of those payable by the Company and paid by the companyunder protest and C.S. No. 368 of 1953 ﬁled by the State of Madras against the Company for the recovery of Rs.9,26,123-2-3 with interest thereon, being the diﬀerence alleged to be due in respect of the electric charges underthe old rates and the revised rates applicable to the Company. During the pendency of the said suits Respondent 2gave an undertaking in Application No. 4533 of 1953 in Civil Suit No. 368 of 1953 that he would not without theorders of the High Court dispose of any of the assets of the Company which were in his possession till the disposalof the suit C.S. No. 368 of 1953. The two suits aforesaid were tried together and were disposed of by a commonjudgment on the 16th March 1954.On the 16th July 1954 Respondent 2 agreed to sell and Respondent 3 agreed to buy the movable properties of theCompany the particulars of which were set out in the agreement entered into on that date, for a price of Rs.4,01,658 of which half was paid on the signing of the agreement and the other half was agreed to be paid out ofthe proceeds of sale to be made by the purchasers of the assets as scrap.On the 23rd July 1954 the Oﬃcial Receiver, High Court, Madras (Respondent 5 herein) ﬁled an application No. 3542of 1954 for setting aside the said sale of the assets of the Company on the grounds, inter alia, that it was prejudicialto the interests of the General body of unsecured creditors, that the same had been concluded with undue hasteand without adequate publicity and in violation of Respondent 2's said undertaking to the Court. It also asked foran injunction restraining the Respondent 2 from 379 handing over and the Respondent 3 from either taking over orbreaking up the assets purchased by him pending, the disposal of the said application.This application was based on a report of the Oﬃcial Receiver in which after setting out the relevant facts hesubmitted that even though under section 229 of the Indian Companies Act the Company which was admittedlyinsolvent was governed by rules prevailing with regard to the respective rights of the secured and unsecuredcreditors and to debts provable and valuation of annuities governing the administration in insolvency and securedcreditors generally stood outside the liquidation and were entitled to have the remedy of realising the security andproving before him for the deﬁciency, if the properties of the Company could be sold for a price higher than theamount due to the Trustees of the debenture holders there was a possibility of a surplus coming into his bands forthe beneﬁt of the unsecured creditors. If the Respondent 2 proved before him for any deﬁciency due to thesecured creditors, it would certainly aﬀect the rights of unsecured creditors, and moreover though the securedcreditors might realise the security, it will be in the interests of the unsecured creditors to see that a fair and properprice was obtained.He therefore submitted that in the interests of the unsecured creditors it was just and necessary to have a fairvaluation ascertained and an enquiry held to ascertain whether the sale by the Respondent 2 in favour ofRespondent 3 was bona ﬁde and for a proper price. Respondent 2 ﬁled an aﬃdavit in reply in August 1954contending inter alia, (1) that the oﬀer by the Respondent 3 was the highest, that he had received and that this hadbeen accepted bona ﬁde, (2) that in the advertisement the condition as to the previous sanction of the Court wasinserted because of the undertaking that be had given to the Court in C.S. No. 368 of 1953 and that thisundertaking lapsed with the dismissal of the said suit on the 16th March 1954, (3) that he had been advised by theSolicitors in England for the debenture trustees that it was unnecessary for him to obtain 380 the sanction of theCourt and that he had been instructed not to apply for such sanction and (4) that the sale was bona ﬁde and he hadsecured as good a price as could be obtained..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/31.h/02095950957wwwiiofindirasee95tml38 9/12/2M.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS & ORS [15] INSC 31; AIR 15 SC 64; 15 (2) SCR 34 (20 A…By its judgment and order dated the 9th August 1954 Mr.Justice Balakrishna Ayyar (in Chambers) dismissed the said application with costs. The learned Judge held that thequestion whether Respondent 2 had violated the undertaking given by him was not germane to the applicationbefore him, that undoubtedly the Respondent 2 did give wide publicity of his intention to sell the assets of theCompany, that it could not be said that the sale was sub rosa on the ground of want of wide publicity to theintended sale of the Company's assets and that the Respondent 3's oﬀer was the best oﬀer received by theRespondent 2 looking both to the abstract of oﬀers appended to the aﬃdavit of the Respondent 2 in the saidapplication, and looking to the other oﬀers pointed out to him by Respondent 5. The learned Judge furtherreferred to the oﬀer of the Corporation of Madras and said that the said Corporation had not made any ﬁrm oﬀerat all and that the oﬀer of one A. Chettiar of Rs. 4,25,000 made on 5th August 1954 during the hearing of theapplication was an oﬀer made by a person who did not appear to him to be of a man of sound ﬁnancial status. Thelearned Judge in his judgment also recorded the fact that during the hearing of the application the Respondent 3oﬀered to sell to the Madras Municipal Corporation the entire assets he had purchased at the same price which hepaid for it but the Corporation were not prepared to accept the oﬀer.The Respondent 5 accepted the said judgment and decision and did not prefer any appeal against the same. Butthe Appellants who were not parties to the proceedings applied for and obtained from the High Court leave toappeal from the said decision. This appeal also was dismissed by the High Court with costs on the 24th September1954. The High Court diﬀered from the ﬁnding of the Trial Court and held that due publicity had not been given tothe 381 intended sale and observed that if the matter rested merely on a decision of that point they would haveallowed the appeal and set aside the sale. They how-' ever held that in the absence of fraud or want of bona ﬁdeson the part of the seller along with that of the buyer the sale in favour of the Respondent 3 could not be set aside.The High Court further considered the question whether the said sale was void as being without the leave of theCourt in view of section 232 of the Indian Companies Act and answered that question in the negative. The HighCourt further held that a secured creditor had a right to realise his security without seeking the assistance of thecourt and remaining outside the winding up.Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree of the High Court the Appellants applied for leave to appeal tothis Court and such leave was granted by the High Court on the 24th September 1954.The bona ﬁdes of the Respondent 2 in the matter of the sale were not challenged either in the Courts below orbefore us and there were concurrent ﬁndings of fact that the price obtained by Respondent 2 was the best priceavailable under the circumstances. It was however urged by the learned Solicitor-General for the Appellants:-(I)that the High Court, having found that due publicity had not been given to the intended sale, ought not to haveallowed the Respondent 3 at that stage to raise the question as to whether the Court had any power or jurisdictionto set aside the sale except on the ground that it was vitiated by fraud or for want of bona ﬁdes and (2) that thesale- by Respondent 2 being a sale held without leave of the winding up Court was void under section 232(1) of theIndian Companies Act. The High Court bad allowed the Respondent 3 to raise the question even at that late stageinasmuch as it was a pure question of law and the learned Solicitor-General therefore rightly did not press the ﬁrstcontention before us. The main argument centered round the second contention, viz., whether the sale eﬀectedby the Respondent 2 without leave of - the winding up Court was void and hence liable to be set aside.382 The decision of this question turns upon the true construction of section 232 of the Indian Companies 'Act,which runs as under:- ""(I) Where any company is being wound up by or subject to the supervision of the Court, anyattachment, distress or execution put in force without leave of the Court against the estate or eﬀects or any saleheld without leave of the Court of any of the properties of the company after the commencement of the windingup shall be void.(2) Nothing in this section applies to proceedings by the Government"".It may be noted that the words ""or any sale held without leave of the Court of any of the properties"" underlinedabove were inserted by Act XXII of 1936. Before this amendment section 232(1) was almost in identical terms withsection 228(1) of the English Companies Act of 1948.Two other sections of the Indian Companies Act may be noted in this context, viz. section 171:""When a winding uporder has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed no suit or other legal proceeding shall beproceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the Court, and subject to such terms as theCourt may impose."" and Section 229:- ""In the winding up of an insolvent company the same rules shall prevail and.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/31.h/02095950957wwwiiofindirasee95tml48 9/12/2M.

Cork(1):""The phrase 'outside the winding up' is an intelligible phrase if used, as it often is, with reference to a securedcreditor, say a mortgagee. The mortgagee of a company in liquidation is in a position to say ""the mortgagedproperty is to the extent of the mortgage my property. It is immaterial to me whether my mortgage is in windingup or not. I remain outside the winding up' and shall enforce my rights as mortgagee"". This is to be contrasted withthe case in which such a creditor prefers to assert his right, not as a mortgagee, but as a creditor. He may say 'I willprove in respect of my debt'. If so, he comes into the winding up"".It is also summarised in Palmer's Company Precedents Vol.II, page 415:""Sometimes the mortgagee sells, with or without the concurrence of the liquidator, in exercise of a power of salevested in him by the mortgage. It is not necessary to obtain liberty to exercise the power of sale, although ordersgiving such liberty have sometimes been made"".The secured creditor is thus outside the winding up and can realise his security without the leave of the winding upCourt, though if he ﬁles a suit or takes other legal proceedings for the realisation of his security he is bound undersection 231 (corresponding with section 171 of the Indian Companies Act) to obtain the leave of, the winding upCourt before he can do so although such leave would almost automatically be granted. Section 231 has been readtogether with section 228(1) and the attachment, sequestration, distress or execution referred to in the latter havereference to proceedings taken through the Court and if the creditor has resort to those proceedings he cannot putthem in force against the estate or eﬀects of the Company after the commencement of the winding up withoutthe leave of the winding up Court. The (1) 1923 Appeal Cases 647.49 384 provisions in section 317 are also supplementary to the provisions of section 231 and emphasise the positionof the secured creditor as one outside the winding up, the secured creditor being, in regard to the exercise of thoserights and privileges, in the same position as he would be under the Bankruptcy Act.The corresponding provisions of the Indian Companies Act have been almost bodily incorporated from those ofthe English Companies Act and if there was nothing more, the position of the secured creditor here also would bethe same as that obtaining in England and he would also be outside the winding up and a sale by him without theintervention of the Court would be valid and could not be challenged as void under section 232(1) of the IndianCompanies Act.It was however urged that the addition of the words ""or any sale held without leave of the Court of any of theproperties"" had changed the position of the secured creditor and even though the secured creditor realised thesecurity without the intervention of the Court such sale, if eﬀected by him without the leave of the winding upCourt, was void.It was pointed out that these words did not ﬁnd their place in the corresponding section 228(1) of the EnglishCompanies Act and therefore even though any attachment, distress or execution put in force without leave of theCourt against the estate or eﬀects of the company after the commencement of the winding up was void under theterms of the section 232(1) as it originally stood, the words ""or any sale held without leave of the Court of any ofthe properties"" of the company were wide enough to include not only a sale held through the intervention of theCourt but also a sale eﬀected by the secured creditor without the intervention of the Court whether the sale wasby private treaty or by public auction. It was contended on the other hand on behalf of the contesting Respondent,Respondent 3, that the amendment was made in order to get over the decision of the Allahabad High Court inKayastha Trading and Banking Corporation Ltd. v..la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/31.h/02095950957wwwiiofindirasee95tml58 9/12/2M.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS & ORS [15] INSC 31; AIR 15 SC 64; 15 (2) SCR 34 (20 A…385 Sat Narain Singh(1) and that in any event on a true construction of section 232(1) as amended the words ""anysale held"" had reference in the context only to sales held by or eﬀected through the intervention of the Court andnot sales eﬀected by the secured creditor without the intervention of the Court.The decision of the Allahabad High Court above referred to had held on a construction of section 232(1) as it thenstood, that an execution was not put in force merely when the property of the judgment debtor was sold inpursuance thereof, but it was put in force when the property was attached and hence where the property of aninsolvent company was attached prior to the date of the commencement of the winding up but was actually soldsubsequent to such date, the sale was not void and could be upheld. There was an earlier decision of the PatnaHigh Court in Baldeo Narain Singh v. The, United India Bank Ltd.(1) in which a contrary decision had been reachedexactly under similar circumstances. It is well-known that this conﬂict was resolved and the decision of theAllahabad High Court was got over by inserting this amendment by Act XXII of 1936.The statement of objects and reasons is certainly not admissible as an aid to the construction of a statute. But itcan be referred to for the limited purpose of ascertaining the conditions prevailing at the time which actuated thesponsor of the Bill to introduce the same and the extent and urgency of the evil which he sought to remedy. Stateof West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal Bose and Others(3). The amendment of section 232(1) inserted by Act XXII of 1936was designed to prevent such sales as were upheld by the decision of the Allahabad High Court in KayasthaTrading and Banking Corporation Ltd. v. Sat Narain Singh(1) and it would be permissible to refer to that portion ofthe statement of objects and reasons for the purpose of ascertaining the extent and urgency of the evil which wassought to be remedied by introducing the amendment. It follows therefore that the (1) [ 1921] I.L.R. 43 Allahabad433 (2) [ 1915] 38 Indian Cases 91.(3) [ 1953] INSC 85; [ 1954] S.C.R. 587, 628.386 amendment could not have been intended to bring within the sweep of the general words ""or any sale heldwithout the leave of the Court of any of the properties"" sales eﬀected by the secured creditor outside the windingup.Even apart from this intendment there are certain canons of construction which also tend to support the sameconclusion.Prior to the amendment the law was well-settled both in England and in India that the secured creditor wasoutside the winding up and he could realise his security without the intervention of the Court by eﬀecting a sale ofthe mortgaged premises by private treaty or by public auction.It was only when the intervention of the Court was sought either by putting in force any attachment, distress orexecution within the meaning of section 232(1) as it stood before the amendment or proceeding with orcommencing a suit or other legal proceedings against the company within the meaning of section 171 that leave ofthe Court was necessary and if no such leave was obtained the remedy could not be availed of by the securedcreditor. The sale of the mortgaged premises was also brought by the amendment on a par with the attachment,distress or execution put in force at the instance of the secured creditor and having regard to the context such salecould only be construed to be a sale held through the intervention of the Court and not one eﬀected by thesecured creditor outside the winding up and without the intervention of the Court.It is a well-recognised rule of construction that ""when two or more words which are susceptible of analogousmeaning are coupled together noscunter a sociis, they are understood to be used in their cognate sense. Theytake, as it were, their colour from each other., that is., the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to theless general.(Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Tenth Edition, p.332). The Judicial Committee of the Privy - Council also expressed itself in similar terms in Angus Robertson &Others v. George Day(1):- (1) [ 1879] L.R. 5 A.C. 63, 69.387 ""It is a legitimate rule of construction to construe words in an Act of Parliament with reference to words foundin immediate connection with them"".Having regard therefore to the context in which these words ""any sale held without leave of the Court of any of theproperties"" have been used in juxtaposition with ""any attachment, distress or execution put into force without.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/31.h/02095950957wwwiiofindirasee95tml68 9/12/2M.

In allgeneral matters outside those limits the law remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable that thelegislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law,without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness.......................... This passage from Maxwell wasapproved of by Their Lordships of the Privy Council in Murugian, P. v. Jainudeen, C. L.(1) and Their Lordshipsagreed that the law was correctly stated in the passage just cited. To the same eﬀect are also the observations ofthe Court of Appeal in National Assistance Board v. Wilkinson(1) where it was held that the Statute is not to betaken as aﬀecting a fundamental alteration in the general law unless it uses words pointing unmistakably to thatconclusion. In that case at page 658 Lord Goddard, C.J. observed:- (1) [ 1954] 3 Weekly Law Reports 682, 687, (2)[ 1952] 2 Q.B. 648 388 ""But it may be presumed that the legislature does not intend to make a substantialalteration in the law beyond what it expressly declares. In Minet v. Leman(1), Sir John Romilly, M. R. stated as aprinciple of construction which could not be disputed that 'the general words of the Act are not to be so construedas to alter the previous policy of the law, unless no sense or meaning can be applied to those words consistentlywith the intention of preserving the existing policy untouched' "".If the construction sought to be put upon the words ""or any sale held without leave of the Court of any of theproperties"" by the Appellants were accepted it would eﬀect a fundamental alteration in the law as it stood beforethe amendment was inserted in section 232(1) by Act XXII of 1936. Whereas before the amendment the securedcreditor stood outside the winding up and could if the mortgage deed so provided, realise his security without theintervention of the Court by eﬀecting a sale either by private treaty or by public auction, no such sale could beeﬀected by him after the amendment and that was certainly a fundamental alteration in the law which could notbe eﬀected unless one found words used which pointed unmistakably to that conclusion or unless such intentionwas expressed with irresistible clearness. Having regard to the circumstances under which the amendment wasinserted in section 232(1) by Act XXII of 1936 and also having regard to the context we are not prepared to holdthat the Legislature in inserting that amendment intended to eﬀect a fundamental alteration in law withirresistible clearness. Such a great and sudden change of policy could not be attributed to the Legislature and itwould be legitimate therefore to adopt the narrower interpretation of those words of the amendment rather thanan interpretation which would have the contrary eﬀect.(Vide the observations of the Privy Council in Vasudeva Mudaliar & Others v. Srinivasa Pillai & another(1).(1) [ 1855] EngR 324; [ 1855] 20 Beav. 269.(2) (19O7) I.L.R. 30 Madras 426, 433, 389 It may be observed in this connection that section 171 enacts a generalprovision with regard to suits or other legal proceedings to be proceeded with or commenced against thecompany after a winding up order has been made and lays down that no suit or other legal proceedings shall beproceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as theCourt may impose. This general provision is supplemented by the supplemental provisions to be foundrespectively in sections 229 and 232(1) of the Act. Section 229 speaks of the application of insolvency rules inwinding up of insolvent companies and section 232(1) speaks of the avoidance of certain attachments, executions,etc., put into force without the leave of the Court against the estate and eﬀects of the company and also of anysale held without the leave of the Court of any of the properties of the company after the commencement of thewinding up. Section 229 recognises the position of the secured creditor generally as outside the winding up butenables him in the event of his desiring to take the beneﬁt of the winding up proceedings to prove his debt, tovalue the same and share in the distribution pro rata of the assets of the company just in the same way as hewould be able to do in the case of insolvency under the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act or the ProvincialInsolvency Act. Section 232(1) also has reference to legal proceedings in much the same way as legal proceedingsenvisaged by section 171 of the Act and the attachment, distress or execution put in force or the sale held are all ofthem legal proceedings which can only be resorted to through the intervention of the Court. The word ""held"" inconnection with the sales contemplated within the terms of the amended section also lends support to thisconclusion and this conclusion is further fortiﬁed by the terms of section 232(2) which says that nothing in this.la.og/in/cs/cn/INSC/15/31.h/02095950957wwwiiofindirasee95tml78 9/12/2M.

GOVERNMENT OF MADRAS & ORS [15] INSC 31; AIR 15 SC 64; 15 (2) SCR 34 (20 A…section applies to proceedings by the Government, thus in eﬀect indicating that what are referred to in section232(1) are proceedings within the meaning of that term as used in section 171 of the Act.390 The Federal Court also put a similar construction on the provisions of section 171 read with section 232(1) ofthe Act in The Governor-General in Council v. Shiromani Sugar Mills Ltd. (In Liquidation)(1) ""Section 171 must, inour judgment, be construed with reference to other sections of the Act and the general scheme of administrationof the assets of a company in liquidation laid down by the Act. In particular, we would refer to section 232. Section232 appears to us to be supplementary to section 171 by providing that any creditor (other than Government) whogoes ahead, notwithstanding a winding-up order or in ignorance of it, with any attachment, distress, execution orsale, without the previous leave of the Court, will ﬁnd that such steps are void. The ref- erence to ""distress""indicates that leave of the Court is required for more than the initiation of original proceedings in the nature of asuit in an ordinary Court of law. Moreover, the scheme of the application of the company's property in the paripassu satisfaction of its liabilities, envisaged in section 211 and other sections of the Act, cannot be made to workin co-ordination, unless all creditors (except such secured creditors as are ""outside the winding-up"" in the senseindicated by Lord Wrenbury in his speech in Food Controller V. Cork(1) at page 671) are subjected as to theiractions against the property of the company to the control of the Court. Accordingly, in our judgment, no narrowconstruction should be placed upon the words ""or other legal proceeding"" in section 171. 'In our judgment, thewords can and should be held to cover distress and execution proceedings in the ordinary Courts. In our view, suchproceedings are other legal proceedings against the company, as contrasted with ordinary suits against thecompany"". We are therefore of the opinion that the sale eﬀected by Respondent 2 as the Receiver of the Trusteesof the debenture-holders on the 16th July 1954 was valid and binding on all parties concerned and could not bechallenged as it was sought to be done by the (1) [ 1946] F.C.R. 40, 55.(2) 1923 A.C. 647.391 Oﬃcial Receiver. The position was rightly summed up by the High Court as under:- ""We thus reach the positionthat no leave of Court was needed before the Receiver appointed by the mortgagee debenture-holders exercisedthe power of sale and that as there is no allegation of want of bona ﬁdes or recklessness or fraud against theReceiver in exercising such a power, it would follow that the sale held by the Receiver is valid and eﬀectual toconvey title to the purchaser and that such a sale cannot be avoided on the ground either of want of due noticegiven by the Receiver before eﬀecting the sale or on the ground of undervalue"".The result therefore is that the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs of the contesting Respondent3. The other Respondents who have appeared before us will bear and pay their own costs of the appeal."

As a result of enquiry and report by theCommissioner, the Government passed an order on the 25th November, 1944, dismissing the appellant fromservice, which order was served on the appellant on the 1st December, 1944.The appellant instituted a suit for a declaration that the order of dismissal passed against him was wrongful, illegaland inoperative, and that he continued to be in service and 'was entitled to a decree for recovery of arrears of hissalary. The plaint included an alternative prayer for a declaration that the order of dismissal was 50 392 wrongfuland for a decree for Rs. 1,20,000/- by way of damages being passed in his favour. The requisite court-fee on thevaluation of Rs. 1,20,000/- was paid. The claim for damages was later on abandoned in view of the decision of thePrivy Council in High Commissioner for India and High Commissioner for Pakistan v. I.M. Lal(1) and consequentialamendments were made in the plaint. The Civil Judge granted a declaration that the order of dismissal was illegaland that the appellant continued to be in service in spite of that order. But he declined to grant a decree for arrearsof salary on the ground that a suit therefor was not maintainable. A prayer for the refund of the additional court-fee paid in respect of the claim for damages was also refused. The respondent did not appeal against the decisionthat the order of dismissal was illegal. But the appellant took the matter in appeal to the High Court which,aﬃrming the decision of the Civil Judge, negatived his claim for arrears of salary and also refused refund of court-fee.Leave was, however, granted to appeal to the Supreme Court.In view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of The State of Bihar v. Abdul Majid(2), the respondent didnot dispute the right of the appellant to recover arrears of pay. But he sought to support the decision on theground that the order of dismissal dated the 25th November, 1944, having been declared to be illegal and void, theorder of suspension dated the 24th August, 1944, became revived and that that would bar the claim for arrears ofsalary.iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/15/3/9595959i95www.liiaase953.html16 9/12/ 2020OM PRAKASH GUPTA V.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM J.-This is an appeal against the decision of theAllahabad High Court aﬃrming the decision of the Civil Judge of Allahabad.The appellant was appointed to the United Provinces Civil (Executive) Service in 1940 and in due course wasconﬁrmed.He was posted to various stations and in 1944 he was posted to Lakhimpur Kheri, where he joined in July, 1944. Onthe 23rd August, 1944, the Deputy Commissioner of Lakhimpur Kheri received a telegram from Governmentinforming him that the appellant was suspended forthwith pending inquiry into his conduct and that a copy of thetelegram was forwarded to the appellant for information. On the 26th August, 1944, the Deputy Commissionerwrote to the appellant that he was required to appear before the Commissioner of the Lucknow Division on the28th August, 1944, to answer the charges, a copy of which would be forwarded to him. He further in.formed the appellant that he could treat his case under rule 55 of the Civil Services (Classiﬁcation Control andAppeal) Rules of 1930, published in the United Provinces Gazette of June 28, 1930. The appellant was furtherinformed that in view of his suspension his leave application was cancelled.On the 28th August, 1944, the appellant appeared before the Commissioner at Lucknow and protested against theprocedure adopted by him for the inquiry. The Commis- 394 sioner having - completed the inquiry on the 1stSeptember, 1944, submitted his report to Government. The Commissioner, however, recommenced the inquiry onSeptember 11, 1944, and after completing the inquiry submitted the papers to Government on the 30thSeptember, 1944. The Government of the United Provinces by an order dated the 25th November, 1944, dismissedthe appellant from the United Provinces Civil (Executive) Service. This order was served on the appellant on the 1stDecember, 1944, and he submitted a memorial to the Governor on August 7, 1945, which was rejected on the 28thMay, 1947. During the period of suspension the appellant was paid subsistence allowance at the rate of one-fourthof his salary which was then Rs. 310 per month.iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/15/3/9595959i95www.liiaase953.html26 9/12/ 2020OM PRAKASH GUPTA V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [15] INSC 33; AIR 15 SC 600; 15 (2) SCR 31 (21 Ap rl 15)The appellant gave notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure of his intention to bring a suit and on the2nd January, 1948, he ﬁled his suit. He asked for a declaration that the order of dismissal was wrongful, illegal, voidand inoperative and that he still continued to be a member of the Civil Service entitled to full pay with allincrements as they fell due. He prayed for a decree for recovery of arrears of salary amounting to Rs. 16,810-8-0less subsistence allowance already drawn from August 24, 1944, to December 31, 1947. In the alternative heprayed for a declaration that the order of dismissal was wrongful and that a decree to the extent of Rs. 1,20,000with interest by way of damages may be passed in his favour. He paid the requisite court fee on the valuation of Rs.1,20,000. This alternative claim was deleted from the plaint as a result of an amendment, having regard to asubsequent decision of the Privy Council* which held that a person illegally dismissed from Government servicecould only get a declaration that the order was inoperative and that he still continued to be a member of theService.The appellant asked for refund of the extra court fee paid which was rejected by the Civil Judge by a separateorder.The Civil Judge, however, decreed High Commissioner for India and High Commissioner for Pakistan v.1. M. Lal, [ 1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 225.395 the appellant's suit in part declaring that the order dismissing him from service was illegal and that he stillcontinued to be a member of the United Provinces Civil (Executive) Service. The Civil Judge, however, declined topass a decree for arrears of salary.Against the decision of the Civil Judge the appellant appealed to the High Court and his appeal was dismissed.The respondent did not appeal against the decision of the Civil Judge or ﬁle a cross-objection. The appeal in theHigh Court proceeded on the basis that the order of dismissal made against the appellant was illegal and that itwas rightly declared that he continued to be a member of the service of the United Provinces Civil (Executive)Service.The only two questions which were considered and decided by the High Court were as to whether the appellantwas entitled to a decree for arrears of salary and a refund of the excess court fee paid by him. Both these questionswere decided against the appellant by the High Court which subsequently gave him a certiﬁcate for leave toappeal to this court.It may be stated at once that in view of the decision of this court in The State of Bihar v. Abdul Majid(1) there canbe no question now that the appellant had the right to institute a suit for recovery of arrears of salary as he wasdismissed illegally. It is unnecessary, therefore, to refer to the elaborate discussion of the law in this respect to befound in the judgment of the learned Judges of the High Court.When this appeal came on for hearing before this court and the appellant had been heard the Attorney General inthe course of his argument bad contended that the order of suspension of August 1944 subsisted although theorder of dismissal had been declared illegal by the Civil Judge and all that the appellant was entitled to wassubsistence allowance and not salary so long as the order of suspension remained eﬀective. This plea was nottaken in the written statement ﬁled in the trial court, nor was there any issue framed in this respect. The Attorney-General (1) [ 1964] S.C.R. 780, 396 asked for time to ﬁle an additional written statement on behalf of therespondent. This court allowed time for the respondent to do so and the appellant was also given time to reply toany additional written statement ﬁled on behalf of the respondent. The respondent ﬁled the additional writtenstatement and the appellant ﬁled his reply to it.Thereafter the appeal came on for bearing again and the learned Advocate for the appellant made his submissionson the additional written statement and the Attorney-General replied to the same.So far as the payment of excess court fee is concerned, the learned Advocate for the appellant did not urge thispoint in his opening argument but urged it in reply after the Attorney-General bad concluded his argument. Apartfrom the question as to whether the Advocate can be allowed to urge a point like this in reply when no submissionhad been made by him in his opening, it seems there is no merit in the submission made by the Advocate. Thecourt fee had been paid on Rs. 1,20,000 which -was claimed as damages. At the time the suit was instituted thelaw as then understood permitted such a claim to be made. The decision of the Privy Council, however, made itiofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/15/3/9595959i95www.liiaase953.html36 9/12/ 2020OM PRAKASH GUPTA V.

The decision of thePrivy Council clarifying the position could not be a ground for refund of court fee when at the time it was paid itwas in accordance with the law as then understood. Indeed the appellant did not appeal or ﬁle an applicationagainst the order of the Civil Judge refusing to pass an order of refund. In the High Court he did not ask for thisrelief on the basis of any statutory provision. He invoked the inherent powers of the High Court. The Court FeesAct contains certain provisions for refund of court fee paid by a party but admittedly the present case is notcovered by any of those provisions. It seems, therefore, that the High Court in the circumstances of the presentcase rightly refused 397 to order a refund of the excess court fee paid by the appellant. It also does not appear thatthe Civil Judge acted illegally in refusing to order a refund.On the additional written statement ﬁled in this court by the respondent a question has arisen whether the orderof suspension was valid and during the period it was in force the appellant could recover arrears of salary. Thelearned Advocate for the appellant contended that an order of suspension is a penalty under rule 49 of theClassiﬁcation Rules and it was against all sense of natural justice to impose a penalty upon a Government servantpending an in- quiry against him under rule 55 of the said rules. An order imposing the penalty of suspension wasan appealable order under rule 56 of the Classiﬁcation Rules and under rule 59 of the said rules, an appellateauthority was bound to consider whether the facts on which the penalty was imposed had been established andwhether those facts disclosed suﬃcient grounds for imposing such a penalty. Rule 54 of the Fundamental Rulesauthorises a revising or an appellate authority, when it ﬁnds that the Penalty of suspension was unjustiﬁed or notwholly justiﬁed, to make an order granting to the Government servant his full pay and any allowance to which hewas entitled if he was honourably acquitted and in other cases such proportion of pay and allowances as it mayprescribe. The penalty of suspension, it was urged, involved serious loss in the matter of salary and allowances andto impose this penalty pending an inquiry was to prejudge the case against a Government servant and in eﬀect tomake his right of appeal a meaningless remedy. It was pointed out that in some of the rules framed by aGovernment or quasiGovernment authority the penalty of suspension pending an inquiry was speciﬁcally providedfor, such as rule 95 of the Bihar and Orissa Service Code re- ferred to in Abdul Majid's case and rule 1711 of theIndian Railway Establishment Code. On behalf of the appellant reference was also made to certain decisions to theeﬀect that as between master and servant, the master had no power of suspension unless 398 there was anexpress term to that eﬀect in the contract between them.The Attorney-General conceded that apart from the Classiﬁcation Rules and the Fundamental Rules he was notaware of any other rules under which the penalty of suspension could be imposed upon a Government servant. Healso conceded that under the Classiﬁcation Rules an order of suspension was a penalty. He further conceded thatas between master and servant the former had no power of suspension unless the terms of the contract betweenthem permitted it or a statute or a rule provided for it but this principle, he said, did not apply to a person in theservice of the Crown in India. He, however, contended that under rule 49 of the Classiﬁcation Rules a penalty ofsuspension could be imposed pending an inquiry. There was nothing in the rule itself which enjoined that a penaltycould only be imposed at the conclusion of an inquiry. The penalty could be imposed for good and suﬃcientreasons which may be based on materials already existing pending an inquiry.After the inquiry there may be the imposition of a severer penalty or a deﬁnite period of suspension may be ﬁxedor there may be cancellation of the order of suspension. No doubt there was a right of appeal against an orderimposing a penalty of suspension pending an inquiry but the provisions of rule 54 of the Fundamental Rules did notnecessarily lead to the conclusion that the penalty of suspension could only be imposed after an inquiry. Clause (a)of the said rule might contemplate a case where the penalty had been imposed after an inquiry but clause (b) couldcover a case where the penalty had been imposed pending an inquiry. In the present case, he said, there was nocontravention of any principle of natural justice as the appellant had an opportunity of explaining the accusationmade against him. The letter of the -Commissioner of Lucknow Division with its annexure, marked Exhibit A in thetrial court, clearly showed that the Deputy Commissioner, Lakhimpur Kheri had recorded statements of personswith ref- erence to three cases and the appellant saw him in 399 connection therewith. He admitted the facts buttried to explain them. He, however, declined to give his statement in writing. The order of suspension madeagainst him was based on materials of which he was fully aware.In the alternative the Attorney-General urged that in the year 1944 the appellant was a member of the Civil Serviceof the Crown in India holding oﬃce during the pleasure of the Crown. There was, therefore, inherent power in theCrown and its representative to pass an order of suspension against the appellant pending an inquiry. TheClassiﬁcation Rules and Fundamental Rules were merely directions for general guidance and they did notiofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/15/3/9595959i95www.liiaase953.html46 9/12/ 2020OM PRAKASH GUPTA V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [15] INSC 33; AIR 15 SC 600; 15 (2) SCR 31 (21 Ap rl 15)constitute a contract between the Crown and its servants. For this proposition he referred to the observations ofLord Hobhouse in the case of Shenton v. Smith(1). He also relied upon the following observations of Lord Roche inthe case of B.Venkata Rao v. Secretary of State for India in Council (2) .""Section 96-B in express terms states that oﬃce is held during pleasure. There is, therefore, no need for theimplication of this term and no room for its exclusion. The argument for a limited and special kind of employmentduring pleasure but with an added contractual term that the rules are to be observed is at once too artiﬁcial andtoo far- reaching to commend itself for acceptance. The rules are manifold in number and most minute inparticularity, and are all capable of change............................. Incon- venience is not a ﬁnal consideration in amatter of construction, but it is at least worthy of consideration and it can hardly be doubted that the suggestedprocedure of control by the Courts over Government in the most detailed work of managing its services wouldcause not merely inconvenience but confusion"".In the courts below the principal question for consideration was whether the appellant could recover arrears ofsalary having been illegally dismissed. It was not pleaded that the order of suspension was (1) [ 1895] UKLawRpAC4; [ 1895] A.C. 229.(2) L.R. 64 I.A. 55.51 400 valid and during the period it was in force the appellant could not recover arrears of salary and no speciﬁcissue was framed in this respect. If the decision of this court in Abdul Majid's case had been available to the courtsbelow, they would have held that the appellant was entitled to recover arrears of salary when he had been illegallydismissed and they would have bad further to decide whether the order of suspension was valid and during theperiod it was in force the appellant could recover arrears of salary.On the additional written statement ﬁled by the respondent in this court, the submissions of the Advocate for theappellant and the Attorney-General would require examination and it might have been necessary to considerwhether the case should not be remanded to the court of trial. It is unnecessary, however, to record a decision onthese submissions having regard to the attitude adopted by the Advocate for the appellant. He objected to thecase being remanded as such a course would involve the appellant in heavy expenditure and harassment. Theappellant preferred to give up his claim for arrears of salary less subsistence allowance paid to him from the dateof the order of suspension until the date of the order of dismissal. He, however contended that the order ofsuspension continued to be in force only until the 25th November, 1944, the date of the order, of dismissal. Onthat date the order of suspension ceased to exist and the appellant was entitled to recover arrears of salary fromthe 25th November, 1944, to the 31st December, 1947, inclusive. The Attorney-General strongly contended that itcontinued to be in force and that it was not at all aﬀected by the declaration of the Civil -- judge that the order ofdismissal was illegal. In view of that decision the order of dismissal must be regarded as a nullity and non-existentin the eye of law. The inquiry, the outcome of which was the order of dismissal, had not therefore ended. It couldonly end with a valid order which would replace the order of suspension Until that happened the accusationagainst the appellant remained and the inquiry had not ended. He referred to the case of M. Gopal Krishna Naiduv.401 State of Madhya Pradesh(1). On behalf of the appellant reliance was placed on the case of ProvincialGovernment, Central Provinces and Berar through Collector, Amraoti v.Shamshul Hussain Siraj Hussain(2). The order of suspension made against the appellant was clearly one madepending an inquiry. It certainly was not a penalty imposed after an enquiry. As the result of the inquiry an order ofdismissal by way of penalty had been passed against the appellant.With that order, the order of suspension lapsed. The order of dismissal replaced the order of suspension whichthen ceased to exist. That clearly was the position between the Government of the United Provinces and theappellant. The subsequent declaration by a Civil Court that the order of dismissal was illegal could not revive anorder of suspension which did not exist. The case referred to by the Attorney-General is not directly in point andthat decision does not conﬂict with the case relied upon by the appellant. The appellant is, therefore, entitled torecover arrears of salary from the 25th of November, 1944, to 31st December, 1947.The appeal is accordingly allowed in part with costs throughout and the decree of the courts below is set; aside.iofin d.org/in/cs/cen/INSC/15/3/9595959i95www.liiaase953.html56 9/12/ 2020OM PRAKASH GUPTA V. THE ST ATE OF UTTAR PRADESH [15] INSC 33; AIR 15 SC 600; 15 (2) SCR 31 (21 Ap rl 15)The plaintiﬀ 's suit is decreed for arrears of salary from the 25th of November, 1944, to the 31st of December, 1947,inclusive. The appellant had claimed Rs. 16,810-8-0 less subsistence allowance already drawn as arrears of payfrom the 24th of August, 1944, to the 31st December, 1947. As his claim for arrears of salary from the 24th ofAugust, 1944, to the 25th of November, 1944, is given up, the total salary payable to him during this period lesssubsistence allowance already drawn, must be deducted from the sum of Rs. 16, 810-8-0. The judgment of theHigh Court as well as the additional written statement ﬁled by the respondent in this court show that subsequentto the decree passed by the Civil Judge the appellant was treated as under suspension until he was dismissed by afresh order of (1) A.I.R. 1952 Nag. 170.(2) I.L R. 1948 Nag. 576; A.I.R. (36) 1949 Nag. 118.402 dismissal and that he has been paid subsistence allowance for the entire period. Such subsistence allowanceas has been paid to the appellant from the 25th of November, 1944, to the 31st December, 1947 inclusive, must,therefore, be credited to the respondent and the same must be adjusted against the salary claimed by theappellant. A decree will accordingly be prepared stating the amount recoverable by the appellant.The appellant was permitted to appeal in forma pauperism As he has succeeded in the appeal, the Registrar shallcalculate the amount of court fee which would have been paid by the appellant if he had not been allowed toappeal as a pauper and incorporate it in the decree. The court fee shall be paid by the appellant and the same willbe recoverable by the Government of India from him and shall be the ﬁrst charge on the amount-decreed to him.Under Rule 7 of Order XIV of the Rules of this Court., the appellant will be allowed the fees paid by him to hisAdvocates, in the taxation of costs."

THE STATE OF PUNJAB [1955] INSC 34 (22 April 1955).pdf,"For a long period of time prior to 1950 the text books for recognised schools in the State of Punjab were preparedby private publishers with their own money and under their own arrangements and they were submitted for theapproval of the Government. The Government approved some books on each subject as alternative text books,leaving it to the discretion of the Head Masters of diﬀerent schools to select any alternative book on each subject.In May 1950 books on certain subjects (like agriculture, history, social studies, etc.) were prepared and publishedby the Government themselves without inviting oﬀers from private publishers.With respect to other subjects, oﬀers were invited from ""publishers and authors"". The alternative method wasgiven up and only one text book on ,each subject was selected.The Government charged as royalty 5% on the sale price of all the approved text books. In 1952 a notiﬁcation wasissued by the Government which omitted the word ""Publishers"" altogether and invited only ""authors and others""to submit books for approval by the Government. The ""authors and others"" whose books were approved, had toenter into an agreement in the form prescribed by the Government the principal term of the agreement was thatthe copyright in these books would vest absolutely in Government and the authors and others"" would get a royaltyof 5% on the sale price of the text books.

In the present case no fundamental rights of thepetitioners were violated by the notiﬁcations and the acts of the executive Government of the Punjab done bythem in furtherance of their policy of nationalisation of the text books for the school students.A more chance or prospect of having particular customers cannot be said to be a right to property or to anyinterest or undertaking within the meaning of Art. 31(2) of the Constitution and no question of payment ofcompensation can arise because the petitioners have been deprived of the same..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/19 55/34.html/020www18 9/12/2RAI SAHI B RAM JAWA YA KAPUR& ORS V.

They do not mean-that it isonly when Parliament or the State Legislature has legislated on certain items appertaining to their respective liststhat the Union executive or the State executive, as the case may be,can proceed to function in respect of them.

J.-This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution, preferred by six persons, who purport tocarry on the business of preparing, printing, publishing and, selling text books for diﬀerent classes in the schools ofPunjab, particularly for the primary and middle classes, under the name and style ""Uttar Chand Kapur & Sons"". It isalleged that the Education Department of the Punjab Government has in pursuance of their so-called policy ofnationalisation of text books, issued a series of notiﬁcations since 1950 regarding the printing, publication and saleof these books which have not only placed unwarrantable restrictions upon the rights of the petitioners to carry ontheir business but have practically ousted them and other fellow-traders from the business altogether. It is saidthat no restrictions could be imposed upon the petitioners' right to carry on the trade which is guaranteed underarticle 19(1)(g) of the Constitution by mere executive orders without proper legislation and that the legislation, ifany, must conform to the requirements of clause (6) of article 19 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the petitionerspray for writs in the nature of mandamus directing the Punjab Government to withdraw the notiﬁcations whichhave aﬀected their rights.To appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the learned counsel who appeared for the parties beforeus, it will be necessary to narrate certain relevant facts. In the State of Punjab, all recognised schools have got tofollow the course of studies approved by the Education Department of the Government and the use, by the pupils,of the text books prescribed or authorised by the Department is a con- dition precedent to the granting ofrecognition to a 228 school. For a long period of time prior to 1950, the method adopted by the Government forselection and approval of text books for recognised schools was commonly known as the alternative method andthe procedure followed was shortly this: Books on relevant subjects, in accordance with the principles laid down bythe Education Department, were prepared by the publishers with their own money and under their ownarrangements and they were submitted for approval of the Government. The Education Department after properscrutiny selected books numbering between 3 and 10 or even more on each subject as alternative text books,leaving it to the discretion of the Head Masters of the diﬀerent schools, to select any one of the alternative bookson a particular subject out of the approved list. The Government ﬁxed the prices as well as the size and contents ofthe books and when these things were done it was left to the publishers to print, publish and sell the books to thepupils of diﬀerent schools according to the choice made by their respective Head Masters. Authors, who were notpub- lishers, could also submit books for approval and if any of their books were approved, they had to makearrangements for publishing the same and usually they used to select some one of the publishers already on theline to do the work..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/19 55/34.html/020www28 9/12/2RAI SAHI B RAM JAWA YA KAPUR& ORS V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJA B [1955] INSC 34 (22 April 1955)This procedure, which was in vogue since 1905, was altered in material particulars on and from May 1950. Bycertain resolutions of the Government passed on or about that time, the whole of the territory of Punjab, as itremained in the Indian Union after partition, was divided into three Zones.The text books on certain subjects like agriculture, history, social studies, etc. for all the zones were prepared andpublished by the Government without inviting them from the publishers. With respect to the remaining subjects,oﬀers were still invited from ""publishers and authors"" but the alternative system was given up and only one textbook on each subject for each class in a particular zone was selected. Another change introduced at this time wasthat the Government charged, as royalty, 5% on the sale price of all the 229 approved text books. The resulttherefore was that the Government at this time practically took upon themselves the monopoly of publishing thetextbooks on some of the subjects and with regard to the rest also, they reserved for themselves a certain royaltyupon the sale proceeds.Changes of a far more drastic character however were introduced in the year 1952 by a notiﬁcation of theEducation Department issued on the 9th of August 1952 and it is against this notiﬁcation that the complaints ofthe petitioners are mainly directed. This notiﬁcation omitted the word ""publishers"" altogether and invited only the""authors and others"" to submit books for approval by the Government. These ""authors and others"", whose bookswere selected, bad to enter into agreements in the form prescribed by the Government and the principal terms ofthe agreement were that the copyright in these books would vest absolutely in the Government and the ""authorsand others"" would only get a royalty at the rate of 5% on the sale of the text books at the price or prices speciﬁedin the list.Thus the publishing, printing and selling of the books were taken by the Government exclusively in their ownhands and the private publishers were altogether ousted from this business. The 5% royalty, in substance,represents the price for the sale of the copyright and it is paid to an author or any other person who, not being theauthor, is the owner of the copyright and is hence competent in law to transfer the same to the Government. It isagainst these notiﬁcations of 1950 and 1952 that the present petition under article 32 of the Constitution isdirected and the petitioners pray for withdrawal of these notiﬁcations on the ground that they contravene thefundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under the Constitution.The contentions raised by Mr. Pathak, who appeared in support of the petitioners, are of a three-fold character.It is contended in the ﬁrst place that the executive Government of a State is wholly incompetent, without anylegislative sanction, to engage in any trade or business activity and that the acts of 230 the Government in carryingout their policy of establishing monopoly in the business of printing and publishing text books for school studentsis wholly without jurisdiction and illegal. His second contention is, that assuming that the State could create amonopoly in its favour in respect of a particular trade or business, that could be done not by any executive act butby means of a proper legislation which should conform to the requirements of article 19(6) of the Constitution.Lastly, it is argued that it was not open to the Government to deprive the petitioners of their interest in anybusiness or undertaking which amounts to property without authority of law and without payment ofcompensation as is required under article 31 of the Constitution.The ﬁrst point raised by Mr. Pathak, in substance, amounts to this, that the Government has no power in law tocarry on the business of printing or selling text books for the use of school students in competition with privateagencies without the sanction of the legislature. It is not argued that the functions of a modern State like thepolice States of old are conﬁned to mere collection of taxes or maintenance of laws and protection of the realmfrom external or internal enemies. A modern State is certainly expected to engage in all activities necessary for thepromotion of the social and economic welfare of the community. What Mr. Pathak says, however, is, that as ourConstitution clearly recognises a division of governmental functions into three categories, viz., the legislative, thejudicial and the executive, the function of the executive cannot but be to execute the laws passed by thelegislature or to supervise the enforcement of the same. The legislature must ﬁrst enact a measure which theexecutive can then carry out. The learned counsel has, in support of this contention, placed considerable relianceupon articles 73 and 162 of our Constitution-and also upon certain decided authorities of the Australian High Courtto which we shall presently refer.Article 73 of the Constitution relates to the executive powers of the Union, while the corresponding 231 provisionin regard to the executive powers of a State is contained in article 162. The provisions of these articles areanalogous to those of sections 8 and 49 (2) respectively of the Government of India Act, 1935 and lay down the ruleof distribution of executive powers between the Union and the States, following, the same analogy as is provided.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/19 55/34.html/020www38 9/12/2RAI SAHI B RAM JAWA YA KAPUR& ORS V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJA B [1955] INSC 34 (22 April 1955)in regard to the distribution of legislative powers between them. Article 162, with which we are directly concernedin this case, lays down:""Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters withrespect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws:Provided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to makelaws, the executive power of the State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferredby this Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof"".Thus under this article the executive authority of the State is exclusive in respect to matters enumerated in List IIof Seventh Schedule. The authority also extends to the Concurrent List except as provided in the Constitutionitself or in any law passed by the Parliament. Similarly, article 73 provides that the executive powers of the Unionshall extend to matters with respect to which the Parliament has power to make laws and to the exercise of suchrights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by the Govern- ment of India by virtue of any treaty or anyagreement. The proviso engrafted on clause (1) further lays down that although with regard to the matters in theConcurrent List the executive authority shall be ordinarily left to the State it would be open to the Parliament toprovide that in exceptional cases the executive power of the Union shall extend to these matters also. Neither ofthese articles contain any deﬁnition as to what the executive function is and what activities would legitimatelycome within its scope. They are concerned primarily with the distri- 232 bution of the executive power betweenthe Union on the one hand and the States on the other. They do not mean, as Mr.Pathak seems to suggest, that it is only when the Parliament or the State Legislature has legislated on certainitems appertaining to their respective lists, that the Union or the State executive, as the case may be, can proceedto function in respect to them. On the other hand, the language of article 162 clearly indicates that the powers ofthe State executive do extend to matters upon which the State Legislature is competent to legislate and are notcon- ﬁned to matters over which legislation has been passed already. The same principle underlies article 73 of theConstitution. These provisions of the Constitution therefore do not lend any support to Mr. Pathak's contention.The Australian cases upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel do not, in our opinion, appear tobe of much help either. In the ﬁrst(1) of these cases, the executive Government of the Commonwealth during thecontinuance of the war, entered into a number of agreements with a company which was engaged in themanufacture and sale of wool-tops. The agreements were of diﬀerent types. By one class of agreements, theCommonwealth Government gave consent to the sale of wool-tops by the company in return for a share of the -proﬁts of the transactions (called by the parties ""a licence fee""). Another class provided that the business ofmanufacturing wool-tops should be carried on by the company as agents for the Commonwealth in considerationof the company receiving an annual sum from the Commonwealth. The rest of the agreements were acombination of these two varieties. It was held by a Full Bench of the High Court that apart from any authorityconferred by an Act of Parliament or by regulations thereunder, the executive Government of the Commonwealthhad no power to make or ratify any of these agreements. The decision, it may be noticed, was based substantiallyupon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Constitution which is worded as follows:(1) The Commtmonwwealth and the Central Wool Committee v.The Colonial Combining, Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., [ 1922] HCA 62; 31 C.L.R. 421.233 ""The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercised by the Governor-Generalas the Queen's representative and extends to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and of the lawsof the Commonwealth"", In addition to this, the King could assign other functions and powers to the Governor-General under section 2 but in this particular case no assignment of any additional powers was alleged or proved.The court held that the agreements were not directly authorised by the Parliament or under the provisions of anystatute and as they were not for the execution and maintenance of the Constitution they must be held to be void.Isacs, J., in his judgment, dealt elabo- rately with the two types of agreements and held that the agreements, sofar as they purported to bind the company to pay to the Government money, as the price of consents, amountedto the imposition of a tax and were void without the authority of Parliament. The other kind of agreements whichpurported to bind the Government to pay to the company a remuneration for manufacturing wool-tops was heldto be an appropriation of public revenue and being without legislative authority was also void..liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/19 55/34.html/020www48 9/12/2RAI SAHI B RAM JAWA YA KAPUR& ORS V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJA B [1955] INSC 34 (22 April 1955)It will be apparent that none of the principles indicated above could have any application to the circumstances ofthe present case. There is no provision in our Constitution corresponding to section 61 of the Australian Act. TheGovernment has not imposed anything like taxation or licence fee in the present case nor have we been told thatthe appropriation of public revenue involved in the so-called business in text books carried on by the Governmenthas not been sanctioned by the legislature by proper Appropriation Acts.The other case(1) is of an altogether diﬀerent character and arose in the following way. The CommonwealthGovernment had established a clothing factory in Melbourne for the purpose of making naval and militaryuniforms for the- defence forces and (1) Vide Attorney-General for Victoria v. The Commonwealth [ 1935] HCA 31;52 C.L.R 533 30 234 postal employees. In times of peace the operations of the factory included the supply ofuniforms for other departments of the Commonwealth and for employees in various public utility services. TheGovernor-General deemed such peace-time operations of the factory necessary for the eﬃcient defence of theCommonwealth inasmuch as the maintenance intact of the trained complement of the factory would assist inmeeting wartime demands. A question arose as to whether operations of the factory for such purposes in peace:-time were authorised by the Defence Act. The majority of the court answered the question in the aﬃrmative.Starke, J. delivered a dissenting opinion upon which Mr. Pathak mainly relied. The learned Judge laid stress onsection 61 of the Constitution Act according to which the executive power of the Commonwealth extended to themaintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth and held that there was nothing in theConstitution or any law of the Commonwealth which enabled the Commonwealth to establish and maintainclothing factories for other than Commonwealth purposes. The opinion, whether right or wrong, turns upon theparticular facts of the case and upon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Act and it cannot and does notthrow any light on the question that requires decision in the present case.A question very similar to that in the present case did arise for consideration before a Full Bench of the AllahabadHigh Court in Motilal v. The Government of the State of Uttar Pradesh(1). The point canvassed there was whetherthe Government of a State has power under the Constitution to carry on the trade or business of running a busservice in the absence of a legislative enactment authorising the State Government to do so. Diﬀerent views wereexpressed by diﬀerent Judges on this question. Chief Justice Malik was of opinion that in a written Constitution likeours the executive power may be such as is given to the executive or is implied, ancillary or inherent.(1) A.I.R. 1951 Allahabad 257.235 It must include all powers that may be needed to carry into eﬀect the aims and objects of the Constitution. Itmust mean more than merely executing the laws. According to the Chief Justice the State has a right to hold andmanage its own property and carry on such trade or business as a citizen has the right to carry on, so long as suchactivity does not encroach upon the rights of others or is not contrary to law. The running of a transport businessthere- fore was not per se outside the ambit of the executive authority of the State. Sapru, J. held that the powerto run a Government bus service was incidental to the power of acquiring property which was expressly conferredby article 298 of the Constitution. Mootham and Wanchoo, JJ., who delivered a common judgment, were also ofthe opinion that there was no need for a speciﬁc legislative enactment to enable a State Government to run a busservice. In the opinion of these learned Judges an act would be within the executive power of the State if it is notan act which has been assigned by the Constitution of India to other authorities or bodies and is not contrary to theprovisions of any law and does not encroach upon the legal rights of any member of the public. Agarwala, J.dissented from the majority view and held that the State Government had no power to run a bus service in theabsence of an Act of the legislature authorising the State to do so. The opinion of Agarwala J. undoubtedlysupports the contention of Mr.Pathak but it appears to us to be too narrow and unsupportable.It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive deﬁnition of what executive function means and implies. Ordinarilythe executive power connotes the residue of governmental functions that remain after legislative and judicialfunctions are taken away. The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the doctrine of separation of powersin its absolute rigidity but the functions of the diﬀerent parts or branches of the Government have been suﬃcientlydiﬀerentiated and consequently it can very well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate 236assumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions that-essentially belong to another. The executiveindeed can exercise the powers of departmental or subordinate legislation when such powers are delegated to itby the legislature. It can also, when so empowered, exercise judicial functions in a limited way. The executiveGovernment, however, can never go against the provisions of the Constitution or of any law. This is clear from theprovisions of article 154 of the Constitution but, as we have already stated, it does not follow from this that in.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/19 55/34.html/020www58 9/12/2RAI SAHI B RAM JAWA YA KAPUR& ORS V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJA B [1955] INSC 34 (22 April 1955)order to enable the executive to function there must be a law already in existence and that the powers of theexecutive are limited merely to the carrying out of these laws.The limits within which the executive Government can function under the Indian Constitution can be ascertainedwithout much diﬃculty by reference to the form of the executive which our Constitution has set up. OurConstitution, though federal in its structure, is modelled on the British Parliamentary system where the executiveis deemed to have the primary responsibility for the formulation of governmental policy and its transmission intolaw though the condition precedent to the exercise of this responsibility is its retaining the conﬁdence of thelegislative branch of the State. The executive function comprises both the determination of the policy as well ascarrying it into execution. This evidently includes the initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order, thepromotion of social and economic welfare, the direction of foreign policy, in fact the carrying on or supervision ofthe general administration of the State.In India, as in England, the executive has to act subject to the control of the legislature; but in what way is thiscontrol exercised by the legislature? Under article 53(1) of our Constitution, the executive power of the Union isvested in the President but under article 75 there is to be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the headto aid and advise the President in the exercise of his functions. The President has thus been made a formal orconstitutional 237 head of the executive and the real executive powers are vested in the Ministers or the Cabinet.The same provisions obtain in regard to the Government of States; the Governor or the Rajpramukh, as the casemay be, occupies the position of the head of the executive in the State but it is virtually the council of Ministers ineach State that carries on the executive Government. In the Indian Constitution, therefore, we have the samesystem of parliamentary executive as in England and the council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of themembers of the legislature is, like the British Cabinet, ""a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens the legislativepart of the State to the executive part"". The Cabinet enjoying, as it does, a majority in the legislature concentratesin itself the virtual control of both legislative and executive func- tions; and as the 'Ministers constituting theCabinet are presumably agreed on fundamentals and act on the principle of collective responsibility, the mostimportant questions of policy are all formulated by them.Suppose now that the Ministry or the executive Government of a State formulates a particular policy infurtherance of which they want to start a trade or business. Is it necessary that there must be a speciﬁc legislationlegalising such trade activities before they could be embarked upon? We cannot say that such legislation is alwaysnecessary. If the trade or business involves expenditure of funds, it is certainly required that Parliament shouldauthorise such expenditure either directly or under the provisions of a statute. What is generally done in such casesis, that the sums required for carrying on the business are entered in the annual ﬁnancial statement which theMinistry has to lay before the House or Houses of Legislature in respect of every ﬁnancial year under article 202 ofthe Constitution. So much of the esti- mates as relate to expenditure other than those charged on theconsolidated fund are submitted in the form of demands for grants to the legislature and the legislature has thepower to assent or refuse to assent to any such demand or assent to a demand subject to reduc- 238 tion of theamount (article 203). After the grant is sanctioned, an Appropriation Bill is introduced to provide for theappropriation out of the consolidated fund of the State of all moneys required to meet the grants thus made bythe Assembly (article 204). As soon as the Appropriation Act is passed, the expenditure made under the headscovered by it would be deemed to be properly authorised by law under article 266(3) of the Constitution.It may be, as Mr. Pathak contends, that the Appropriation Acts are no substitute for speciﬁc legislation and thatthey validate only the expenses out of the consolidated funds for the particular years for which they are passed;but nothing more than that may be necessary for carrying on of the trade or business. Under article 266(3) of theConstitution no moneys out of the consolidated funds of India or the consolidated fund of a State shall beappropriated except in accordance with law and for the purposes and in the manner provided in this Constitution.The expression ""law"" here obviously includes the Appro- priation Acts. It is true that the Appropriation Acts cannotbe said to give a direct legislative sanction to the trade activities themselves. But SO long as the trade activities arecarried on in pursuance of the policy which the executive Government has formulated with the tacit support of themajority in, the legislature, no objection on the score of their not being sanctioned by speciﬁc legislative provisioncan possibly be raised. Objections could be raised only in regard to the expenditure of public funds for carrying onof the trade or business and to these the Appropriation Acts would aﬀord a complete answer.Speciﬁc legislation may indeed be necessary if the Government require certain powers in addition to what theypossess under ordinary law in order to carry on the particular trade or business. Thus when it is necessary to.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/19 55/34.html/020www68 9/12/2RAI SAHI B RAM JAWA YA KAPUR& ORS V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJA B [1955] INSC 34 (22 April 1955)encroach upon private rights in order to enable the Government to carry on their business, a speciﬁc legislationsanctioning such course would have to be passed.239 In the present case it is not disputed that the entire expenses necessary for carrying on the business of printingand publishing the text books for recognised schools in Punjab were estimated and shown in the annual ﬁnancialstatement and that the demands for grants, which were made under diﬀerent heads, were sanctioned by the StateLegislature and due Appropriation Acts were passed. For the purpose of carrying on the business the Governmentdo not require any additional powers and whatever is necessary for their purpose, they can have by entering intocontracts with authors and other people. This power of contract is expressly vested in the Government underarticle 298 of the Constitution. In these circumstances, we are unable to agree with Mr. Pathak that the carrying onof the business of printing and publishing text books was beyond the competence of the executive Governmentwithout a speciﬁc legislation sanctioning such course.These discussions however are to some extent academic and are not suﬃcient by themselves to dispose of thepetitioners' case. As we have said already, -the executive Government are bound to conform not only to the law ofthe land but also to the provisions of the Constitution. The Indian Constitution is a written Constitution and eventhe legislature cannot override the fundamental rights guaranteed by it to the citizens. Consequently, even if theacts of the executive are deemed to be sanctioned by the legislature, yet they can be declared to be void andinoperative if they infringe any of the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Part III of the Consti-tution. On the other hand, even if the acts of the executive are illegal in the sense that they are not warranted bylaw, but no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been infringed thereby, the latter would obviously have noright to complain under article 32 of the Constitution though they may have remedies elsewhere if other heads ofrights are infringed. The material question for consideration therefore is: What fundamental rights of thepetitioners, if any, have been violated by the notiﬁcations 240 and acts of the executive Government of Punjabundertaken by them in furtherance of their policy of nationalisation of the text books for the school students? Thepetitioners claim fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which guarantees, inter alia, to allpersons the right to carry on any trade or business.The business which the petitioners have been carrying on is that of printing and publishing books for sale includingtext books used in the primary and middle classes of the schools in Punjab. Ordinarily it is for the school authoritiesto prescribe the text books that are to be used by the students and if these text books are available in the marketthe pupils can purchase them from any book-seller they like. There is no fundamental right in the publishers thatany of the books printed and published by them should be prescribed as text books by the school authorities or ifthey are once accepted as text books they cannot be stopped or discontinued in future. With regard to the schoolswhich are recognised by the Government the position of the pub- lishers is still worse. The recognised schoolsreceive aids of various kinds from the Government including grants for the maintenance of the institutions, forequipment, furniture, scholarships and other things and the pupils of the recognised schools are admitted to theschool ﬁnal examinations at lower rates of fees than those demanded from the students of non-recognisedschools. Under the school code, one of the main conditions upon which recognition is granted by Government isthat the school authorities must use as text books only those which are prescribed or autho- rised by theGovernment. So far therefore as the recognised schools are concerned-and we are concerned only with theseschools in the present case the choice of text books rests entirely with the Government and it is for theGovernment to decide in which way the selection of these text books is to be made. The procedure hithertofollowed was that the Government used to invite publishers and authors to submit their books for examinationand approval by 241 the Education Department and after selection was made by the Government, the size,contents as well as the prices of the books were ﬁxed and it was left to the publishers or authors to print andpublish them and oﬀer them for sale to the pupils. So long as this system was in vogue the only right whichpublishers, like the petitioners had, was to oﬀer their books for inspection and approval by the Govern- ment. Theyhad no right to insist on any of their books being accepted as text books. So the utmost that could be said is thatthere was merely a chance or prospect of any or some of their books being approved as text books by theGovernment. Such chances are incidental to all trades and businesses and there is no fundamental rightguaranteeing them. A trader might be lucky in securing a particular market for his goods but if he loses that ﬁeldbecause the particular customers for some reason or other do not choose to buy goods from him, it is not open tohim to say that it was his fundamental right to have his old customers for ever. On the one hand, therefore, therewas nothing but a chance or prospect which the publishers had of-having their books approved by theGovernment, on the other hand the Government had the undisputed right to adopt any method of selection theyliked and if they ultimately decided that after approving the text books they would purchase the copyright in themfrom the authors and others provided the latter were willing to transfer the same to the Government on certain.liiofindia.org/in/cases/cen/INSC/19 55/34.html/020www78 9/12/2RAI SAHI B RAM JAWA YA KAPUR& ORS V. THE ST A TE OF PUNJA B [1955] INSC 34 (22 April 1955)terms, we fail to see what right of the publishers to carry on their trade or business is aﬀected by it. Nobody istaking away the publishers' right to print and publish any books they like and to oﬀer them for sale but if they haveno right that their books should be approved as text books by the Government it is immaterial so far as they areconcerned whether the Government approves of text books submitted by other persons who are willing to selltheir copyrights in the books to them, or choose to engage authors for the purpose of preparing the text bookswhich they take up on themselves to print 31 242 and publish. We are unable to appreciate the argument of Mr.Pathak that the Government while exercising their undoubted right of approval cannot attach to it a conditionwhich has no bearing on the purpose for which the approval is made. We fail to see how the petitioners' position isin any way improved thereby. The action of the Government may be good or bad. It may be criticised andcondemned in the Houses of the Legislature or outside but this does not amount to an infraction of thefundamental right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.As in our view the petitioners have no fundamental right in the present case which can be said to have beeninfringed by the action of the Government, the petition is bound to fail on that ground. This being the position, theother two points raised by Mr. Pathak do not require consideration at all. As the petitioners have no fundamentalright under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution, the question whether the Government could establish a monopolywithout any legislation under article 19(6) of the Constitution is altogether immaterial. Again a mere chance orprospect of having particular customers cannot be said to be a right to property or to any interest in anundertaking within the meaning of article 31(2) of the Constitution and no question of payment of compensationcan arise because the petitioners have been deprived of the same. The result is that the petition is dismissed withcosts.PETITIONS NOS. 71 TO 77 AND 85 OF 1955.MUKHERJEA C. J.-These 8 petitions under article 32 of the Constitution raise identically the same points forconsideration as are involved in Petition No. 652 of 1954 just disposed of. The petitioners in these cases alsopurport to be printers, publishers and sellers of text-books for various classes in the schools of Punjab and theycomplain of infraction of their fundamental rights under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution by reason of thevarious notiﬁcations issued by the State of Punjab in pursuance of their policy 243 of nationalisation of text books.The learned counsel appearing in these cases have adopted in their entirety the arguments that have beenadvanced by Mr. Pathak in Petition No. 652 of 1954 and no fresh or additional argument has been put forward byany one of them. This being the position the decision in Petition No. 652 of 1954 will govern these petitions alsoand they will stand dismissed but we would make no order as to costs.LIIofIndia: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy |"
